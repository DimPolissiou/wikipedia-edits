The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the [[Apostolical Constitutions]] (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an [[Black Fast|absolute fast]] is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.<ref>Apostolical Constitutions v. 18, 19</ref>\n\nThere is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding [[Easter Day]], and also for the seven which followed it. The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.).\n\nOf the particular days of the \"great week\" the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally Good Friday. Next came the ''Sabbatum Magnum'' (\"Great Sabbath\", i.e., [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve) with its [[Paschal vigil|vigil]], which in the [[early church]] was associated with an expectation that the [[second advent]] would occur on an Easter Day.\n\nOther writings that refer to related traditions of the early Church include, most notably, ''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'' (also known as ''The Pilgrimage of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]]''), which details the whole observance of Holy Week at that time.\n\nToday, in the [[Western Christian Church]], among Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Catholics, the liturgies used for Holy Week are nearly identical.<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\">{{cite book|last=Ramshaw|first=Gail|title=The Three-Day Feast: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbb9axN6qFwC&pg=PA7|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2004|publisher=Augsburg Books|quote=Many Christians are already familiar with the ancient, and now recently restored, liturgies of the Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the great Easter Vigil service of light, readings, baptism, and communion.

Traditionally, Palm Sunday commemorates the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] described in all four [[canonical gospel]]s.  As described in the accounts, Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was noted by the crowds present who shouted praises and waved [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]]. In the Roman Rite, before 1955 it was known simply as Palm Sunday, and the preceding Sunday as Passion Sunday. From 1955 to 1971 it was called Second Sunday in [[Passiontide]] or Palm Sunday.

The blessing ceremony includes the reading of a Gospel account of how Jesus rode into Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, reminiscent of a Davidic victory procession, and how people placed palms and other branches on the ground in front of him. Immediately following this great time of celebration over the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, he begins his journey to the cross. The blessing is thus followed by a procession or solemn entrance into the church, with the participants holding the blessed branches in their hands. The Mass or liturgy of worship itself includes a reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the narrative of Jesus' capture, sufferings and death, as recounted in one of the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. (In the [[Tridentine Mass]] the Passion narrative read on this day is always that of St. Matthew.)\n\nBefore the reform of the rite by [[Pope Pius XII]], the blessing of the palms occurred inside the church within a liturgy that followed the general outline of a Mass, with Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as far as the Sanctus. The palms were then blessed with five prayers, and a procession went out of the church and on its return included a ceremony for the reopening of the doors, which had meantime been shut. After this the normal Mass was celebrated.<ref name=prePXII>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal]</ref>\n\n===Holy Monday to Spy Wednesday===\n[[File:Catholic_Tenebrae_service.jpg|thumb|left|A Tenebrae liturgy held at a Roman Catholic parish church on Spy Wednesday (2019)]]\nThe days between Palm Sunday and Holy Thursday are known as [[Holy Monday]], [[Holy Tuesday]], and [[Spy Wednesday]] (Holy Wednesday).  The Gospel accounts are not always clear or in agreement on the events which occurred on these days, though there are traditional observances held by some denominations to commemorate certain events from the last days of Jesus' life.  Among them\n\n* On Holy Monday, some observe the anointing of Jesus at Bethany,<ref>{{bibleref2|John|12:1\u201311}}</ref> an event that in the Gospel of John occurred before the Palm Sunday event described in John 12:12\u201319.  Other events which the Gospels tell of which may have occurred on this day include [[cursing the fig tree]] and the [[Cleansing of the Temple]].\n* On Holy Tuesday, some observe Jesus' predictions of his own death, as described in John 12:20\u201336 and John 13:21\u201338. (In the Tridentine Mass the Passion according to St. Mark is read instead.)\n*On Spy Wednesday, some observe the story of Judas arranging his betrayal of Jesus with the chief priests.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|26:14\u201325}}</ref> For this reason, the day is sometimes called [[Spy Wednesday]].<ref name=Cooper2013/> (In the Tridentine Mass the Passion according to St. Luke is read instead.)

This Mass was not included in editions of the Roman Missal before the time of Pope Pius XII.

As the [[Sabbath day]], the Gospel accounts all note that Jesus was hurriedly buried in a cave tomb after his crucifixion, with the intent to finish proper embalming and burial ceremonies on Sunday, after the Sabbath had ended, as the Sabbath day prohibitions would have prevented observant Jews from completing a proper burial.  While daytime liturgies or commemorations of the day are rare in the Western tradition, after sundown on Holy Saturday is the traditional time for [[Easter Vigil]].\n\nIn the Catholic tradition, Mass is not celebrated on what is liturgically Holy Saturday. The celebration of [[Easter]] begins after sundown on what, though still Saturday in the civil calendar, is liturgically Easter Sunday.\n{{Quote|On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.<br/>The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.<ref>Roman Missal, Holy Saturday</ref>}}\n\nIn some Anglican churches, including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], there is provision for a simple liturgy of the word with readings commemorating the burial of Christ.\n\nThe tabernacle is left empty and open.  The lamp or candle usually situated next to the tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the remaining [[Eucharist]]ic Hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday are kept elsewhere, usually the [[sacristy]], with a lamp or candle burning before it, so that, in cases of the danger of death, they may be given as ''[[viaticum]]''.\n\n===Easter Vigil===\n{{Main|Easter Vigil}}\n[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon holding the [[Paschal candle]] during the Easter Vigil]]\n\nThe name of the Easter Vigil, even if the [[vigil]] is held on what on the civil calendar is still Saturday, indicates that liturgically it is already Easter, no longer part of Holy Week, but still part of the Easter Triduum.\n\nIn the Anglican, Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian traditions, the Easter Vigil, one of the longest and most solemn of liturgical liturgies, lasts up to three or four hours, consists of four parts:<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\"/><ref name=\"Jr.2002\">{{cite book|title=Presbyterian Worship: A Guide for Clergy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNiHA25B2WQC&pg=PA102|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2002|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502188|page=102|quote=The Easter Vigil consists of four parts: the Service of Light, the service of Readings (the Word), the celebration of Baptism, and the celebration of the Lord's Supper.|author=J.

In the darkness (often in a side chapel of the church building or, preferably, outside the church), a new fire is kindled and blessed by the priest. This new fire symbolizes the light of salvation and hope that God brought into the world through Christ's Resurrection, dispelling the darkness of sin and death. From this fire is lit the [[Paschal candle]], symbolizing the Light of Christ. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the Church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \"light and life.\"\n\n[[File:Osternacht.jpg|thumb|250px|Candles lit for the Easter Vigil at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in Austria]]\nThe candles of those present are lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \"Light of Christ\" spreads throughout those gathered, the darkness is decreased. A deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, carries the Paschal Candle at the head of the entrance procession and, at three points, stops and chants the proclamation \"The Light of Christ\" (until Easter 2011, the official English text was \"Christ our Light\"), to which the people respond \"Thanks be to God.\" Once the procession concludes with the singing of the third proclamation, the lights throughout the church are lit, except for the altar candles. Then the deacon or a cantor chants the [[Exultet]] (also called the \"Easter Proclamation\"), After that, the people put aside their candles and sit down for the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Word includes between three and seven readings from the [[Old Testament]], followed by two from the New (an Epistle and a Gospel). The Old Testament readings must include the account in Exodus 14 of the crossing of the Red Sea, seen as an antitype of baptism and Christian salvation. Each Old Testament reading is followed by a psalm or canticle (such as Exodus 15:1\u201318 and a prayer relating what has been read to the Mystery of Christ. After the Old Testament readings conclude, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]], which has been suspended during Lent, is intoned and bells are rung\n\nA reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] is proclaimed. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since the beginning of Lent. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection then follows, along with a homily.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is blessed and any [[catechumen]]s or candidates for full communion are initiated into the church, by [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the sprinkling of [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The general intercessions follow.\n\nAfter the Liturgy of Baptism, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptised receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.\n\n===Easter Day===\n{{Main|Easter}}\nEaster Day, which immediately follows Holy Week and begins with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. It is the first day of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or [[Eastertide]], which runs from Easter Day to [[Pentecost]] Sunday. The Resurrection of Christ on Easter Day is the main reason why Christians keep every Sunday as the primary day of religious observance.\n\n===Holy Week observances===\n{{Liturgical year}}\nCities famous for their [[Holy Week procession]]s include:\n\n[[File:Holy Week procession Livngston.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy Week procession in [[Livingston, Guatemala]]]]\n[[File:LimaHolyWeek20050002.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy Monday Procession in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\t\n|-\n!Country\n!City\n|-\n| Colombia\n| [[Santa Cruz de Mompox]]<br/> [[Popay\u00e1n]]<br/> [[Tunja]]<br/> [[Pamplona, Colombia|Pamplona]]\n|-\n| Costa Rica\n| [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]<br/> [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]]<br/> [[Cartago, Costa Rica|San Rafael de Oreamuno]]\n|-\n| Guatemala\n| [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala]]<br/> [[Antigua Guatemala]]<br/> [[Guatemala City]]\n|-\n| Honduras\n| [[Comayagua]]<br/> [[Tegucigalpa]]\n|-\n| El Salvador\n| [[Sonsonate, El Salvador|Sonsonate]]\n|-\n| Indonesia\n| [[Larantuka]]\n|-\n| Mexico\n|[[Holy Week in Mexico]]<br/> [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]]\n|-\n| Nicaragua\n| [[Managua]]<br/> [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]<br/> [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]]\n|-\n| Philippines\n| [[Angono, Rizal]]<br/> [[Antipolo]]<br/> [[Baguio]] <br/> [[Good Friday processions in Baliuag|Baliuag, Bulacan]] <br/> [[Bantayan Island]] \nCebu City<br/> [[Capas, Tarlac]] <br/> [[Guagua, Pampanga]]<br/> [[Iloilo City]] <br/> [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] <br/> [[Oas, Albay]] <br/> [[Makati]]<br/> [[Manila]] <br/> [[Manaoag, Pangasinan]] <br/> [[Meycauayan]] <br/> [[Morong, Rizal]]  <br/> [[Naga, Camarines Sur]] <br/> [[Paete, Laguna]]<br/> [[Para\u00f1aque]] <br/> [[San Pablo, Laguna]] <br/> [[Santa Rita, Pampanga]] <br/> [[Sasmuan, Pampanga]]<br/> [[Vigan]]<br/> [[Taguig]] <br/> [[Las Pi\u00f1as]] <br/> [[Olongapo City]] <br/> [[Zambales]]\n|- \n| Peru\n| [[Ayacucho]]<br/> [[Cusco]]<br/> [[Huaraz]]<br/> [[Tarma]]\n|-\n| Spain\n| [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]<br/> [[Seville]]<br/> [[Valladolid]]<br/> [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]]<br/> [[Jerez de la Frontera]]<br/> [[Palencia]] <br/> [[M\u00e1laga]]<br/> [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]<br/> [[C\u00e1diz]]<br/> [[Murcia]]<br/> [[Alicante]]<br/> [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] <br/> [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]]\n|-\n| Venezuela \n| [[Tacarigua de Mamporal]]<br/>[[Guatire]]<br/> [[Caracas]]<br/> [[Villa de Cura]]\n|-\n| Vietnam\n| [[:vi:Tu\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh|Tu\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh]]\n|}\n\n==== Brazil ====\n[[File:Igreja Santo Ant\u00f4nio, Florian\u00f3polis, Brasil 000.JPG|thumb|250px|A church in [[Florian\u00f3polis]], Brazil, preparated for the Good Friday celebrations.]]\nHoly Week has developed into one of Brazil's main symbols of community identity, more specifically in the southern town of Campanha. The Campanha Holy Week begins on the Monday evening with the Procession of the Deposit. The figure of Our Lord of the Stations, representing the blood-stained Jesus carrying the cross, is brought from the church in a large black box and displayed in the main square. Then it is solemnly taken to the church following a band and a procession of people. Outside the church, a sermon is delivered on the Easter story of Jesus' death and resurrection. After the sermon, a choir inside the open doors of the church sings the [[Psalm 51|Miserere]] by Manoel Dias de Oliveria, while the black box is brought inside the church, and people come in to kiss the human-sized figure of Christ. Processions on Tuesday and Wednesday stop at different chapels at each of which a large painting portrays episodes of the Way of the Cross and a related hymn is sung at each. On Thursday morning the Chrism Mass is celebrated, with a blessing of the oils. Good Friday afternoon ceremonies are followed by the week's main spectacle of the Taking Down from the Cross in front of the cathedral followed by the Funeral Procession of Our Dead Lord. The drama shows Christ being taken from the cross and placed in a coffin, which is then taken around to the accompaniment of the \"Song of Veronica\". On Saturday morning a drama is performed by the youth. The following night, the Paschal Vigil is celebrated, and the streets are transformed into a beautiful array of intricate, colorful carpets to prepare for the following day. Easter Sunday begins before sunrise with the singing of the choir and band performances to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Bells and fireworks are followed by a Mass that ends with the \"Hallelujah Chorus\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ribeiro|first=Patricia|title=Easter in Brazil|url=http://gobrazil.about.com/od/festivalsevents/p/brazholyweek.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Reily|first=Suzel Ana |title=Remembering the Baroque Era: Historical Consciousness, Local Identity and the Holy Week Celebrations in a Former Mining Town in Brazil |journal=Ethnomusicology Forum|date=June 2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39\u201362|jstor=20184539}}</ref>\n\n==== Guatemala ====\nHoly Week in Guatemala incorporates processions with images of saints carried on huge wooden platforms. The heavy ''andas'' are held by the locals, both men and women, who are frequently in purple robes. The procession is led by a man holding a container of incense accompanied by a small horn and flute band. Intricate carpets (''alfombras'') line the streets during the week's celebration. Easter processions begin at sunrise and everyone comes to join the festivities.\n\nIn Amatenango, the figure of Judas, who betrayed Christ has been the main point of focus during the Mayan Holy Week. The priest calls Judas the \"killer of Christ\".  The figure used to be beaten after the Crucifixion performance on Good Friday, but is now treated more calmly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|title=Guatemala: a Journey Through the Land of the Maya|year=2008|publisher=Purple Moon Publications; 1st edition|isbn=9780615210582}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=June|title=Judas Transformed [Maya, Holy Week]|journal=Natural History|year=1994|volume=103|issue=3}}</ref>\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:Addolorata3.JPG|thumb|250px|Addolorata procession, [[Polistena]], [[Italy]]]]\nHoly Week is also observed in parts of Southern Italy, notably Sicily. The most famous is the Holy Week of [[Trapani]], culminating in the [[Processione dei Misteri di Trapani]] or simply the ''Misteri di Trapani'' (in English the ''Procession of the Mysteries of Trapani'' or the ''Mysteries of Trapani''), a day-long passion procession featuring twenty floats of lifelike wood, canvas and glue sculptures of individual scenes of the events of the Passion.\n\nThe Misteri are amongst the oldest continuously running religious events in Europe, having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612, and running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours; they are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy. Similar but smaller or shorter passion processions are held in many other Sicilian cities, like [[Erice]] and [[Caltanissetta]], but also in various Southern Italian cities, like [[Salerno]] and [[Taranto]].\n\n====Malta====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Malta}}\nThe Holy Week commemorations reach their paramount on Good Friday as the Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities. The Cross follows a significant Way of Jesus. Good Friday processions take place in [[Birgu]], [[Bormla]], [[G\u0127axaq]], [[Luqa]], [[Mosta]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qormi]], [[Rabat]], [[Senglea]], [[Valletta]], [[\u017bebbu\u0121, Malta|\u017bebbu\u0121]] and [[\u017bejtun]].

The rituals date back to the early seventeenth century, at the time of pioneering [[Jesuit]] priest.<ref name=\"rimjournal\" /> The major event of the Yaqui Indians during Holy Week occurs on Wednesday evening in which people arrive at the church on horseback and begin to crawl and dance naked on the floor. Light begins to go out and people beguin the whipping, screaming and crying to the sound of traditional music of sacrifice. In [[Tucson]], dancers are used to wear dark coats and black hide masks, instead of blankets.<ref name=\"rimjournal\">{{cite web|url= http://www.rimjournal.com/arizyson/easter.htm/|title= Yaqui and Mayo Indian Easter ceremonies}}</ref>\n\nChildren in white robes with blue painted faces and a dark hooded figure, symbolizing the betrayer of Christ, join the Thursday morning procession to the church. There they promise to serve God for the next three or five years, until their eyes start to bleed just like Christ's would. That night, there is a symbolic search for Jesus when the \"Pharisees\" visit various crosses in the streets and capture the \"old man\" (symbolic Jesus). On Friday \na member of the church who volunteers to represent Jesus is beaten and buried for two days.

Most stores are closed and most people in the cities return to their home provinces to commemorate Holy Week in their home town.\n\nHoly Week is commemorated with street processions featuring wheeled ''carrozas'' or floats carrying various icons, the [[Way of the Cross]], and a [[Passion play]] called the ''Sen\u00e1kulo''. In some communities (most famously in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]]), the processions include devotees who self-flagellate and sometimes even have themselves nailed to crosses as expressions of penance. After 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] on Good Friday (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), noise is discouraged, many [[radio|radio stations]] and [[television|television stations]] [[closedown|close down]] (some broadcast religious programming, with non-Catholic owned stations continuing broadcast), and the faithful are urged to keep a solemn and prayerful disposition through to [[Easter]] Sunday.\n\nAt [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on [[Palm Sunday]], Catholics carry \"palasp\u00e1s\" or palm leaves to be blessed by the priest.  Many Filipinos bring home the palm leaves after the Mass and place these above their front doors or their windows, believing that doing so can ward off evil spirits. Holy Monday marks the beginning of the ''Pabasa'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], \"reading\"), the marathon chanting of the [[Pasyon|Pasy\u00f3n]], a [[poem]] narrating Jesus' life and death. The chanting, which continues day and night without interruption, lasts as long as two straight days.\n\nOne of the most important Holy Week traditions in the Philippines is the ''[[Seven Churches Visitation|Visita Iglesia]]'' (Spanish for \"church visit\").<ref name=PhilStar2015>{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=IN PHOTOS: A look at churches where Pinoys spend Visita Iglesia|url=http://www.philstar.com/travel-and-tourism/2015/04/02/1440184/photos-look-churches-where-pinoys-spend-visita-iglesia|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=philstar.com|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=2 April 2015}}</ref> On Maundy Thursday, the faithful visit seven churches to pray the [[Stations of the Cross]], and in the evenings, pray in front of each church's Altar of Repose.<ref name=GMA2015>{{cite news|last1=Bartolome|first1=Jessica|title=Doing the Visita Iglesia in Metro Manila|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/463006/lifestyle/artandculture/map-doing-the-visita-iglesia-in-metro-manila|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=GMA News|date=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe last Mass before [[Easter]] is also celebrated on Maundy Thursday, usually including a reenactment of the [[Washing of the Feet]] of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. This Mass is followed by the procession of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] to be transferred to the [[Altar of Repose]]. [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the commemoration of Jesus' [[Seven last words]] (Siete Palabras) and a Passion play called the [[Passion play|Sinakulo]].\n\nEaster Day is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn ''[[Salubong]]'' rite, wherein statues of Jesus and Mary are brought in procession together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' [[Resurrection]]. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass. Most Catholic communities across the Philippines practice this, though it is more popularly celebrated in the provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/254165/lifestyle/artandculture/easter-salubong-rooted-in-culture-family-ties|title=Easter Salubong: Rooted in culture, family ties|website=GMA News Online|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> The rite, originally called the ''encuentro'', was introduced by Spanish priests during the colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/382513/faithful-rejoice-at-salubong|title=Faithful rejoice at 'salubong'|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Spain}}\n[[File:Carroza de la visi\u00f3n de San Juan, conocida como \"la bola\", Paso Blanco, Semana Santa Lorca.jpg|thumb|Holy week in [[Lorca, Spain]]]]\n\n[[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba,_Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Murcia]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]], [[Palencia]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] or [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] hold elaborate processions for Holy Week. A tradition dating from [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] that has spread to other cities in [[Andalusia]], the ''\"Semana Santa en Sevilla\"'' is notable for featuring the procession of '''\"pasos\"''', lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus's arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son. Holy week processions in Seville include marching bands that escort the pasos.<ref>Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/spain-marches-and-saetas-accompany-holy-week-processions \"In Seville Marches And Saetas Accompany Holy Week Processions\"], ''Catholics & Cultures'' updated 27 June 2018</ref>\n\nIn M\u00e1laga, the lifelike wooden or plaster sculptures are called \"tronos\" and they are carried through the streets by \"costaleros\" ( Translated literally as \"sack men\", because of the ''costal'', a sack-like cloth that they wear over their neck, to soften the burden). These pasos and tronos are physically carried on their necks or \"braceros\" (this name is popular in Leon). The paso can weigh up to five metric tonnes. In front of them walk the penitentes, dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles for up to 11 hours. The pasos are set up and maintained by ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'', religious brotherhoods that are common to a specific area of the city, whose precede the paso dressed in Roman military costumes or penitential robes.\n\nThose members who wish to do so wear these penitential robes with conical hats, or ''[[capirotes]]'', used to conceal the face of the wearer. These \"Nazarenos\" or \"Papones\" (this word is typical from Leon) carry processional candles, may walk the city streets barefoot, and may carry shackles and chains in their feet as penance. A brass band, marching band, a drum and bugle band, or in the cases of [[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]] and M\u00e1laga a military band (such as that of the [[Spanish Legion]] or other military units) may accompany the group, playing funeral marches, hymns or \"marchas\" written for the occasion.\n\n===Music===\n{{listen\n | filename    = Tomas Luis de Victoria O vos omnes (The Tudor Consort).ogg\n | title       = Fifth responsory for Holy Saturday\n | description = [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''[[O vos omnes]]'' performed live by [[The Tudor Consort]] (2003)\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nMusic for the Holy Week includes [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]], [[Responsories for Holy Week]], [[Passion oratorio]]s and [[Easter oratorio]]s.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae'' (1585) contains settings of 37 texts for the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the Holy Week. [[Carlo Gesualdo]]'s ''[[Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia]]'' (1611) contains settings of all 27 [[Tenebrae]] responsories (for [[matins]] of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday), and of a few other text for use in [[lauds]] of the Holy Week. ''[[Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres]]'' as composed by various French baroque composers were usually intended for performance during the evening of [[Holy Wednesday]], Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.\n\n==Holy Week in Eastern Christianity==\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nIn the [[Orthodox Church]], the forty days of [[Great Lent]] end on the Friday before Palm Sunday. The two days that follow, [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]], form a transition to Holy Week, neither in Lent nor in Holy Week themselves, but in combination with Holy Week containing the continuing observances in preparation for [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter), during which the faithful continue to fast.\n\nLazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' [[Raising of Lazarus|raising]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, just before he went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes anticipate the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, [[caviar]]), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday is considered one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday [[Canonical hours|liturgies]] are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday liturgy.\n\nHoly Week is referred to as \"Great and Holy Week\", or \"Passion Week\".<ref>Triodion (standard Orthodox service book)</ref> Since the Orthodox liturgical day starts at sunset (as it has from antiquity), Holy Monday liturgies begin Sunday evening, at the normal timing for Monday Vespers (Vespers is the first liturgy of the day). However, during Holy Week, in most parishes, many liturgy times are advanced from six to twelve hours in time and celebrated in anticipation, which permits more of the faithful to attend the most prominent liturgies. Thus, it is the [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|matins]] liturgy of Great Monday that is on \"Palm Sunday\" evening in parish churches and often [[vespers]] is in the morning.\n\n[[Fasting]] during Great and Holy Week is very strict, as in Lent at a minimum: dairy products and meat products are strictly forbidden, and on most days, no alcoholic beverages are permitted and no oil is used in cooking.  Holy Friday and Holy Saturday especially may exceed Lenten norms. Those who can, including monastics, observe them as days of abstention, meaning that nothing is eaten on those days. However, fasting is always adjusted to the needs of the individual, and those who are very young, ill or elderly are not expected to fast as strictly. Those who are able may receive the blessing of their [[spiritual father]] to observe an even stricter fast, whereby they eat only two meals that week: one on Wednesday night and one after [[Divine Liturgy]] on Thursday.\n\n====Great and Holy Monday through Wednesday====\n{{Main|Holy Monday|Holy Tuesday|Holy Wednesday}}\n[[File:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ the Bridegroom, sitting above the star at [[Golgotha]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nA new liturgical day beginning at sunset, the first liturgy of each day is [[vespers]] at which [[sticheron|stichera]] are chanted elaborating the theme of the new day.\n\nThese days' Orthros liturgies (which in parishes is performed the previous night) are often referred to as the \"Bridegroom Prayer\", because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the [[troparion]] that is solemnly chanted during them. On these days, an [[icon]] of the \"Bridegroom\" is placed on an [[analogion]] in the center of the [[temple]], portraying Jesus wearing the purple [[robe]] of mockery and crowned with a [[crown of thorns]] (see [[Instruments of the Passion]]).\n\nThe same theme is repeated in the [[exapostilarion]], a hymn which occurs near the end of the liturgy. These liturgies follow much the same pattern as liturgies on weekdays of [[Great Lent]]. The liturgies are so laid out that the entire [[Psalter]] (with the exception of [[Kathisma]] XVII) is chanted on the first three days of Holy Week. The [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] that is chanted on these days is a \"Triode\", i.e., composed of three [[ode]]s instead of the usual nine, as is in other weekday liturgies in the [[Triodion]].\n\nTowards the end of the Tuesday evening Bridegroom liturgy (Orthros for Great and Holy Wednesday), the ''[[Kassia|Hymn of Kassiani]]'' is sung. The [[hymn]], (written in the 9th century by [[Kassia]]) tells of the woman who washed Christ's feet in the house of [[Simon the Pharisee]].<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|7:36\u201350}}</ref> Much of the hymn is written from the perspective of the sinful woman:\n\n<blockquote>O Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, sensing Your Divinity, takes upon herself the duty of a myrrh-bearer. With lamentations she brings you myrrh in anticipation of your entombment. \"Woe to me!\" she cries, \"for me night has become a frenzy of licentiousness, a dark and moonless love of sin. Receive the fountain of my tears, O You who gathers into clouds the waters of the sea. Incline unto me,  unto the sighings of my heart, O You who bowed the heavens by your ineffable condescension. I will wash your immaculate feet with kisses and dry them again with the tresses of my hair; those very feet at whose sound Eve hid herself from in fear when she heard You walking in Paradise in the twilight of the day. As for the multitude of my sins and the depths of Your judgments, who can search them out, O Savior of souls, my Savior? Do not disdain me Your handmaiden, O You who are boundless in mercy.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn vespers at the end of Monday through Wednesday is a reading from the Gospel which sets forth the new day's theme and then the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] may be celebrated.\n\nThe Byzantine musical composition expresses the poetry so strongly that it leaves many people in a state of prayerful tears. The Hymn can last upwards of 25 minutes and is liturgically and musically a highpoint of the entire year.\n\n====Great and Holy Thursday====\n{{Main|Holy Thursday}}\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\n\nIn many churches, especially Greek Orthodox, a liturgy of [[Anointing]] ([[Holy Unction]]) is held on Wednesday evening, following the Presanctified Liturgy. This is in commemoration of the [[anointing of Jesus]], and a preparation of the faithful to enter with Christ into his death and Resurrection. Those who wish to receive [[Holy Communion]] on Great and Holy Thursday, are encouraged to receive the [[Holy Mystery]] of Unction.\n\nOrthros of Great and Holy Thursday does not follow the format of Great Lent (with the singular exception of chanting [[Alleluia]] in place of [[God is the Lord]]), but is celebrated as outside Lent, having a complete canon. Also, beginning at this liturgy there will be no more reading of the psalter for the rest of Holy Week, with the exception of [[kathisma]] XVII at Orthros of Great and Holy Saturday.\n\nDivine Liturgy of the [[Last Supper]] is held on the morning of Great and Holy Thursday, combining Vespers with the [[Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great]]. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the [[Holy Table]] (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and [[monastery|monasteries]] it is customary for the [[bishop]] or [[hegumen]] (abbot) to celebrate the [[Washing of Feet]]. When it is necessary for an [[autocephalous]] church to consecrate more [[chrysm]] the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of that church will consecrate it at this Liturgy.\n\nGreat and Holy Thursday is the only day during Holy Week when those observing the strict tradition will eat a cooked meal, though they will not do so until after the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the Liturgy. At this meal wine and oil are permitted, but the faithful still abstain from meat and dairy products.\n\n====Great and Holy Friday====\n{{Main|Good Friday}}\nMatins of Great and Holy Friday is celebrated on the evening of Holy Thursday. During this liturgy, twelve [[Matins Gospel]]s are chanted, from which this liturgy derives its name of \"Matins of the Twelve Gospels\".  These Gospel lessons recount in chronological order the events from the Last Supper though the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]] of Jesus. At one point, when we reach the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large [[crucifix|cross]] with an [[icon]] the crucified Christ attached to it, and places it in the center of the [[nave]] for all the faithful to venerate. This cross will remain in the center of the church until the bringing out of the [[epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] the next evening.\n\nOn Great and Holy Friday morning the [[Royal Hours]] are served. These are a solemn celebration of the [[Little Hours]] with added hymns and readings.\n\n[[File:Hautausikoni.jpg|thumb|250px|The Epitaphios (Plashchanitza) placed in the [[nave]] of the church for the faithful to venerate. The [[Gospel Book]] rests in the center.]]\n\nVespers of Great and Holy Friday (Vespers of the [[Deposition from the Cross]]) is held in the morning or early afternoon of Great and Holy Friday. The figure of Christ is taken down from the Cross, and a richly embroidered cloth icon called the ''[[Epitaphios (liturgy)|Epitaphios]]'' ([[Church Slavonic]]: ''Plashchanitza'') depicting Christ prepared for burial is laid in a \"[[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]]\" decorated with flowers. At the end of the liturgy all come forward to venerate the Epitaphios.\n\n[[Compline]] of Great and Holy Friday contains a Canon of Lamentations of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]).\n\n====Great and Holy Saturday====\n{{Main|Holy Saturday}}\n[[File:Epitaphios Procession Beginning at Great Saturday Mattins.jpg|thumb|250px|Beginning of the epitaphios procession at Great Saturday Mattins]]\n\nMatins of Great and Holy Saturday is, in parish practice, held on Friday evening. The liturgy is known as the \"Orthros of [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Lamentations at the Tomb]]\", because the majority of the liturgy is composed of the clergy and faithful gathered around the tomb, chanting the \"Lamentations\" interspersed between the verses of Kathisma XVII ([[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]]). At a certain point the priest sprinkles the tomb with rose petals and [[rose water]]. Near the end of the liturgy, the Epitaphios is carried in a candlelit procession around the outside of the church as the faithful sing the [[Trisagion]].\n\n[[Vespers]] joined to the [[Divine Liturgy]] is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning.  This is the ''Proti Anastasi'' (First Resurrection) liturgy, commemorating the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the liturgy changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the [[Paschal kiss]], since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\nIf there are [[catechumens]] who are prepared for [[baptism]] they are baptized and [[chrismation|chrismated]] during the Old Testament readings.\n\n[[File:Receiving the Holy Light at Easter.jpg|thumb|250px|People receiving the Holy Light at Easter from Father Diogenis at St George Greek Orthodox Church [[Adelaide]]]]\n\nOn Saturday night, the [[Paschal Vigil]] begins around 11:00&nbsp;pm with the chanting of the [[Midnight Office]]. Afterwards, all of the lighting in the church is extinguished and all remain in silence and darkness until the stroke of midnight. Then, the priest lights a single candle from the [[eternal flame]] on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread from person to person until everyone holds a lighted candle.\n\nA procession then circles around the outside of the church, recreating the journey of the [[Myrrh Bearers]] as they journeyed to the [[Tomb of Jesus]] on the first Easter morning. The procession stops in front of the closed doors of the church. The opening of these doors symbolized the \"rolling away of the stone\" from the tomb by the angel, and all enter the church joyfully singing the [[Troparion]] of [[Easter|Pascha]]. Paschal Orthros begins with an [[Ektenia]] (litany) and the chanting of the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]].\n\nOne of the highpoints is the sharing of the [[paschal kiss]] and the reading of the ''[[Paschal Homily|Hieratikon]]'' ([[Catechism|Catechetical]] [[Homily]] of [[John Chrysostom]]) by the priest. The Divine Liturgy follows, and every Orthodox Christian is encouraged to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] on this holiest day of the year. A [[breakfast]] usually follows, sometimes lasting till dawn. Slavs bring [[Easter basket]]s filled with eggs, meat, butter, and cheese\u2014foods from which the faithful have abstained during [[Great Lent]]\u2014to be blessed by the priest which are then taken back home to be shared by family and friends with joy.\n\nOn the afternoon of Easter Day, a joyful liturgy called \"[[Agape feast|Agape]] Vespers\" is celebrated. During this liturgy, the [[Prokeimenon|Great Prokeimenon]] is chanted and a lesson from the Gospel<ref>{{bibleref2|John|20:19\u201325}}</ref> is read in as many different languages as possible, accompanied by the joyful ringing of bells.\n\n===Coptic Orthodox Church===\nThe Coptic Orthodox Christians fast the Lent for 55 days including the Holy Week which they call Holy Paschal Week.<ref>http://www.zeitun-eg.org/paschag2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Friday before Palm Sunday is called \"The Concluding Friday of Great Lent\". On this day a special liturgy called \"The Unction of the Sick\" is conducted. It consists of seven prayers and at the conclusion of the prayers, the priest anoints each member of the congregation with the holy oil.\n\nThe following day \u2013 the last Saturday before Holy Week \u2013 is called \"Lazarus' Saturday\". On this day the Coptic Church commemorates [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], the brother of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]]. This day is related to the events of Holy Week in that John 12 tells of a visit of Jesus to Lazarus immediately before recounting the events of Palm Sunday.\n\nSince the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\nThroughout Holy Week, a paschal liturgy is conducted each evening, starting on Sunday night (the eve of Monday), and every morning, up until Easter. These paschal liturgies take place in the middle of the church, not on the altar, because Jesus suffered and was crucified on Golgotha, outside of Jerusalem. The altar is bared of all its coverings and relics.\n\nEach day liturgy is divided into 5 \"hours\"; The First Hour, The Third Hour, The Sixth Hour, The Ninth Hour, and The Eleventh Hour.\nLikewise, each night liturgy is also divided into the same five hours. However, Good Friday has an extra hour added to it, that of The Twelfth Hour.\nDuring each hour, one prophecy is read at the beginning, a hymn is chanted twelve times, a psalm is sung in a sad tune, one passage from a gospel is read, and an exposition concludes the hour.\nDuring the eve of Friday, four gospel passages are read, and more prophecies are read as well.\nFrom Tuesday night onward, the people do not greet each other nor the priests, and do not even kiss the icons of saints in the church, because it was with a kiss that Judas betrayed Jesus.\n\nOn Thursday of Holy Week, also called Covenant Thursday, a liturgy is prayed and communion is given to symbolize the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus. Also, before the liturgy the priests wash the feet of the congregation in imitation of Jesus washing his disciples' feet.\n\nLate Friday night until early Saturday morning is called Apocalypse Night. During this night, another liturgy is prayed and the entire [[Book of the Apocalypse]] is read, to symbolize the [[Second Coming]].\n\nThe series concludes with the Easter liturgy on Saturday night, followed by a gathering in the church where the participants can celebrate the joy of the resurrection, eating together and ending their long fast, and at which they are permitted once again to partake of meat, fish, and dairy products.\n\n===Eastern Catholic Churches===\nEastern Catholic Churches' Holy Week observances and customs are generally the same as in the rites of the corresponding Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Church or Assyrian Church of the East.\n\n==Related observances==\n===Friday of Sorrows===\n{{Main|Friday of Sorrows}}\nThe religious processions that are part of the Holy Week celebrations in many countries begin two days before Holy Week on what in those countries is called Friday of Sorrows.\n\nOn the Friday before Holy Week, the [[Roman Rite]] celebrated universally from 1727 to 1969 a liturgical feast of the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]]. Celebration of this feast began in Germany but spread to many other countries even before [[Pope Benedict XIII]] made it a universal feast, assigning it to the Friday before Palm Sunday. Another feast with the same name was and still is celebrated in September.<ref>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|no-icon=1|prescript=|first=Frederick|last=Holweck|wstitle=Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary}}</ref> With his [[Code of Rubrics]] of 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] reduced the feast on the Friday of what was then called Passion Week (the week before Holy Week) to the level of a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]], and in 1969 the celebration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] as a duplicate of the September feast.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 2002 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] provides an alternative [[collect]] for this Friday:<ref>Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nO God, who in this season\ngive your Church the grace\nto imitate devoutly the Blessed Virgin Mary\nin contemplating the Passion of Christ,\ngrant, we pray, through her intercession,\nthat we may cling more firmly each day\nto your Only Begotten Son\nand come at last to the fullness of his grace.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis provision of an alternative collect was the equivalent of granting the Lenten celebration of Our Lady of Sorrow the rank of [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]], since during Lent a memorial, even if otherwise obligatory, is represented in the liturgy of the day at most by optional use of its collect.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20030317_ordinamento-messale_en.html General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355] and [https://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/Info/GNLY.pdf Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar, 14]</ref> The liturgical calendar of [[Malta]] gives the celebration the rank of feast, making its observance obligatory. Observance of the Tridentine Mass calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', giving Our Lady of Sorrows a [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] within the liturgy of the Friday.\n\nIn many [[Latin American]] countries, such as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Peru]], as well as in [[Spain]] and the Philippines, this Friday feast of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is called ''Viernes de Dolores'' ([[Friday of Sorrows]]). It is sometimes also referred to as \"Council Friday\", because of the choice of John 11:47\u201354 as the Gospel passage read in the [[Tridentine Mass]] on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the meeting of the [[Sanhedrin]] to discuss what to do with Jesus.

The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the [[Apostolical Constitutions]] (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an [[Black Fast|absolute fast]] is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.<ref>Apostolical Constitutions v. 18, 19</ref>\n\nThere is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding [[Easter Day]], and also for the seven which followed it. The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.).\n\nOf the particular days of the \"great week\" the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally Good Friday. Next came the ''Sabbatum Magnum'' (\"Great Sabbath\", i.e., [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve) with its [[Paschal vigil|vigil]], which in the [[early church]] was associated with an expectation that the [[second advent]] would occur on an Easter Day.\n\nOther writings that refer to related traditions of the early Church include, most notably, ''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'' (also known as ''The Pilgrimage of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]]''), which details the whole observance of Holy Week at that time.\n\nToday, in the [[Western Christian Church]], among Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Catholics, the liturgies used for Holy Week are nearly identical.<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\">{{cite book|last=Ramshaw|first=Gail|title=The Three-Day Feast: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbb9axN6qFwC&pg=PA7|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2004|publisher=Augsburg Books|quote=Many Christians are already familiar with the ancient, and now recently restored, liturgies of the Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the great Easter Vigil service of light, readings, baptism, and communion.

Traditionally, Palm Sunday commemorates the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] described in all four [[canonical gospel]]s.  As described in the accounts, Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was noted by the crowds present who shouted praises and waved [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]]. In the Roman Rite, before 1955 it was known simply as Palm Sunday, and the preceding Sunday as Passion Sunday. From 1955 to 1971 it was called Second Sunday in [[Passiontide]] or Palm Sunday. Among Lutherans and Anglicans, the day is known as the Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday.<ref name=\"Bower2003\">{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Peter C.|title=The Companion to the Book of Common Worship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWqm3hCMC0C&pg=PA111|accessdate=13 April 2014|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502324|page=111|quote=Presbyterians, Methodists, and Roman Catholics call this day Passion/Palm Sunday; the United Church of Christ calls it Palm/Passion Sunday; Lutherans and Episcopalians call it The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday.}}</ref>\n\nIn many liturgical denominations, to commemorate the Messiah's entry into [[Jerusalem]] to accomplish his [[paschal mystery]], it is customary to have a blessing of [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]] (or other branches, for example olive branches). The blessing ceremony includes the reading of a Gospel account of how Jesus rode into Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, reminiscent of a Davidic victory procession, and how people placed palms and other branches on the ground in front of him. Immediately following this great time of celebration over the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, he begins his journey to the cross. The blessing is thus followed by a procession or solemn entrance into the church, with the participants holding the blessed branches in their hands. The Mass or liturgy of worship itself includes a reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the narrative of Jesus' capture, sufferings and death, as recounted in one of the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. (In the [[Tridentine Mass]] the Passion narrative read on this day is always that of St. Matthew.)\n\nBefore the reform of the rite by [[Pope Pius XII]], the blessing of the palms occurred inside the church within a liturgy that followed the general outline of a Mass, with Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as far as the Sanctus. The palms were then blessed with five prayers, and a procession went out of the church and on its return included a ceremony for the reopening of the doors, which had meantime been shut. After this the normal Mass was celebrated.<ref name=prePXII>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal]</ref>\n\n===Holy Monday to Spy Wednesday===\n[[File:Catholic_Tenebrae_service.jpg|thumb|left|A Tenebrae liturgy held at a Roman Catholic parish church on Spy Wednesday (2019)]]\nThe days between Palm Sunday and Holy Thursday are known as [[Holy Monday]], [[Holy Tuesday]], and [[Spy Wednesday]] (Holy Wednesday).  The Gospel accounts are not always clear or in agreement on the events which occurred on these days, though there are traditional observances held by some denominations to commemorate certain events from the last days of Jesus' life.  Among them\n\n* On Holy Monday, some observe the anointing of Jesus at Bethany,<ref>{{bibleref2|John|12:1\u201311}}</ref> an event that in the Gospel of John occurred before the Palm Sunday event described in John 12:12\u201319.  Other events which the Gospels tell of which may have occurred on this day include [[cursing the fig tree]] and the [[Cleansing of the Temple]].\n* On Holy Tuesday, some observe Jesus' predictions of his own death, as described in John 12:20\u201336 and John 13:21\u201338. (In the Tridentine Mass the Passion according to St. Mark is read instead.)\n*On Spy Wednesday, some observe the story of Judas arranging his betrayal of Jesus with the chief priests.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|26:14\u201325}}</ref> For this reason, the day is sometimes called [[Spy Wednesday]].<ref name=Cooper2013/> (In the Tridentine Mass the Passion according to St. Luke is read instead.)

The service was introduced into the Church of England in the 1860s and was for a time widely observed in Anglican and Lutheran and some Catholic churches.

As the [[Sabbath day]], the Gospel accounts all note that Jesus was hurriedly buried in a cave tomb after his crucifixion, with the intent to finish proper embalming and burial ceremonies on Sunday, after the Sabbath had ended, as the Sabbath day prohibitions would have prevented observant Jews from completing a proper burial.  While daytime liturgies or commemorations of the day are rare in the Western tradition, after sundown on Holy Saturday is the traditional time for [[Easter Vigil]].\n\nIn the Catholic tradition, Mass is not celebrated on what is liturgically Holy Saturday. The celebration of [[Easter]] begins after sundown on what, though still Saturday in the civil calendar, is liturgically Easter Sunday.\n{{Quote|On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.<br/>The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.<ref>Roman Missal, Holy Saturday</ref>}}\n\nIn some Anglican churches, including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], there is provision for a simple liturgy of the word with readings commemorating the burial of Christ.\n\nThe tabernacle is left empty and open.  The lamp or candle usually situated next to the tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the remaining [[Eucharist]]ic Hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday are kept elsewhere, usually the [[sacristy]], with a lamp or candle burning before it, so that, in cases of the danger of death, they may be given as ''[[viaticum]]''.\n\n===Easter Vigil===\n{{Main|Easter Vigil}}\n[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon holding the [[Paschal candle]] during the Easter Vigil]]\n\nThe name of the Easter Vigil, even if the [[vigil]] is held on what on the civil calendar is still Saturday, indicates that liturgically it is already Easter, no longer part of Holy Week, but still part of the Easter Triduum.\n\nIn the Anglican, Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian traditions, the Easter Vigil, one of the longest and most solemn of liturgical liturgies, lasts up to three or four hours, consists of four parts:<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\"/><ref name=\"Jr.2002\">{{cite book|title=Presbyterian Worship: A Guide for Clergy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNiHA25B2WQC&pg=PA102|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2002|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502188|page=102|quote=The Easter Vigil consists of four parts: the Service of Light, the service of Readings (the Word), the celebration of Baptism, and the celebration of the Lord's Supper.|author=J.

In the darkness (often in a side chapel of the church building or, preferably, outside the church), a new fire is kindled and blessed by the priest. This new fire symbolizes the light of salvation and hope that God brought into the world through Christ's Resurrection, dispelling the darkness of sin and death. From this fire is lit the [[Paschal candle]], symbolizing the Light of Christ. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the Church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \"light and life.\"\n\n[[File:Osternacht.jpg|thumb|250px|Candles lit for the Easter Vigil at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in Austria]]\nThe candles of those present are lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \"Light of Christ\" spreads throughout those gathered, the darkness is decreased. A deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, carries the Paschal Candle at the head of the entrance procession and, at three points, stops and chants the proclamation \"The Light of Christ\" (until Easter 2011, the official English text was \"Christ our Light\"), to which the people respond \"Thanks be to God.\" Once the procession concludes with the singing of the third proclamation, the lights throughout the church are lit, except for the altar candles. Then the deacon or a cantor chants the [[Exultet]] (also called the \"Easter Proclamation\"), After that, the people put aside their candles and sit down for the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Word includes between three and seven readings from the [[Old Testament]], followed by two from the New (an Epistle and a Gospel). The Old Testament readings must include the account in Exodus 14 of the crossing of the Red Sea, seen as an antitype of baptism and Christian salvation. Each Old Testament reading is followed by a psalm or canticle (such as Exodus 15:1\u201318 and a prayer relating what has been read to the Mystery of Christ. After the Old Testament readings conclude, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]], which has been suspended during Lent, is intoned and bells are rung\n\nA reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] is proclaimed. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since the beginning of Lent. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection then follows, along with a homily.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is blessed and any [[catechumen]]s or candidates for full communion are initiated into the church, by [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the sprinkling of [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The general intercessions follow.\n\nAfter the Liturgy of Baptism, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptised receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.\n\n===Easter Day===\n{{Main|Easter}}\nEaster Day, which immediately follows Holy Week and begins with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. It is the first day of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or [[Eastertide]], which runs from Easter Day to [[Pentecost]] Sunday. The Resurrection of Christ on Easter Day is the main reason why Christians keep every Sunday as the primary day of religious observance.\n\n===Holy Week observances===\n{{Liturgical year}}\nCities famous for their [[Holy Week procession]]s include:\n\n[[File:Holy Week procession Livngston.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy Week procession in [[Livingston, Guatemala]]]]\n[[File:LimaHolyWeek20050002.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy Monday Procession in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\t\n|-\n!Country\n!City\n|-\n| Colombia\n| [[Santa Cruz de Mompox]]<br/> [[Popay\u00e1n]]<br/> [[Tunja]]<br/> [[Pamplona, Colombia|Pamplona]]\n|-\n| Costa Rica\n| [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]<br/> [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]]<br/> [[Cartago, Costa Rica|San Rafael de Oreamuno]]\n|-\n| Guatemala\n| [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala]]<br/> [[Antigua Guatemala]]<br/> [[Guatemala City]]\n|-\n| Honduras\n| [[Comayagua]]<br/> [[Tegucigalpa]]\n|-\n| El Salvador\n| [[Sonsonate, El Salvador|Sonsonate]]\n|-\n| Indonesia\n| [[Larantuka]]\n|-\n| Mexico\n|[[Holy Week in Mexico]]<br/> [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]]\n|-\n| Nicaragua\n| [[Managua]]<br/> [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]<br/> [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]]\n|-\n| Philippines\n| [[Angono, Rizal]]<br/> [[Antipolo]]<br/> [[Baguio]] <br/> [[Good Friday processions in Baliuag|Baliuag, Bulacan]] <br/> [[Bantayan Island]] \nCebu City<br/> [[Capas, Tarlac]] <br/> [[Guagua, Pampanga]]<br/> [[Iloilo City]] <br/> [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] <br/> [[Oas, Albay]] <br/> [[Makati]]<br/> [[Manila]] <br/> [[Manaoag, Pangasinan]] <br/> [[Meycauayan]] <br/> [[Morong, Rizal]]  <br/> [[Naga, Camarines Sur]] <br/> [[Paete, Laguna]]<br/> [[Para\u00f1aque]] <br/> [[San Pablo, Laguna]] <br/> [[Santa Rita, Pampanga]] <br/> [[Sasmuan, Pampanga]]<br/> [[Vigan]]<br/> [[Taguig]] <br/> [[Las Pi\u00f1as]] <br/> [[Olongapo City]] <br/> [[Zambales]]\n|- \n| Peru\n| [[Ayacucho]]<br/> [[Cusco]]<br/> [[Huaraz]]<br/> [[Tarma]]\n|-\n| Spain\n| [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]<br/> [[Seville]]<br/> [[Valladolid]]<br/> [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]]<br/> [[Jerez de la Frontera]]<br/> [[Palencia]] <br/> [[M\u00e1laga]]<br/> [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]<br/> [[C\u00e1diz]]<br/> [[Murcia]]<br/> [[Alicante]]<br/> [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] <br/> [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]]\n|-\n| Venezuela \n| [[Tacarigua de Mamporal]]<br/>[[Guatire]]<br/> [[Caracas]]<br/> [[Villa de Cura]]\n|-\n| Vietnam\n| [[:vi:Tu\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh|Tu\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh]]\n|}\n\n==== Brazil ====\n[[File:Igreja Santo Ant\u00f4nio, Florian\u00f3polis, Brasil 000.JPG|thumb|250px|A church in [[Florian\u00f3polis]], Brazil, preparated for the Good Friday celebrations.]]\nHoly Week has developed into one of Brazil's main symbols of community identity, more specifically in the southern town of Campanha. The Campanha Holy Week begins on the Monday evening with the Procession of the Deposit. The figure of Our Lord of the Stations, representing the blood-stained Jesus carrying the cross, is brought from the church in a large black box and displayed in the main square. Then it is solemnly taken to the church following a band and a procession of people. Outside the church, a sermon is delivered on the Easter story of Jesus' death and resurrection. After the sermon, a choir inside the open doors of the church sings the [[Psalm 51|Miserere]] by Manoel Dias de Oliveria, while the black box is brought inside the church, and people come in to kiss the human-sized figure of Christ. Processions on Tuesday and Wednesday stop at different chapels at each of which a large painting portrays episodes of the Way of the Cross and a related hymn is sung at each. On Thursday morning the Chrism Mass is celebrated, with a blessing of the oils. Good Friday afternoon ceremonies are followed by the week's main spectacle of the Taking Down from the Cross in front of the cathedral followed by the Funeral Procession of Our Dead Lord. The drama shows Christ being taken from the cross and placed in a coffin, which is then taken around to the accompaniment of the \"Song of Veronica\". On Saturday morning a drama is performed by the youth. The following night, the Paschal Vigil is celebrated, and the streets are transformed into a beautiful array of intricate, colorful carpets to prepare for the following day. Easter Sunday begins before sunrise with the singing of the choir and band performances to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Bells and fireworks are followed by a Mass that ends with the \"Hallelujah Chorus\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ribeiro|first=Patricia|title=Easter in Brazil|url=http://gobrazil.about.com/od/festivalsevents/p/brazholyweek.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Reily|first=Suzel Ana |title=Remembering the Baroque Era: Historical Consciousness, Local Identity and the Holy Week Celebrations in a Former Mining Town in Brazil |journal=Ethnomusicology Forum|date=June 2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39\u201362|jstor=20184539}}</ref>\n\n==== Guatemala ====\nHoly Week in Guatemala incorporates processions with images of saints carried on huge wooden platforms. The heavy ''andas'' are held by the locals, both men and women, who are frequently in purple robes. The procession is led by a man holding a container of incense accompanied by a small horn and flute band. Intricate carpets (''alfombras'') line the streets during the week's celebration. Easter processions begin at sunrise and everyone comes to join the festivities.\n\nIn Amatenango, the figure of Judas, who betrayed Christ has been the main point of focus during the Mayan Holy Week. The priest calls Judas the \"killer of Christ\".  The figure used to be beaten after the Crucifixion performance on Good Friday, but is now treated more calmly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|title=Guatemala: a Journey Through the Land of the Maya|year=2008|publisher=Purple Moon Publications; 1st edition|isbn=9780615210582}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=June|title=Judas Transformed [Maya, Holy Week]|journal=Natural History|year=1994|volume=103|issue=3}}</ref>\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:Addolorata3.JPG|thumb|250px|Addolorata procession, [[Polistena]], [[Italy]]]]\nHoly Week is also observed in parts of Southern Italy, notably Sicily. The most famous is the Holy Week of [[Trapani]], culminating in the [[Processione dei Misteri di Trapani]] or simply the ''Misteri di Trapani'' (in English the ''Procession of the Mysteries of Trapani'' or the ''Mysteries of Trapani''), a day-long passion procession featuring twenty floats of lifelike wood, canvas and glue sculptures of individual scenes of the events of the Passion.\n\nThe Misteri are amongst the oldest continuously running religious events in Europe, having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612, and running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours; they are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy. Similar but smaller or shorter passion processions are held in many other Sicilian cities, like [[Erice]] and [[Caltanissetta]], but also in various Southern Italian cities, like [[Salerno]] and [[Taranto]].\n\n====Malta====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Malta}}\nThe Holy Week commemorations reach their paramount on Good Friday as the Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities. The Cross follows a significant Way of Jesus. Good Friday processions take place in [[Birgu]], [[Bormla]], [[G\u0127axaq]], [[Luqa]], [[Mosta]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qormi]], [[Rabat]], [[Senglea]], [[Valletta]], [[\u017bebbu\u0121, Malta|\u017bebbu\u0121]] and [[\u017bejtun]].

The rituals date back to the early seventeenth century, at the time of pioneering [[Jesuit]] priest.<ref name=\"rimjournal\" /> The major event of the Yaqui Indians during Holy Week occurs on Wednesday evening in which people arrive at the church on horseback and begin to crawl and dance naked on the floor. Light begins to go out and people beguin the whipping, screaming and crying to the sound of traditional music of sacrifice. In [[Tucson]], dancers are used to wear dark coats and black hide masks, instead of blankets.<ref name=\"rimjournal\">{{cite web|url= http://www.rimjournal.com/arizyson/easter.htm/|title= Yaqui and Mayo Indian Easter ceremonies}}</ref>\n\nChildren in white robes with blue painted faces and a dark hooded figure, symbolizing the betrayer of Christ, join the Thursday morning procession to the church. There they promise to serve God for the next three or five years, until their eyes start to bleed just like Christ's would. That night, there is a symbolic search for Jesus when the \"Pharisees\" visit various crosses in the streets and capture the \"old man\" (symbolic Jesus). On Friday \na member of the church who volunteers to represent Jesus is beaten and buried for two days. On Saturday, an image of Jesus' betrayer, [[Judas Iscariot]], and takes place an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] battle destroying the evil which has been accumulated in the town during the next year.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl= http://what-when-how.com/native-americans/yaqui-native-americans-of-the-southwest/|\ntitle= Yaqui (Native Americans of the Southwest)|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121201071204/http://what-when-how.com/native-americans/yaqui-native-americans-of-the-southwest/|archive-date= 1 December 2012|url-status=}}</ref> Sunday celebrates the Christ's resurrection filled with beautiful flowers and fireworks, while the volunteer rises from where he was buried.

Most stores are closed and most people in the cities return to their home provinces to commemorate Holy Week in their home town.\n\nHoly Week is commemorated with street processions featuring wheeled ''carrozas'' or floats carrying various icons, the [[Way of the Cross]], and a [[Passion play]] called the ''Sen\u00e1kulo''. In some communities (most famously in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]]), the processions include devotees who self-flagellate and sometimes even have themselves nailed to crosses as expressions of penance. After 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] on Good Friday (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), noise is discouraged, many [[radio|radio stations]] and [[television|television stations]] [[closedown|close down]] (some broadcast religious programming, with non-Catholic owned stations continuing broadcast), and the faithful are urged to keep a solemn and prayerful disposition through to [[Easter]] Sunday.\n\nAt [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on [[Palm Sunday]], Catholics carry \"palasp\u00e1s\" or palm leaves to be blessed by the priest.  Many Filipinos bring home the palm leaves after the Mass and place these above their front doors or their windows, believing that doing so can ward off evil spirits. Holy Monday marks the beginning of the ''Pabasa'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], \"reading\"), the marathon chanting of the [[Pasyon|Pasy\u00f3n]], a [[poem]] narrating Jesus' life and death. The chanting, which continues day and night without interruption, lasts as long as two straight days.\n\nOne of the most important Holy Week traditions in the Philippines is the ''[[Seven Churches Visitation|Visita Iglesia]]'' (Spanish for \"church visit\").<ref name=PhilStar2015>{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=IN PHOTOS: A look at churches where Pinoys spend Visita Iglesia|url=http://www.philstar.com/travel-and-tourism/2015/04/02/1440184/photos-look-churches-where-pinoys-spend-visita-iglesia|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=philstar.com|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=2 April 2015}}</ref> On Maundy Thursday, the faithful visit seven churches to pray the [[Stations of the Cross]], and in the evenings, pray in front of each church's Altar of Repose.<ref name=GMA2015>{{cite news|last1=Bartolome|first1=Jessica|title=Doing the Visita Iglesia in Metro Manila|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/463006/lifestyle/artandculture/map-doing-the-visita-iglesia-in-metro-manila|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=GMA News|date=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe last Mass before [[Easter]] is also celebrated on Maundy Thursday, usually including a reenactment of the [[Washing of the Feet]] of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. This Mass is followed by the procession of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] to be transferred to the [[Altar of Repose]]. [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the commemoration of Jesus' [[Seven last words]] (Siete Palabras) and a Passion play called the [[Passion play|Sinakulo]].\n\nEaster Day is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn ''[[Salubong]]'' rite, wherein statues of Jesus and Mary are brought in procession together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' [[Resurrection]]. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass. Most Catholic communities across the Philippines practice this, though it is more popularly celebrated in the provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/254165/lifestyle/artandculture/easter-salubong-rooted-in-culture-family-ties|title=Easter Salubong: Rooted in culture, family ties|website=GMA News Online|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> The rite, originally called the ''encuentro'', was introduced by Spanish priests during the colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/382513/faithful-rejoice-at-salubong|title=Faithful rejoice at 'salubong'|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Spain}}\n[[File:Carroza de la visi\u00f3n de San Juan, conocida como \"la bola\", Paso Blanco, Semana Santa Lorca.jpg|thumb|Holy week in [[Lorca, Spain]]]]\n\n[[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba,_Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Murcia]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]], [[Palencia]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] or [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] hold elaborate processions for Holy Week. A tradition dating from [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] that has spread to other cities in [[Andalusia]], the ''\"Semana Santa en Sevilla\"'' is notable for featuring the procession of '''\"pasos\"''', lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus's arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son. Holy week processions in Seville include marching bands that escort the pasos.<ref>Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/spain-marches-and-saetas-accompany-holy-week-processions \"In Seville Marches And Saetas Accompany Holy Week Processions\"], ''Catholics & Cultures'' updated 27 June 2018</ref>\n\nIn M\u00e1laga, the lifelike wooden or plaster sculptures are called \"tronos\" and they are carried through the streets by \"costaleros\" ( Translated literally as \"sack men\", because of the ''costal'', a sack-like cloth that they wear over their neck, to soften the burden). These pasos and tronos are physically carried on their necks or \"braceros\" (this name is popular in Leon). The paso can weigh up to five metric tonnes. In front of them walk the penitentes, dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles for up to 11 hours. The pasos are set up and maintained by ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'', religious brotherhoods that are common to a specific area of the city, whose precede the paso dressed in Roman military costumes or penitential robes.\n\nThose members who wish to do so wear these penitential robes with conical hats, or ''[[capirotes]]'', used to conceal the face of the wearer. These \"Nazarenos\" or \"Papones\" (this word is typical from Leon) carry processional candles, may walk the city streets barefoot, and may carry shackles and chains in their feet as penance. A brass band, marching band, a drum and bugle band, or in the cases of [[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]] and M\u00e1laga a military band (such as that of the [[Spanish Legion]] or other military units) may accompany the group, playing funeral marches, hymns or \"marchas\" written for the occasion.\n\n===Music===\n{{listen\n | filename    = Tomas Luis de Victoria O vos omnes (The Tudor Consort).ogg\n | title       = Fifth responsory for Holy Saturday\n | description = [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''[[O vos omnes]]'' performed live by [[The Tudor Consort]] (2003)\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nMusic for the Holy Week includes [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]], [[Responsories for Holy Week]], [[Passion oratorio]]s and [[Easter oratorio]]s.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae'' (1585) contains settings of 37 texts for the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the Holy Week. [[Carlo Gesualdo]]'s ''[[Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia]]'' (1611) contains settings of all 27 [[Tenebrae]] responsories (for [[matins]] of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday), and of a few other text for use in [[lauds]] of the Holy Week. ''[[Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres]]'' as composed by various French baroque composers were usually intended for performance during the evening of [[Holy Wednesday]], Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.\n\n==Holy Week in Eastern Christianity==\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nIn the [[Orthodox Church]], the forty days of [[Great Lent]] end on the Friday before Palm Sunday. The two days that follow, [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]], form a transition to Holy Week, neither in Lent nor in Holy Week themselves, but in combination with Holy Week containing the continuing observances in preparation for [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter), during which the faithful continue to fast.\n\nLazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' [[Raising of Lazarus|raising]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, just before he went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes anticipate the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, [[caviar]]), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday is considered one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday [[Canonical hours|liturgies]] are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday liturgy.\n\nHoly Week is referred to as \"Great and Holy Week\", or \"Passion Week\".<ref>Triodion (standard Orthodox service book)</ref> Since the Orthodox liturgical day starts at sunset (as it has from antiquity), Holy Monday liturgies begin Sunday evening, at the normal timing for Monday Vespers (Vespers is the first liturgy of the day). However, during Holy Week, in most parishes, many liturgy times are advanced from six to twelve hours in time and celebrated in anticipation, which permits more of the faithful to attend the most prominent liturgies. Thus, it is the [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|matins]] liturgy of Great Monday that is on \"Palm Sunday\" evening in parish churches and often [[vespers]] is in the morning.\n\n[[Fasting]] during Great and Holy Week is very strict, as in Lent at a minimum: dairy products and meat products are strictly forbidden, and on most days, no alcoholic beverages are permitted and no oil is used in cooking.  Holy Friday and Holy Saturday especially may exceed Lenten norms. Those who can, including monastics, observe them as days of abstention, meaning that nothing is eaten on those days. However, fasting is always adjusted to the needs of the individual, and those who are very young, ill or elderly are not expected to fast as strictly. Those who are able may receive the blessing of their [[spiritual father]] to observe an even stricter fast, whereby they eat only two meals that week: one on Wednesday night and one after [[Divine Liturgy]] on Thursday.\n\n====Great and Holy Monday through Wednesday====\n{{Main|Holy Monday|Holy Tuesday|Holy Wednesday}}\n[[File:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ the Bridegroom, sitting above the star at [[Golgotha]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nA new liturgical day beginning at sunset, the first liturgy of each day is [[vespers]] at which [[sticheron|stichera]] are chanted elaborating the theme of the new day.\n\nThese days' Orthros liturgies (which in parishes is performed the previous night) are often referred to as the \"Bridegroom Prayer\", because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the [[troparion]] that is solemnly chanted during them. On these days, an [[icon]] of the \"Bridegroom\" is placed on an [[analogion]] in the center of the [[temple]], portraying Jesus wearing the purple [[robe]] of mockery and crowned with a [[crown of thorns]] (see [[Instruments of the Passion]]).\n\nThe same theme is repeated in the [[exapostilarion]], a hymn which occurs near the end of the liturgy. These liturgies follow much the same pattern as liturgies on weekdays of [[Great Lent]]. The liturgies are so laid out that the entire [[Psalter]] (with the exception of [[Kathisma]] XVII) is chanted on the first three days of Holy Week. The [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] that is chanted on these days is a \"Triode\", i.e., composed of three [[ode]]s instead of the usual nine, as is in other weekday liturgies in the [[Triodion]].\n\nTowards the end of the Tuesday evening Bridegroom liturgy (Orthros for Great and Holy Wednesday), the ''[[Kassia|Hymn of Kassiani]]'' is sung. The [[hymn]], (written in the 9th century by [[Kassia]]) tells of the woman who washed Christ's feet in the house of [[Simon the Pharisee]].<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|7:36\u201350}}</ref> Much of the hymn is written from the perspective of the sinful woman:\n\n<blockquote>O Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, sensing Your Divinity, takes upon herself the duty of a myrrh-bearer. With lamentations she brings you myrrh in anticipation of your entombment. \"Woe to me!\" she cries, \"for me night has become a frenzy of licentiousness, a dark and moonless love of sin. Receive the fountain of my tears, O You who gathers into clouds the waters of the sea. Incline unto me,  unto the sighings of my heart, O You who bowed the heavens by your ineffable condescension. I will wash your immaculate feet with kisses and dry them again with the tresses of my hair; those very feet at whose sound Eve hid herself from in fear when she heard You walking in Paradise in the twilight of the day. As for the multitude of my sins and the depths of Your judgments, who can search them out, O Savior of souls, my Savior? Do not disdain me Your handmaiden, O You who are boundless in mercy.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn vespers at the end of Monday through Wednesday is a reading from the Gospel which sets forth the new day's theme and then the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] may be celebrated.\n\nThe Byzantine musical composition expresses the poetry so strongly that it leaves many people in a state of prayerful tears. The Hymn can last upwards of 25 minutes and is liturgically and musically a highpoint of the entire year.\n\n====Great and Holy Thursday====\n{{Main|Holy Thursday}}\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\n\nIn many churches, especially Greek Orthodox, a liturgy of [[Anointing]] ([[Holy Unction]]) is held on Wednesday evening, following the Presanctified Liturgy. This is in commemoration of the [[anointing of Jesus]], and a preparation of the faithful to enter with Christ into his death and Resurrection. Those who wish to receive [[Holy Communion]] on Great and Holy Thursday, are encouraged to receive the [[Holy Mystery]] of Unction.\n\nOrthros of Great and Holy Thursday does not follow the format of Great Lent (with the singular exception of chanting [[Alleluia]] in place of [[God is the Lord]]), but is celebrated as outside Lent, having a complete canon. Also, beginning at this liturgy there will be no more reading of the psalter for the rest of Holy Week, with the exception of [[kathisma]] XVII at Orthros of Great and Holy Saturday.\n\nDivine Liturgy of the [[Last Supper]] is held on the morning of Great and Holy Thursday, combining Vespers with the [[Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great]]. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the [[Holy Table]] (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and [[monastery|monasteries]] it is customary for the [[bishop]] or [[hegumen]] (abbot) to celebrate the [[Washing of Feet]]. When it is necessary for an [[autocephalous]] church to consecrate more [[chrysm]] the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of that church will consecrate it at this Liturgy.\n\nGreat and Holy Thursday is the only day during Holy Week when those observing the strict tradition will eat a cooked meal, though they will not do so until after the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the Liturgy. At this meal wine and oil are permitted, but the faithful still abstain from meat and dairy products.\n\n====Great and Holy Friday====\n{{Main|Good Friday}}\nMatins of Great and Holy Friday is celebrated on the evening of Holy Thursday. During this liturgy, twelve [[Matins Gospel]]s are chanted, from which this liturgy derives its name of \"Matins of the Twelve Gospels\".  These Gospel lessons recount in chronological order the events from the Last Supper though the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]] of Jesus. At one point, when we reach the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large [[crucifix|cross]] with an [[icon]] the crucified Christ attached to it, and places it in the center of the [[nave]] for all the faithful to venerate. This cross will remain in the center of the church until the bringing out of the [[epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] the next evening.\n\nOn Great and Holy Friday morning the [[Royal Hours]] are served. These are a solemn celebration of the [[Little Hours]] with added hymns and readings.\n\n[[File:Hautausikoni.jpg|thumb|250px|The Epitaphios (Plashchanitza) placed in the [[nave]] of the church for the faithful to venerate. The [[Gospel Book]] rests in the center.]]\n\nVespers of Great and Holy Friday (Vespers of the [[Deposition from the Cross]]) is held in the morning or early afternoon of Great and Holy Friday. The figure of Christ is taken down from the Cross, and a richly embroidered cloth icon called the ''[[Epitaphios (liturgy)|Epitaphios]]'' ([[Church Slavonic]]: ''Plashchanitza'') depicting Christ prepared for burial is laid in a \"[[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]]\" decorated with flowers. At the end of the liturgy all come forward to venerate the Epitaphios.\n\n[[Compline]] of Great and Holy Friday contains a Canon of Lamentations of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]).\n\n====Great and Holy Saturday====\n{{Main|Holy Saturday}}\n[[File:Epitaphios Procession Beginning at Great Saturday Mattins.jpg|thumb|250px|Beginning of the epitaphios procession at Great Saturday Mattins]]\n\nMatins of Great and Holy Saturday is, in parish practice, held on Friday evening. The liturgy is known as the \"Orthros of [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Lamentations at the Tomb]]\", because the majority of the liturgy is composed of the clergy and faithful gathered around the tomb, chanting the \"Lamentations\" interspersed between the verses of Kathisma XVII ([[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]]). At a certain point the priest sprinkles the tomb with rose petals and [[rose water]]. Near the end of the liturgy, the Epitaphios is carried in a candlelit procession around the outside of the church as the faithful sing the [[Trisagion]].\n\n[[Vespers]] joined to the [[Divine Liturgy]] is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning.  This is the ''Proti Anastasi'' (First Resurrection) liturgy, commemorating the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the liturgy changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the [[Paschal kiss]], since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\nIf there are [[catechumens]] who are prepared for [[baptism]] they are baptized and [[chrismation|chrismated]] during the Old Testament readings.\n\n[[File:Receiving the Holy Light at Easter.jpg|thumb|250px|People receiving the Holy Light at Easter from Father Diogenis at St George Greek Orthodox Church [[Adelaide]]]]\n\nOn Saturday night, the [[Paschal Vigil]] begins around 11:00&nbsp;pm with the chanting of the [[Midnight Office]]. Afterwards, all of the lighting in the church is extinguished and all remain in silence and darkness until the stroke of midnight. Then, the priest lights a single candle from the [[eternal flame]] on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread from person to person until everyone holds a lighted candle.\n\nA procession then circles around the outside of the church, recreating the journey of the [[Myrrh Bearers]] as they journeyed to the [[Tomb of Jesus]] on the first Easter morning. The procession stops in front of the closed doors of the church. The opening of these doors symbolized the \"rolling away of the stone\" from the tomb by the angel, and all enter the church joyfully singing the [[Troparion]] of [[Easter|Pascha]]. Paschal Orthros begins with an [[Ektenia]] (litany) and the chanting of the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]].\n\nOne of the highpoints is the sharing of the [[paschal kiss]] and the reading of the ''[[Paschal Homily|Hieratikon]]'' ([[Catechism|Catechetical]] [[Homily]] of [[John Chrysostom]]) by the priest. The Divine Liturgy follows, and every Orthodox Christian is encouraged to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] on this holiest day of the year. A [[breakfast]] usually follows, sometimes lasting till dawn. Slavs bring [[Easter basket]]s filled with eggs, meat, butter, and cheese\u2014foods from which the faithful have abstained during [[Great Lent]]\u2014to be blessed by the priest which are then taken back home to be shared by family and friends with joy.\n\nOn the afternoon of Easter Day, a joyful liturgy called \"[[Agape feast|Agape]] Vespers\" is celebrated. During this liturgy, the [[Prokeimenon|Great Prokeimenon]] is chanted and a lesson from the Gospel<ref>{{bibleref2|John|20:19\u201325}}</ref> is read in as many different languages as possible, accompanied by the joyful ringing of bells.\n\n===Coptic Orthodox Church===\nThe Coptic Orthodox Christians fast the Lent for 55 days including the Holy Week which they call Holy Paschal Week.<ref>http://www.zeitun-eg.org/paschag2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Friday before Palm Sunday is called \"The Concluding Friday of Great Lent\". On this day a special liturgy called \"The Unction of the Sick\" is conducted. It consists of seven prayers and at the conclusion of the prayers, the priest anoints each member of the congregation with the holy oil.\n\nThe following day \u2013 the last Saturday before Holy Week \u2013 is called \"Lazarus' Saturday\". On this day the Coptic Church commemorates [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], the brother of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]]. This day is related to the events of Holy Week in that John 12 tells of a visit of Jesus to Lazarus immediately before recounting the events of Palm Sunday.\n\nSince the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\nThroughout Holy Week, a paschal liturgy is conducted each evening, starting on Sunday night (the eve of Monday), and every morning, up until Easter. These paschal liturgies take place in the middle of the church, not on the altar, because Jesus suffered and was crucified on Golgotha, outside of Jerusalem. The altar is bared of all its coverings and relics.\n\nEach day liturgy is divided into 5 \"hours\"; The First Hour, The Third Hour, The Sixth Hour, The Ninth Hour, and The Eleventh Hour.\nLikewise, each night liturgy is also divided into the same five hours. However, Good Friday has an extra hour added to it, that of The Twelfth Hour.\nDuring each hour, one prophecy is read at the beginning, a hymn is chanted twelve times, a psalm is sung in a sad tune, one passage from a gospel is read, and an exposition concludes the hour.\nDuring the eve of Friday, four gospel passages are read, and more prophecies are read as well.\nFrom Tuesday night onward, the people do not greet each other nor the priests, and do not even kiss the icons of saints in the church, because it was with a kiss that Judas betrayed Jesus.\n\nOn Thursday of Holy Week, also called Covenant Thursday, a liturgy is prayed and communion is given to symbolize the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus. Also, before the liturgy the priests wash the feet of the congregation in imitation of Jesus washing his disciples' feet.\n\nLate Friday night until early Saturday morning is called Apocalypse Night. During this night, another liturgy is prayed and the entire [[Book of the Apocalypse]] is read, to symbolize the [[Second Coming]].\n\nThe series concludes with the Easter liturgy on Saturday night, followed by a gathering in the church where the participants can celebrate the joy of the resurrection, eating together and ending their long fast, and at which they are permitted once again to partake of meat, fish, and dairy products.\n\n===Eastern Catholic Churches===\nEastern Catholic Churches' Holy Week observances and customs are generally the same as in the rites of the corresponding Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Church or Assyrian Church of the East.\n\n==Related observances==\n===Friday of Sorrows===\n{{Main|Friday of Sorrows}}\nThe religious processions that are part of the Holy Week celebrations in many countries begin two days before Holy Week on what in those countries is called Friday of Sorrows.\n\nOn the Friday before Holy Week, the [[Roman Rite]] celebrated universally from 1727 to 1969 a liturgical feast of the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]]. Celebration of this feast began in Germany but spread to many other countries even before [[Pope Benedict XIII]] made it a universal feast, assigning it to the Friday before Palm Sunday. Another feast with the same name was and still is celebrated in September.<ref>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|no-icon=1|prescript=|first=Frederick|last=Holweck|wstitle=Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary}}</ref> With his [[Code of Rubrics]] of 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] reduced the feast on the Friday of what was then called Passion Week (the week before Holy Week) to the level of a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]], and in 1969 the celebration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] as a duplicate of the September feast.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 2002 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] provides an alternative [[collect]] for this Friday:<ref>Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nO God, who in this season\ngive your Church the grace\nto imitate devoutly the Blessed Virgin Mary\nin contemplating the Passion of Christ,\ngrant, we pray, through her intercession,\nthat we may cling more firmly each day\nto your Only Begotten Son\nand come at last to the fullness of his grace.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis provision of an alternative collect was the equivalent of granting the Lenten celebration of Our Lady of Sorrow the rank of [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]], since during Lent a memorial, even if otherwise obligatory, is represented in the liturgy of the day at most by optional use of its collect.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20030317_ordinamento-messale_en.html General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355] and [https://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/Info/GNLY.pdf Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar, 14]</ref> The liturgical calendar of [[Malta]] gives the celebration the rank of feast, making its observance obligatory. Observance of the Tridentine Mass calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', giving Our Lady of Sorrows a [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] within the liturgy of the Friday.\n\nIn many [[Latin American]] countries, such as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Peru]], as well as in [[Spain]] and the Philippines, this Friday feast of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is called ''Viernes de Dolores'' ([[Friday of Sorrows]]). It is sometimes also referred to as \"Council Friday\", because of the choice of John 11:47\u201354 as the Gospel passage read in the [[Tridentine Mass]] on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the meeting of the [[Sanhedrin]] to discuss what to do with Jesus. Its date is exactly a week before [[Good Friday]].\n\nThe somber and often nocturnal commemoration with public processions directs thoughts to the desolate emotional state of the Virgin Mary on Black Saturday as prophesied by the Rabbi Simeon on the \"seven sorrows\" that as an allegorical sword pierced her heart. She is represented as worrying and grieving with Saint [[Mary Magdalene]] for Jesus; therefore the event is markedly similar to a [[mourning]] event among the people.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Divine Mercy Sunday]]\n*[[Holy Week in Mexico]]\n*[[Holy Week in Spain]]\n*[[Holy Week in the Philippines]]\n*[[Holy Week procession]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n<ref>Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/brazil/holy-week-ouro-preto \"Holy Week in Ouro Preto\"], ''Catholics & Cultures'' updated 5 May 2016</ref>\n\n{{Commons category}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Easter}}\n* {{cite web|url= https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=igeo%2bpassion%2bplace&view=detail&mid=5FD1243F2D09F3B2EA845FD1243F2D09F3B2EA84&FORM=VRRTAP|title= The historical places of the Holy Week|language= es|publisher= igeo.tv}}\n\n[[Category:Divine Mercy]]\n[[Category:Easter liturgy]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:Religious events]]\n[[Category:Weeks]]\n", "name_user": "RioVerde", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor edit.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week"}

It also played a major supporting role, alongside the Royal Navy, in the European war against Germany.\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II|Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) sought naval superiority in the Pacific by sinking the main American battle fleet at Pearl Harbor, which was built around its battleships. The December 1941 surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] did knock out the battle fleet, but it did not touch the aircraft carriers, which became the mainstay of the rebuilt fleet.\n\nNaval doctrine had to be changed overnight. The United States Navy (like the IJN) had followed [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Thayer Mahan's]] emphasis on concentrated groups of battleships as the main offensive naval weapons.<ref>Trent Hone, \"The Evolution of Fleet Tactical Doctrine in the U.S. Navy, 1922-1941,\" ''Journal of Military History'' (2003) 67#4 pp. 1107-1148 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3396884 in JSTOR]</ref> The loss of the battleships at Pearl Harbor forced Admiral [[Ernest J.

It achieved notable acclaim in the [[Pacific War]], where it was instrumental to the Allies' successful \"[[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]]\" campaign.<ref name=\"Stephen Howarth 1999\"/> The U.S. Navy fought five great battles with the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN): the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], and the [[Battle of Okinawa]].<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Two-Ocean War: A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War'' (1963)</ref>\n\nBy war's end in 1945, the United States Navy had added thousands of new ships, including 18 aircraft carriers and 8 battleships, and had over 70% of the world's total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1,000 tons or greater.<ref name=\"Defense Analysis; Dec2001, Vol. 17 Issue 3, p259-265\">Weighing the U.S. Navy Defense & Security Analysis, Volume 17, Issue 3 December 2001, pp. 259 - 265.</ref><ref>King, Ernest J., USN.

It assumed that the United States was allied with Britain and France and provided for offensive operations by American forces in Europe, Africa, or both.  The assumptions and plans for Rainbow 5 were discussed extensively in the [[Plan Dog memo]], which concluded ultimately that the United States would adhere to a [[Europe first]] strategy, making the war against Germany a higher priority than the war against Japan.  However President Roosevelt did not approve the plan\u2014he wanted to play it by ear.<ref>{{cite book|author=George W.

Stoler, \"The 'Pacific-First' Alternative in American World War II Strategy.\" ''International History Review'' 2#3 (1980): 432-452.</ref>\n\nU.S. strategy in 1941 was to deter Japan from further advances toward British, Dutch, French and American territories to the South.  When the Allies cut off sales of oil to Japan, it lost 90% of its fuel supply for airplanes and warships.  It had stocks that would last a year or two.  It had to compromise or fight to recapture British and Dutch wells to the South.  in November 1941, U.S. Army Chief of Staff [[George Marshall]] explained the American air war strategy to the press\u2014it was top secret and not for publication:\n:We are preparing for an offensive war against Japan, whereas the Japs believe we are preparing only to defend the Philippines. ...We have 35 Flying Fortresses already there\u2014the largest concentration anywhere in the world. Twenty more will be added next month, and 60 more in January....If war with the Japanese does come, we'll fight mercilessly. Flying fortresses will be dispatched immediately to set the paper cities of Japan on fire. There won't be any hesitation about bombing civilians\u2014it will be all-out.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCormack|title=Japan at War 1931\u201345: As the Cherry Blossom Falls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9jyDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT136|year=2017|page=136}}</ref>\n\nMarshall was talking about long-range B-17 bombers based in the Philippines, which were within range of Tokyo. After Japan captured the Philippines in early 1942, American strategy refocused on a naval war focusing on the capture of islands close enough for the intensive bombing campaign Marshall spoke about. In 1944, the Navy captured [[Saipan]] and the Mariana Islands, which were within range of the new B-29 bombers.\n\nAfter its Pearl Harbor victory in early December the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) seemed unstoppable because it outnumbered and outgunned the disorganized Allies\u2014US, Britain, Netherlands, Australia, China. London and Washington both believed in Mahanian doctrine, which stressed the need for a unified fleet. However, in contrast to the cooperation achieved by the armies, the Allied navies failed to combine or even coordinate their activities until mid-1942. Tokyo also believed in [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], who said command of the seas\u2014achieved by great fleet battles\u2014was the key to sea power. Therefore, the IJN kept its main strike force together under Admiral Yamamoto and won a series of stunning victories over the Americans and British in the 90 days after Pearl Harbor.\n\nOutgunned at sea, with its big guns lying at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, the American strategy for victory required a slow retreat or holding action against the IJN until the much greater industrial potential of the US could be mobilized to launch a fleet capable of projecting Allied power to the enemy heartland.\n\n====Midway====\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\nThe Battle of Midway, together with the Guadalcanal campaign, marked the turning point in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-1.htm |title=Battle of Midway: June&nbsp;4\u20137,1942 |publisher=Naval History & Heritage Command |date=27 April 2005 |accessdate=20 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090302032014/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-1.htm| archivedate= 2 March 2009 | url-status= live}} \"...considered the decisive battle of the war in the Pacific.\"</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Dull | first=Paul S | title=Battle History of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1941\u20131945 | date= | publisher=US Naval Institute Press |isbn=1-59114-219-9 | pages=}} \"Midway ''was'' indeed \"the\" decisive battle of the war in the Pacific.\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SLfti-Dc1AcC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=Midway+decisive+battle&source=bl&ots=wRGD-EQNKv&sig=Qx7UryTe62zBfpbra_SQBu6w2mk&hl=en&ei=B6-gSbTqE5HItQO3-ajdCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA166,M1 p. 166]</ref><ref name=\"Midway Decisive\">{{Cite web| last = | first = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612040835/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | archivedate = 12 June 2007 | title = A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers: Battle of Midway | work = | publisher = U.S. Navy | accessdate = 12 June 2007}}</ref> Between June 4\u20137, 1942, the [[United States Navy]] decisively defeated a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese naval force]] that had sought to lure the U.S. carrier fleet into a trap at [[Midway Atoll]]. The Japanese fleet lost four aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser to the U.S. Navy's [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|one American carrier]] and a [[destroyer]]. After Midway, and the exhausting attrition of the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], Japan's shipbuilding and pilot training programs were unable to keep pace in replacing their losses while the U.S. steadily increased its output in both areas. Military historian [[John Keegan]] called the Battle of Midway \"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\"<ref>Keegan, John. \"The Second World War.\" New York: Penguin, 2005. (275)</ref>\n\n====Guadalcanal====\n{{Main|Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nGuadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943,  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign saw American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders) in a six months campaign slowly overwhelm determined Japanese resistance. Guadalcanal was the key to control the [[Solomon Islands]], which both sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines.\n\nThe rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides dividing the victories. They were: [[Battle of Savo Island]], [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], [[Battle of Cape Esperance]], [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] and [[Battle of Rennell Island]]. Both sides pulled out their aircraft carriers, as they were too vulnerable to land-based aviation.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942-February 1943'' (1949)</ref>\n\n====1943====\nIn preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Navy started the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Enormous effort went into recruiting and training sailors and Marines, and building warships, warplanes and support ships in preparation for a thrust across the Pacific, and to support Army operations in the Southwest Pacific, as well as in Europe and North Africa.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''A Companion to American Military History'' (2010) 1: 205-7, 402-3</ref>\n\n====1944====\nThe Navy continued its long movement west across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured; some, like the big bases at Truk, Rabaul and Formosa were neutralized by air attack and then simply leapfrogged. The ultimate goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks and finally an invasion. The US Navy did not seek out the Japanese fleet for a decisive battle, as [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahanian]] doctrine would suggest; the enemy had to attack to stop the inexorable advance.\n\nThe climax of the carrier war came at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref>William T. Y'Blood, ''Red Sun Setting: The Battle of the Philippine Sea'' (2003)</ref> Taking control of islands that could support airfields within B-29 range of Tokyo was the objective. 535 ships began landing 128,000 Army and Marine invaders on June 15, 1944, in the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana and Palau Islands]]. The Japanese launched an ill-coordinated attack on the larger American fleet; its planes operated at extreme ranges and could not keep together, allowing them to be easily shot down in what Americans jokingly called the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.\"<ref>Barrett Tillman, ''Clash of the Carriers: The True Story of the Marianas Turkey Shoot of World War II'' (2005)</ref> \nJapan had now lost most of its offensive capabilities, and the U.S. had air bases on Guam, Saipan and Tinian for B-29 bombers targeted at Japan's home islands.\n\nThe final act of 1944 was the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the last naval battle in history in which the battle line of one navy \"crossed the T\" of the battle line of its enemy, enabling the crossing line to fire the full broadsides of its main batteries as against only the forward guns of only the enemy's lead ship.  The Japanese plan was to lure the main body of the U.S. fleet away from the action at Leyte Gulf by decoying it with a dummy fleet far to the north, and then to close in on the U.S. Army and Marines landing at Leyte with a pincer movement of two squadrons of battleships, and annihilate them.  The movements of these Japanese fleet components were terribly uncoordinated, resulting in piecemeal slaughter of Japanese fleet units in the Sibuyan Sea and the Surigao Strait (where \"the T was crossed\"), but, although the ruse to lure the main body of the U.S. fleet away had worked to perfection, the Japanese were unaware of this, with the result that an overwhelmingly superior remaining force of Japanese battleships and cruisers that massively outnumbered and outgunned the few U.S. fleet units left behind at Leyte, thinking it was sailing into the jaws of the more powerful U.S. main body, turned tail and ran away without exploiting its hard-won advantage.  After which Japan had now lost all its offensive naval capability.\n\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku and two destroyers under attack on 20 June 1944 (80-G-238025).jpg|300px|thumb|The carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] (center) and two destroyers under attack June 20, 1944]]\n\n====Okinawa 1945====\n{{Main|Battle of Okinawa}}\nOkinawa was the last great battle of the entire war. The goal was to make the island into a staging area for the [[invasion of Japan]] scheduled for fall 1945. It was just 350 miles (550&nbsp;km) south of the Japanese home islands. Marines and soldiers landed on 1 April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans losing their lives. Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilots exacted the largest loss of ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000 wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 men. The fierce combat and high American losses led the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the [[atomic bomb]] to induce surrender.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to World War II'' (2002) p 279</ref>\n\n====Naval technology: US vs Japan====\nTechnology and industrial power proved decisive. Japan failed to exploit its early successes before the immense potential power of the Allies could be brought to bear. In 1941 the Japanese [[Zero fighter]] had a longer range and better performance than rival American warplanes, and the pilots had more experience in the air.<ref>Robert Jackson, ''Mitsubishi Zero'' (2005)</ref>  But Japan never improved the Zero and by 1944 the Allied navies were far ahead of Japan in both quantity and quality, and ahead of Germany in quantity and in putting advanced technology to practical use. High tech innovations arrived with dizzying rapidity. Entirely new weapons systems were invented\u2014like the landing ships,  such as the 3,000-ton LST (\"[[Landing Ship, Tank]]\") that carried 25 tanks thousands of miles and landed them right on the assault beaches. Furthermore, older weapons systems were constantly upgraded and improved. Obsolescent airplanes, for example, received more powerful engines and more sensitive radar sets. One impediment to progress was that admirals who had grown up with great battleships and fast cruisers had a hard time adjusting their war-fighting doctrines to incorporate the capability and flexibility of the rapidly evolving new weapons systems.\n\n====Ships====\nThe ships of the American and Japanese forces were closely matched at the beginning of the war. By 1943 the American qualitative edge was winning battles; by 1944 the American quantitative advantage made the Japanese position hopeless. The German navy, distrusting its Japanese ally, ignored Hitler's orders to cooperate and failed to share its expertise in radar and radio. Thus the Imperial Navy was further handicapped in the technological race with the Allies (who did cooperate with each other). The United States economic base was ten times larger than Japan's, and its technological capabilities also significantly greater, and it mobilized engineering skills much more effectively than Japan, so that technological advances came faster and were applied more effectively to weapons. Above all, American admirals adjusted their doctrines of naval warfare to exploit the advantages. The quality and performance of the warships of Japan were initially comparable to those of the US.\n\nThe Americans were supremely, and perhaps overly, confident in 1941. Pacific commander Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] boasted he could beat a bigger fleet because of \"...our superior personnel in resourcefulness and initiative, and the undoubted superiority of much of our equipment.\" As Willmott notes, it was a dangerous and ill-founded assumption.<ref>Quoted in H. P. Willmott, ''The barrier and the javelin: Japanese and Allied Pacific strategies, February to June 1942'' (Naval Institute Press, 1983) p 198</ref> Nimitz would later make good on his boast by defeating a larger Japanese force in the [[Battle of Midway]] and turning the tide in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Keegan 2005, p. 275</ref>\n\n====Battleships====\nThe American battleships before Pearl Harbor could fire salvos of nine 2,100-pound armor-piercing shells every minute to a range of 35,000 yards (19 miles). No ship except another battleship had the thick armor that could withstand that kind of firepower. When intelligence reported that Japan had secretly built even more powerful battleships, Washington responded with four ''Iowa''-class battleships. The \"big-gun\" admirals on both sides dreamed of a great shootout at twenty-mile (32&nbsp;km) range, in which carrier planes would be used only for spotting the mighty guns. Their doctrine was utterly out of date. A plane like the Grumman TBF Avenger could drop a 2,000-pound bomb on a battleship at a range of hundreds of miles. An aircraft carrier cost less, required about the same number of personnel, was just as fast, and could easily sink a battleship. During the war the battleships found new missions: they were platforms holding all together dozens of anti-aircraft guns and eight or nine 14-inch or 16-inch long-range guns used to blast land targets before amphibious landings. Their smaller 5-inch guns, and the 4,800 3-inch to 8-inch guns on cruisers and destroyers also proved effective at bombarding landing zones. After a short bombardment of Tarawa island in November 1943, Marines discovered that the Japanese defenders were surviving in underground shelters. It then became routine doctrine to thoroughly work over beaches with thousands of high-explosive and armor-piercing shells. The bombardment would destroy some fixed emplacements and kill some troops. More important, it severed communication lines, stunned and demoralized the defenders, and gave the landing parties fresh confidence. After the landing, naval gunfire directed by ground observers would target any enemy pillboxes that were still operational. The sinking of the battleships at Pearl Harbor proved a blessing in deep disguise, for after they were resurrected and assigned their new mission they performed well. (Absent Pearl Harbor, big-gun admirals like [[Raymond Spruance]] might have followed prewar doctrine and sought a surface battle in which the Japanese would have been very hard to defeat.)<ref>Christopher Chant, ''An Illustrated Data Guide to Battleships of World War II'' (1997)</ref>\n\n====Naval aviation====\nIn World War I the US Navy explored aviation, both land-based and carrier based. However, the Navy nearly abolished aviation in 1919 when Admiral [[William S. Benson]], the reactionary Chief of Naval Operations, could not \"conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation\", and he secretly tried to abolish the Navy's Aviation Division.<ref>Jeffery S. Underwood, ''The wings of democracy: the influence of air power on the Roosevelt Administration, 1933-1941'' (1991) p. 11</ref> Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed the decision because he believed aviation might someday be \"the principal factor\" at sea with missions to bomb enemy warships, scout enemy fleets, map minefields, and escort convoys. Grudgingly allowing it a minor mission, the Navy slowly built up its aviation. In 1929 it had one carrier ({{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}}), 500 pilots and 900 planes; by 1937 it had 5 carriers (the {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, ''Ranger'', {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}), 2000 pilots and 1000 much better planes. With Roosevelt now in the White House, the tempo soon quickened. One of the main relief agencies, the [[Public Works Administration|PWA]], made building warships a priority. In 1941 the U.S. Navy with 8 carriers, 4,500 pilots and 3,400 planes had more air power than the Japanese Navy.<ref>Jeffery S. Underwood, ''The wings of democracy''</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n{{main|Kriegsmarine}}\n\n==== Submarines ====\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0952-17, Frankreich, Auszeichnungen f\u00fcr U-99-Besatzung.jpg|thumb|[[Otto Kretschmer]] (left) was the [[List of successful U-boat commanders|most successful]] German U-boat commander in the World War II]]\nGermany's main naval weapon was the U-boat; its main mission was to cut off the flow of supplies and munitions reaching Britain by sea. Submarine attacks on Britain's vital maritime supply routes in the \"[[Battle of the Atlantic]]\" started immediately at the outbreak of war. Although they were hampered initially by the lack of well placed ports from which to operate; that changed when France fell in 1940 and Germany took control of all the ports in France and the Low Countries. The U-boats had such a high success rate at first, that the period to early 1941 was known as the [[First Happy Time]]. The ''Kriegsmarine'' was responsible for [[coastal artillery]] protecting major ports and possible invasion points, and also handled anti-aircraft batteries protecting major ports.<ref name = \"Feldgrau38\">[http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=38 Organization of the Kriegsmarine in the West 1940\u20131945] Feldgrau.com</ref>\n\nIn 1939\u20131945 German shipyards launched 1,162 U-boats, of which 785 were destroyed during the war (632 at sea) along with 30,000 crew. The British anti-submarine ships and aircraft accounted for over 500 kills. At the end of the war, 156 U-boats surrendered to the Allies, while the crews scuttled 221 others, chiefly in German ports. In terms of effectiveness, German and other Axis submarines sank 2828 merchant ships totaling 14.7 million tons (11.7 million British); many more were damaged. The use of convoys dramatically reduced the number of sinkings, but convoys made for slow movement and long delays at both ends, and thus reduced the flow of Allied goods. German submarines also sank 175 Allied warships, mostly British, with 52,000 Royal Navy sailors killed.<ref>S.W. Roskill, ''White Ensign: The British Navy at War 1939-1945'' (1960) pp 422-23</ref>\n\n====Surface fleet====\n{{Main|Baltic Sea campaigns (1939\u201345)|Battle of the Atlantic|Commerce raiding|Merchant raiders|Operation Sea Lion|Battle of the Mediterranean|Black Sea campaigns (1941\u201344)}}\nThe German fleet was involved in many operations, starting with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]]. Also in 1939, it sank the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}} and the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|6}}, while losing the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} at the [[Battle of the River Plate]].\n\nIn April 1940, the German navy was heavily involved in the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]], where it lost the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}}, two light cruisers, and ten destroyers. In return it sank the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}} and some smaller ships.\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{main|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|History of the Royal Navy#Second World War}}\nThe Royal Navy in the critical years 1939\u201343 was under the command of [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral [[Dudley Pound|Sir Dudley Pound]] (1877\u20131943). \nAs a result of the earlier changes the Royal Navy entered the [[Second World War]] as a heterogeneous force of World War I veterans, inter-war ships limited by close adherence to treaty restrictions and later unrestricted designs.though smaller and relatively older than it was during World War I, it remained the major naval power up until 1944-45 when it was overtaken by the American navy.\n\nAt the start of World War II, Britain's global commitments were reflected in the Navy's deployment. Its first task remained the protection of trade, since Britain was heavily dependent upon imports of food and raw materials, and the global empire was also interdependent. The navy's assets were allocated between various fleets and stations.<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/#WW2 Royal Navy in World War 2]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!  Fleet / station\n!

His greatest achievement was his successful campaign against German [[U-boat]] activity and the winning of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. [[Winston Churchill]], the civilian head of the Navy (1939\u201340) and of all the forces as Prime Minister (1940\u201345) worked with him closely on naval strategies; he was dubbed \"Churchill's anchor\".<ref>Tony Heathcote, ''The British Admirals of the Fleet 1734 \u2013 1995'' (2002). p 217</ref>  He blocked Churchill's scheme of sending a battle fleet into the Baltic early in the war. However his judgment has been challenged regarding his micromanagement, the failed [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940, his dismissal of [[Dudley North (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Dudley North]] in 1940, Japan's sinking of the [[HMS Repulse (1916)|''Repulse'']] and the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|''Prince of Wales'']] by air attack off Malaya in late 1941, and the failure in July 1942 to disperse [[Convoy PQ 17]] under German attack.<ref>Peter Nailor, \"Great Chiefs of Staff - Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, OM, GCB GCVO,\" ''RUSI Journal'', Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies (1988) Volume 133 Number 1 pp 67-70.</ref>\n\n[[Image:British Battlecruiser HMS Hood circa 1932.jpg|thumb|left|British battlecruiser HMS ''Hood'']]\nDuring the early phases of [[World War II]], the Royal Navy provided critical cover during British evacuations from Norway (where an aircraft carrier and 6 destroyers were lost but 338,000 men were evacuated), [[Operation Dynamo|from Dunkirk]] (where 7,000 RN men were killed) and at the [[Battle of Crete]]. In the latter operation [[Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]] ran great risks to extract the Army, and saved many men to fight another day. The prestige of the Navy suffered a severe blow when the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']]  was sunk by the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941. Although the ''Bismarck'' was sunk a few days later, public pride in the Royal Navy was severely damaged as a result of the loss of the \"mighty ''Hood''\". \nThe RN carried out a bombardment of Oran in Algeria against the [[French Mediterranean Fleet]]. In the [[attack on Taranto]] torpedo bombers sank three Italian battleships in their naval base at Taranto and in March 1941 it sank three cruisers and two destroyers at [[Cape Matapan]]. The RN carried out an evacuation of troops from Greece to Crete and then from that island. In this the navy lost three cruisers and six destroyers but rescued 30,000 men.\n\nThe RN was vital in interdicting Axis supplies to North Africa and in the resupply of its base in [[Malta]]. The losses in [[Operation Pedestal]] were high but the convoy got through.\n\nThe Royal Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in remote parts of the world such as [[North Africa]], the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Far East]]. Convoys were used from the start of the war and anti-submarine hunting patrols used. From 1942, responsibility for the protection of Atlantic convoys was divided between the various allied navies: the Royal Navy being responsible for much of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. Suppression of the [[U-boat]] threat was an essential requirement for the invasion of northern Europe: the necessary armies could not otherwise be transported and resupplied. During this period the Royal Navy acquired many relatively cheap and quickly built escort vessels.\n\nThe defence of the ports and harbours and keeping sea-lanes around the coast open was the responsibility of [[British Coastal Forces of World War II|Coastal Forces]] and the [[Royal Naval Patrol Service]].\n\n[[Image:Lci-convoy.jpg|thumb|left|Landing craft convoy crossing the [[English Channel]] in 1944]]Naval supremacy was vital to the amphibious operations carried out, such as the invasions of Northwest Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), Sicily, Italy, and Normandy ([[Operation Overlord]]). For [[Operation Neptune]] the RN and RCN supplied 958 of the 1213 warships and three quarters of the 4000 landing craft. The use of the [[Mulberry harbour]]s allowed the invasion forces to be kept resupplied. There were also landings in the south of France in August.\n\nDuring the war however, it became clear that [[aircraft carriers]] were the new capital ship of [[naval warfare]], and that Britain's former naval superiority in terms of battleships had become irrelevant. Britain was an early innovator in aircraft carrier design, introducing armoured flight decks, in place of the now obsolete and vulnerable battleship. The Royal Navy was now dwarfed by its ally, the United States Navy. The successful invasion of Europe reduced the European role of the navy to escorting convoys and providing fire support for troops near the coast as at [[Walcheren]], during the [[battle of the Scheldt]].\n\nThe British Eastern Fleet had been withdrawn to East Africa because of Japanese incursions into the Indian Ocean. Despite opposition from the U.S. naval chief, Admiral [[Ernest King]], the Royal Navy sent a large task force to the Pacific ([[British Pacific Fleet]]). This required the use of wholly different techniques, requiring a substantial fleet support train, resupply at sea and an emphasis on naval air power and defence. In 1945 84 warships and support vessels were sent to the Pacific. It remains the largest foreign deployment of the Royal Navy. Their largest attack was on the oil refineries in Sumatra to deny Japanese access to supplies. However it also gave cover to the US landings on Okinawa and carried out air attacks and bombardment of the Japanese mainland.\n\nAt the start of the Second World War the RN had 15 battleships and battlecruisers with five more battleships under construction, and 66 cruisers with another 23 under construction. To 184 destroyers with 52 more under construction a further 50 old destroyers (and other smaller craft) were obtained from the US in exchange for US access to bases in British territories ([[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]). There were 60 submarines and seven aircraft carriers with more of both under construction.<ref name=naval-history>[http://naval-history.net/WW2CampaignRoyalNavy.htm \"British and Commonwealth Navies at the Beginning and End of World War 2\"]  naval-history.net</ref> At the end the RN had 16 battleships, 52 carriers&mdash;though most of these were small escort or [[Merchant aircraft carrier|merchant carriers]]&mdash;62 cruisers, 257 destroyers, 131 submarines and 9,000 other ships. During the war the Royal Navy lost 278 major warships<ref name=naval-history /> and more than 1,000 small ones. There were 200,000 men (including reserves and marines) in the navy at the start of the war, which rose to 939,000 by the end. 51,000 RN sailors were killed and a further 30,000 from the merchant services.<ref name=naval-history /> The WRNS was reactivated in 1938 and their numbers rose to a peak of 74,000 in 1944. The Royal Marines reached a maximum of 78,000 in 1945, having taken part in all the major landings.\n\n====Norway campaign, 1940====\n{{Main|Norwegian Campaign|Operation Weser\u00fcbung}}\nFinland's defensive war against the Soviet invasion, lasting November 1939 to March 1940, came at a time when there was a lack of large scale military action on the continent called the \"[[Phony War]]\". Attention turned to the Nordic theater. After months of planning at the highest civilian, military and diplomatic levels in London and Paris, in spring, 1940, a series of decisions were made that would involve uninvited invasions of Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark's Faroe Islands, with the goals of damaging the German war economy and assisting Finland in its war with the Soviet Union. An allied war against the Soviet Union was part of the plan. The main naval launching point would be Royal Navy's base at [[Scapa Flow]] in the Orkney Islands.<ref>J. R. M. Butler, ''History of Second World War: Grand strategy, volume 2: September 1939-June 1941'' (1957) pp. 91-150. [https://archive.org/details/grandstrategy02butl online free]</ref>  The Soviet invasion of Finland excited widespread outrage at popular and elite levels in support of Finland not only in wartime Britain and France but also in neutral United States.  The League of Nations declared the USSR was the aggressor and expelled it.<ref>Butler,  p 96</ref>  \"American opinion makers treated the attack on Finland as dastardly aggression worthy of daily headlines, which thereafter exacerbated attitudes toward Russia.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ralph B.

The British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated that the project against Norway would be likely to cause \"An extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output...[and the Swedish component] might well bring German industry to a standstill and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of the war.\"<ref>Butler, p 97</ref>   The idea was to shift forces away from doing little on the static Western front into an active role on a new front. The British military leadership by December became enthusiastic supporters when they realized that their first choice, an attack on German oil supplies, would not get approval. [[Winston Churchill]], now head of the Admiralty, pushed hard for an invasion of Norway and Sweden to help the Finns and cut the iron supplies. Likewise the political and military leaders in Paris strongly supported the plan, because it would put their troops in action. The poor performance of the Soviet army against the Finns strengthened the confidence of the Allies that the invasion, and the resulting war with Russia, would be worthwhile. However the civilian leadership of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government in London drew back and postponed invasion plans. Neutral Norway and Sweden refused to cooperate.<ref>Erin Redihan, \"Neville Chamberlain and Norway: The Trouble with 'A Man of Peace' in a Time of War.\" ''New England Journal of History'' (2013) 69#1/2 pp 1-18.</ref> Finland hoped for Allied intervention but its position became increasingly hopeless; its agreement to an armistice on March 13 signalled defeat.

The Germans had the soldiers and the small boats in place, and had far more in the way of tanks and artillery than the British had after their retreat from Dunkirk. However, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force were fully prepared, and historians believe that an attempted invasion would be a disaster for the Germans. British naval power, based in Scotland, was very well-equipped with heavily armored battleships; Germany had none available. At no point did Germany have the necessary air superiority. And even if they had achieved air superiority, it would have been meaningless on bad weather days, which would ground warplanes but not hinder the Royal Navy from demolishing the transports and blasting the landing fields.<ref>Mark Simmons, \"The planned 1940 sea invasion of Britain, Operation Sea Lion, remains one of the great 'what-ifs' of modern military history,\" ''Military Heritage'' (2013) 15#1 pp 16-19.</ref>  The German general [[Alfred Jodl]] realized that as long as the British navy was a factor, an invasion would be to send \"my troops into a mincing machine.\"<ref>quoted in Brian James, \"Pie in the Sky?\" ''History Today'' (Sept 2006) 56#9</ref>\n\n====Collaboration====\nWith a wide range of nations collaborating with the Allies, the British needed a way to coordinate the work.

It was well behind the British in the latest technology, such as radar, which was essential for night gunnery at long range. The ''Regia Marina'' had six battleships, 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Two aircraft carriers were under construction; they were never launched. The nation was too poor to launch a major shipbuilding campaign, which made the senior commanders cautious for fear of losing assets that could not be replaced. In the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] the British had broken the Italian naval code and knew the times of departure, routing, time of arrival and make up of convoys. The Italians neglected to capture Malta, which became the main staging and logistical base for the British.\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II}}\n\n====Strength====\nOn 7 December 1941, the principal units of the Japanese Navy included:<ref>S.W.

There were also 520 flying boats used for reconnaissance.<ref>Roskill, ''The War at Sea 1939-1945; Volume II: The Period of Balance'' (1956) p 480</ref>\n\n====1942 IJN Operation====\nIn the six months following Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto's carrier-based fleet engaged in multiple operations ranging from raids on Ceylon in the Indian Ocean to an attempted conquest of Midway Island, west of Hawaii. His actions were largely successful in defeating American, British and Dutch naval forces, although The American fleet held at the battle of Coral Sea, and inflicted a decisive defeat on Yamamoto at Midway.<ref>Hiroyuki Agawa, ''The reluctant admiral: Yamamoto and the Imperial Navy'' (1979) pp 266-302.</ref> [[Guam]] fell in mid-December, and the Philippines were invaded at several points.  Wake Island fell on December 23.  January, 1942 saw the IJN handle invasions of the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Dutch East Indies]], [[New Guinea campaign|Western New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomon Islands]]. IJN built major forward bases at [[Chuuk State|Truk]] and [[Rabaul]].  The Japanese army captured Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. [[Bali]] and [[Timor]] also fell in February. The rapid collapse of Allied resistance had left the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] split in two.  At the [[Battle of the Java Sea]], in late February and early March, the IJN inflicted a resounding defeat on the main ABDA naval force, under the Dutch. The Netherlands East Indies campaign subsequently ended with the surrender of Allied forces on Java.<ref>Paul S.

It was decisively defeated defending the Dutch East Indies in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]]. The battle consisted of a series of attempts over a seven-hour period by Admiral [[Karel Doorman]]'s Combined Striking Force to attack the Japanese invasion convoy; each was rebuffed by the escort force. Doorman went down with his ships together with 1000 of his crew. During the relentless Japanese offensive of February through April 1942 in the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch navy in the Far East was virtually annihilated, and it sustained losses of a total of 20 ships (including its only two light cruisers) and 2500 sailors killed.<ref>{{cite web|last = Klemen |first = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/war_sea.html |title= The War at Sea |date=1999\u20132000 |work= Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref><ref>David Arthur Thomas, ''The battle of the Java sea'' (Deutsch, 1968).</ref>\n\nA small force of Dutch submarines based in Western Australia sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and American navies together, an exploit which earned [[Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich|Admiral Helfrich]] the nickname \"Ship-a-day Helfrich\".<ref name=\"Dutchman\">{{cite news|last = TIME |first = Monday, Feb. 23, 1942 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884450,00.html |title=World Battlefronts: Dutchman's Chance |date= February 23, 1942|work=Time}}</ref>\n\nAround the world Dutch naval units were responsible for transporting troops; for example, during [[Operation Dynamo]] in Dunkirk and on [[D-Day]], they escorted convoys and attacked enemy targets.\n\n===USSR===\n{{main|Soviet Navy#World War II: The Great Patriotic War}}\nBuilding a Soviet fleet was a national priority, but many senior officers were killed in purges in the late 1930s.<ref>J\u00fcrgen Rohwer and Mikhail S.

Two more submarines, ''[[NMS Marsuinul|Marsuinul]]'' and ''[[NMS Marsuinul#Sister ship|Rechinul]]'', were launched a short while prior to Romania's entry into the war, but they were commissioned only in May 1943. Also acquired in 1943 were five Italian [[CB-class midget submarine|CB]]-class midget submarines. By May 1944, two Romanian motor torpedo boats (''[[NMS Viscolul|Viscolul]]'' and ''[[NMS Vedenia|Vedenia]]'') were fitted for escort service.\n\nThe Romanian Navy was the only navy to fight for over three years without losing a single unit of its main force of destroyers and submarines.<ref>Antony Preston, ''Warship 2001\u20132002'', p. 70</ref> At the same time, it caused the [[Romanian Naval Forces#List of enemy warships sunk by the Romanian Navy during World War II|sinking of one destroyer and over a dozen submarines]], all Soviet.\n\n== Battles and campaigns ==\n===Pacific===\n{{main|Pacific War}}\n{{further|South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Asiatic-Pacific Theater}}\n\n====Submarine war in Pacific====\nU.S. Navy submarines (with some aid from the British and Dutch), operating from bases in Australia, Hawaii, and Ceylon, played a major role in defeating Japan. Japanese submarines, however, played a minimal role, although they had the best torpedoes of any nation in World War II, and quite good submarines. The difference in results is due to the very different doctrines of the sides, which, on the Japanese side, were based on cultural traditions.\n\n=====Allied doctrine and equipment=====\n{{Main|Allied submarines in the Pacific War}}\nAllied submarines concentrated on destroying Japanese logistics, for which the island nation depended on shipping. Within hours of Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt ordered a new doctrine into effect: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Axis controlled waters, without warning and without help to survivors.  U.S. torpedoes, the standard issue Mark XIV torpedo and its Mark VI exploder were both defective, problems not corrected until September 1943. Worst of all, before the war, an uninformed [[United States Customs|Customs]] officer had seized a copy of the Japanese merchant marine code (called the \"''maru'' code\" in the USN), not knowing U.S. [[communications intelligence]] had broken it;<ref>Ladislas Farago, ''Broken Seal''.</ref> Japan promptly changed it, and it was not recovered until 1943.\n\nThus it was not until 1944 the U.S. Navy learned to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect: effective shipboard radar installed, commanders seen to be lacking in aggression replaced, and faults in torpedoes fixed.\n\n=====Japanese doctrine and equipment=====\n{{Further|Submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy}}\nFor the Imperial Japanese Navy, however, submarines, as part of the Japanese warrior tradition of [[bushido]], preferred to attack warships rather than transports. Faced with a convoy, an Allied submarine would try to sink the merchant vessels, while their Japanese counterparts would give first priority to the escorts. This was important in 1942, before Allied warship production came up to capacity. So, while the U.S. had an unusually long supply line between its west coast and frontline areas that was vulnerable to submarine attack, Japan's submarines were instead used for long range reconnaissance and to supply food for the scores of thousands of soldiers stranded on strongholds which had been cut off, especially [[Chuuk State|Truk]] and [[Rabaul, battle of|Rabaul]].<ref>Mochisura Hasimoto, ''Sunk; The Story of the Japanese Submarine Fleet, 1941-1945'' (1954).</ref>\n\nSupply runs were a lesser drain on Allied resources. The need to supply MacArthur's forces trapped in the Philippines led to diversion of boats to \"guerrilla submarine\" missions. As well, basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while ''en route'' to patrol areas, inhibiting effectiveness, and Nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of enemy bases. A small number of oversized submarines handled much of the resupply, submarines that were less agile than their sisters attacking escorted convoys.\n\nRequirements of the Japanese Army to supply cut-off garrisons by submarine further reduced the effectiveness of Japanese anti-shipping warfare.<ref>Clay Blair, ''Silent Victory: The U. S. Submarine War Against Japan'' (1975).</ref><ref>Theodore Roscoe, ''United States Submarine Operations in World War II'' (1949).</ref> In addition, Japan honored its neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, and ignored U.S. freighters shipping millions of tons of war supplies from San Francisco over northern routes to Vladivostok.<ref>Carl Boyd, \"The Japanese Submarine Force and the Legacy of Strategic and Operational Doctrine Developed Between the World Wars,\" in Larry Addington ed.

Reynolds, ''Command of the Sea: The History and Strategy of Maritime Empires'' (1974) 512.</ref>\n\nA small number of Allied submarines\u2014less than 2 percent of the fleet tonnage\u2014strangled Japan by sinking its merchant fleet, intercepting many troop transports, and cutting off nearly all the oil imports that were essential to warfare. By early 1945 the oil tanks were dry.<ref>Submariners systematically avoided publicity, in order to encourage enemy overconfidence. Japan thought its defensive techniques sank 468 American subs; the true figure was only 42. (Ten others went down in accidents, the Atlantic Ocean, or as the result of friendly fire.) Submarines also rescued hundreds of downed fliers, most famously [[George H. W. Bush]].</ref>\n\n=====Results=====\nThe Japanese commercial fleet was 6.4 million tons in December 1941; during the war 3.9 million tons of new shipping was built. Japanese merchant losses came to 8.9 million tons, leaving 1.5 million tons afloat at the end of the war.<ref>Mark P. Parillo, ''The Japanese Merchant Marine in World War II'' (Naval Institute Press, 1993) p 242.</ref>  Although estimates differ, U.S. submarines alone probably accounted for 56% of the Japanese merchantmen sunk; most of the rest were hit by planes at the end of the war, or were destroyed by mines. U.S. submariners also claimed 28% of Japanese warships destroyed.<ref name=\"UsSubs\">Larry Kimmett and Margaret Regis, [http://www.navpublishing.com/subtour1.htm U.S. Submarines in World War II]</ref> Furthermore, they played important reconnaissance roles, as at the battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, when they gave accurate and timely warning of the approach of the Japanese fleet. Submarines operated from secure bases in Fremantle, Australia; Pearl Harbor; [[Trincomalee]], Ceylon; and later Guam. These had to be protected by surface fleets and aircraft.\n\nJapanese anti-submarine practices were careless and badly managed.<ref>Chihaya Masataka, \"An Intimate Look at the Japanese Navy,\" in Donald M. Goldstein, and Katherine V. Dillon, eds., ''Pearl Harbor Papers'' (1993), p. 323.</ref>  Japanese convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to Allied ones, a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training. The number of U.S. submarines on patrol at any one time increased from 13 in 1942, to 18 in 1943, to 43 in late 1944. Half of their kills came in 1944, when over 200 subs were operating.<ref name=\"UsSubs\"/> By 1945, patrols had decreased because so few targets dared to move on the high seas. In all, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships. Most were small cargo carriers, but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies. Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports. At critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan, and Leyte campaigns, thousands of Japanese troops were killed before they could be landed. Over 200 warships were sunk, ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to eight carriers and one battleship.\n\nUnderwater warfare was especially dangerous for the submarine crews.  The U.S. submarine service included only 1.6% of Navy personnel or 50,000 men. Most were shore based.  Of the 16,000 who went out on patrol, 3,500 (22%) never returned, the highest casualty rate of any American force in World War II.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joel Ira Holwitt|title=\"Execute against Japan\": The U.S. Decision to Conduct Unrestricted Submarine Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrhBItGMEH4C&pg=PA168|year=2009|publisher=Texas A&M UP|page=168}}</ref> The Japanese losses were even worse.\n\n===Atlantic===\n* [[Baltic Sea campaigns (1939\u201345)]]\n* [[Battle of the Atlantic]]\n* [[Commerce raiding]]\n* [[Merchant raiders]]\n* [[Operation Sea Lion]]\n* [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]\n* [[Black Sea Campaigns (1941\u201344)]]\n** [[Romanian Navy during World War II]]\n\n=== Mediterranean ===\n{{main|Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War II)|Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II}}\n\nWhile the Royal Navy spent a great deal of energy dealing with German surface and submarine attacks on its merchant marine, it also launched its own attack on Axis shipping, especially in the Mediterranean.

It also played a major supporting role, alongside the Royal Navy, in the European war against Germany.\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II|Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) sought naval superiority in the Pacific by sinking the main American battle fleet at Pearl Harbor, which was built around its battleships. The December 1941 surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] did knock out the battle fleet, but it did not touch the aircraft carriers, which became the mainstay of the rebuilt fleet.\n\nNaval doctrine had to be changed overnight. The United States Navy (like the IJN) had followed [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Thayer Mahan's]] emphasis on concentrated groups of battleships as the main offensive naval weapons.<ref>Trent Hone, \"The Evolution of Fleet Tactical Doctrine in the U.S. Navy, 1922-1941,\" ''Journal of Military History'' (2003) 67#4 pp. 1107-1148 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3396884 in JSTOR]</ref> The loss of the battleships at Pearl Harbor forced Admiral [[Ernest J.

It assumed that the United States was allied with Britain and France and provided for offensive operations by American forces in Europe, Africa, or both.  The assumptions and plans for Rainbow 5 were discussed extensively in the [[Plan Dog memo]], which concluded ultimately that the United States would adhere to a [[Europe first]] strategy, making the war against Germany a higher priority than the war against Japan.  However President Roosevelt did not approve the plan\u2014he wanted to play it by ear.<ref>{{cite book|author=George W.

Stoler, \"The 'Pacific-First' Alternative in American World War II Strategy.\" ''International History Review'' 2#3 (1980): 432-452.</ref>\n\nU.S. strategy in 1941 was to deter Japan from further advances toward British, Dutch, French and American territories to the South.  When the Allies cut off sales of oil to Japan, it lost 90% of its fuel supply for airplanes and warships.  It had stocks that would last a year or two.  It had to compromise or fight to recapture British and Dutch wells to the South.  in November 1941, U.S. Army Chief of Staff [[George Marshall]] explained the American air war strategy to the press\u2014it was top secret and not for publication:\n:We are preparing for an offensive war against Japan, whereas the Japs believe we are preparing only to defend the Philippines. ...We have 35 Flying Fortresses already there\u2014the largest concentration anywhere in the world. Twenty more will be added next month, and 60 more in January....If war with the Japanese does come, we'll fight mercilessly. Flying fortresses will be dispatched immediately to set the paper cities of Japan on fire. There won't be any hesitation about bombing civilians\u2014it will be all-out.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCormack|title=Japan at War 1931\u201345: As the Cherry Blossom Falls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9jyDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT136|year=2017|page=136}}</ref>\n\nMarshall was talking about long-range B-17 bombers based in the Philippines, which were within range of Tokyo. After Japan captured the Philippines in early 1942, American strategy refocused on a naval war focusing on the capture of islands close enough for the intensive bombing campaign Marshall spoke about. In 1944, the Navy captured [[Saipan]] and the Mariana Islands, which were within range of the new B-29 bombers.\n\nAfter its Pearl Harbor victory in early December the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) seemed unstoppable because it outnumbered and outgunned the disorganized Allies\u2014US, Britain, Netherlands, Australia, China. London and Washington both believed in Mahanian doctrine, which stressed the need for a unified fleet. However, in contrast to the cooperation achieved by the armies, the Allied navies failed to combine or even coordinate their activities until mid-1942. Tokyo also believed in [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], who said command of the seas\u2014achieved by great fleet battles\u2014was the key to sea power. Therefore, the IJN kept its main strike force together under Admiral Yamamoto and won a series of stunning victories over the Americans and British in the 90 days after Pearl Harbor.\n\nOutgunned at sea, with its big guns lying at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, the American strategy for victory required a slow retreat or holding action against the IJN until the much greater industrial potential of the US could be mobilized to launch a fleet capable of projecting Allied power to the enemy heartland.\n\n====Midway====\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\nThe Battle of Midway, together with the Guadalcanal campaign, marked the turning point in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-1.htm |title=Battle of Midway: June&nbsp;4\u20137,1942 |publisher=Naval History & Heritage Command |date=27 April 2005 |accessdate=20 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090302032014/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-1.htm| archivedate= 2 March 2009 | url-status= live}} \"...considered the decisive battle of the war in the Pacific.\"</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Dull | first=Paul S | title=Battle History of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1941\u20131945 | date= | publisher=US Naval Institute Press |isbn=1-59114-219-9 | pages=}} \"Midway ''was'' indeed \"the\" decisive battle of the war in the Pacific.\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SLfti-Dc1AcC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=Midway+decisive+battle&source=bl&ots=wRGD-EQNKv&sig=Qx7UryTe62zBfpbra_SQBu6w2mk&hl=en&ei=B6-gSbTqE5HItQO3-ajdCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA166,M1 p. 166]</ref><ref name=\"Midway Decisive\">{{Cite web| last = | first = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612040835/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | archivedate = 12 June 2007 | title = A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers: Battle of Midway | work = | publisher = U.S. Navy | accessdate = 12 June 2007}}</ref> Between June 4\u20137, 1942, the [[United States Navy]] decisively defeated a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese naval force]] that had sought to lure the U.S. carrier fleet into a trap at [[Midway Atoll]]. The Japanese fleet lost four aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser to the U.S. Navy's [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|one American carrier]] and a [[destroyer]]. After Midway, and the exhausting attrition of the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], Japan's shipbuilding and pilot training programs were unable to keep pace in replacing their losses while the U.S. steadily increased its output in both areas. Military historian [[John Keegan]] called the Battle of Midway \"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\"<ref>Keegan, John. \"The Second World War.\" New York: Penguin, 2005. (275)</ref>\n\n====Guadalcanal====\n{{Main|Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nGuadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943,  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign saw American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders) in a six months campaign slowly overwhelm determined Japanese resistance. Guadalcanal was the key to control the [[Solomon Islands]], which both sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines.\n\nThe rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides dividing the victories. They were: [[Battle of Savo Island]], [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], [[Battle of Cape Esperance]], [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] and [[Battle of Rennell Island]]. Both sides pulled out their aircraft carriers, as they were too vulnerable to land-based aviation.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942-February 1943'' (1949)</ref>\n\n====1943====\nIn preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Navy started the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Enormous effort went into recruiting and training sailors and Marines, and building warships, warplanes and support ships in preparation for a thrust across the Pacific, and to support Army operations in the Southwest Pacific, as well as in Europe and North Africa.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''A Companion to American Military History'' (2010) 1: 205-7, 402-3</ref>\n\n====1944====\nThe Navy continued its long movement west across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured; some, like the big bases at Truk, Rabaul and Formosa were neutralized by air attack and then simply leapfrogged. The ultimate goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks and finally an invasion. The US Navy did not seek out the Japanese fleet for a decisive battle, as [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahanian]] doctrine would suggest; the enemy had to attack to stop the inexorable advance.\n\nThe climax of the carrier war came at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref>William T. Y'Blood, ''Red Sun Setting: The Battle of the Philippine Sea'' (2003)</ref> Taking control of islands that could support airfields within B-29 range of Tokyo was the objective. 535 ships began landing 128,000 Army and Marine invaders on June 15, 1944, in the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana and Palau Islands]]. The Japanese launched an ill-coordinated attack on the larger American fleet; its planes operated at extreme ranges and could not keep together, allowing them to be easily shot down in what Americans jokingly called the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.\"<ref>Barrett Tillman, ''Clash of the Carriers: The True Story of the Marianas Turkey Shoot of World War II'' (2005)</ref> \nJapan had now lost most of its offensive capabilities, and the U.S. had air bases on Guam, Saipan and Tinian for B-29 bombers targeted at Japan's home islands.\n\nThe final act of 1944 was the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the last naval battle in history in which the battle line of one navy \"crossed the T\" of the battle line of its enemy, enabling the crossing line to fire the full broadsides of its main batteries as against only the forward guns of only the enemy's lead ship.  The Japanese plan was to lure the main body of the U.S. fleet away from the action at Leyte Gulf by decoying it with a dummy fleet far to the north, and then to close in on the U.S. Army and Marines landing at Leyte with a pincer movement of two squadrons of battleships, and annihilate them.  The movements of these Japanese fleet components were terribly uncoordinated, resulting in piecemeal slaughter of Japanese fleet units in the Sibuyan Sea and the Surigao Strait (where \"the T was crossed\"), but, although the ruse to lure the main body of the U.S. fleet away had worked to perfection, the Japanese were unaware of this, with the result that an overwhelmingly superior remaining force of Japanese battleships and cruisers that massively outnumbered and outgunned the few U.S. fleet units left behind at Leyte, thinking it was sailing into the jaws of the more powerful U.S. main body, turned tail and ran away without exploiting its hard-won advantage.  After which Japan had now lost all its offensive naval capability.\n\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku and two destroyers under attack on 20 June 1944 (80-G-238025).jpg|300px|thumb|The carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] (center) and two destroyers under attack June 20, 1944]]\n\n====Okinawa 1945====\n{{Main|Battle of Okinawa}}\nOkinawa was the last great battle of the entire war. The goal was to make the island into a staging area for the [[invasion of Japan]] scheduled for fall 1945. It was just 350 miles (550&nbsp;km) south of the Japanese home islands. Marines and soldiers landed on 1 April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans losing their lives. Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilots exacted the largest loss of ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000 wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 men. The fierce combat and high American losses led the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the [[atomic bomb]] to induce surrender.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to World War II'' (2002) p 279</ref>\n\n====Naval technology: US vs Japan====\nTechnology and industrial power proved decisive. Japan failed to exploit its early successes before the immense potential power of the Allies could be brought to bear. In 1941 the Japanese [[Zero fighter]] had a longer range and better performance than rival American warplanes, and the pilots had more experience in the air.<ref>Robert Jackson, ''Mitsubishi Zero'' (2005)</ref>  But Japan never improved the Zero and by 1944 the Allied navies were far ahead of Japan in both quantity and quality, and ahead of Germany in quantity and in putting advanced technology to practical use. High tech innovations arrived with dizzying rapidity. Entirely new weapons systems were invented\u2014like the landing ships,  such as the 3,000-ton LST (\"[[Landing Ship, Tank]]\") that carried 25 tanks thousands of miles and landed them right on the assault beaches. Furthermore, older weapons systems were constantly upgraded and improved. Obsolescent airplanes, for example, received more powerful engines and more sensitive radar sets. One impediment to progress was that admirals who had grown up with great battleships and fast cruisers had a hard time adjusting their war-fighting doctrines to incorporate the capability and flexibility of the rapidly evolving new weapons systems.\n\n====Ships====\nThe ships of the American and Japanese forces were closely matched at the beginning of the war. By 1943 the American qualitative edge was winning battles; by 1944 the American quantitative advantage made the Japanese position hopeless. The German navy, distrusting its Japanese ally, ignored Hitler's orders to cooperate and failed to share its expertise in radar and radio. Thus the Imperial Navy was further handicapped in the technological race with the Allies (who did cooperate with each other). The United States economic base was ten times larger than Japan's, and its technological capabilities also significantly greater, and it mobilized engineering skills much more effectively than Japan, so that technological advances came faster and were applied more effectively to weapons. Above all, American admirals adjusted their doctrines of naval warfare to exploit the advantages. The quality and performance of the warships of Japan were initially comparable to those of the US.\n\nThe Americans were supremely, and perhaps overly, confident in 1941. Pacific commander Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] boasted he could beat a bigger fleet because of \"...our superior personnel in resourcefulness and initiative, and the undoubted superiority of much of our equipment.\" As Willmott notes, it was a dangerous and ill-founded assumption.<ref>Quoted in H. P. Willmott, ''The barrier and the javelin: Japanese and Allied Pacific strategies, February to June 1942'' (Naval Institute Press, 1983) p 198</ref> Nimitz would later make good on his boast by defeating a larger Japanese force in the [[Battle of Midway]] and turning the tide in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Keegan 2005, p. 275</ref>\n\n====Battleships====\nThe American battleships before Pearl Harbor could fire salvos of nine 2,100-pound armor-piercing shells every minute to a range of 35,000 yards (19 miles). No ship except another battleship had the thick armor that could withstand that kind of firepower. When intelligence reported that Japan had secretly built even more powerful battleships, Washington responded with four ''Iowa''-class battleships. The \"big-gun\" admirals on both sides dreamed of a great shootout at twenty-mile (32&nbsp;km) range, in which carrier planes would be used only for spotting the mighty guns. Their doctrine was utterly out of date. A plane like the Grumman TBF Avenger could drop a 2,000-pound bomb on a battleship at a range of hundreds of miles. An aircraft carrier cost less, required about the same number of personnel, was just as fast, and could easily sink a battleship. During the war the battleships found new missions: they were platforms holding all together dozens of anti-aircraft guns and eight or nine 14-inch or 16-inch long-range guns used to blast land targets before amphibious landings. Their smaller 5-inch guns, and the 4,800 3-inch to 8-inch guns on cruisers and destroyers also proved effective at bombarding landing zones. After a short bombardment of Tarawa island in November 1943, Marines discovered that the Japanese defenders were surviving in underground shelters. It then became routine doctrine to thoroughly work over beaches with thousands of high-explosive and armor-piercing shells. The bombardment would destroy some fixed emplacements and kill some troops. More important, it severed communication lines, stunned and demoralized the defenders, and gave the landing parties fresh confidence. After the landing, naval gunfire directed by ground observers would target any enemy pillboxes that were still operational. The sinking of the battleships at Pearl Harbor proved a blessing in deep disguise, for after they were resurrected and assigned their new mission they performed well. (Absent Pearl Harbor, big-gun admirals like [[Raymond Spruance]] might have followed prewar doctrine and sought a surface battle in which the Japanese would have been very hard to defeat.)<ref>Christopher Chant, ''An Illustrated Data Guide to Battleships of World War II'' (1997)</ref>\n\n====Naval aviation====\nIn World War I the US Navy explored aviation, both land-based and carrier based. However, the Navy nearly abolished aviation in 1919 when Admiral [[William S. Benson]], the reactionary Chief of Naval Operations, could not \"conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation\", and he secretly tried to abolish the Navy's Aviation Division.<ref>Jeffery S. Underwood, ''The wings of democracy: the influence of air power on the Roosevelt Administration, 1933-1941'' (1991) p. 11</ref> Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed the decision because he believed aviation might someday be \"the principal factor\" at sea with missions to bomb enemy warships, scout enemy fleets, map minefields, and escort convoys. Grudgingly allowing it a minor mission, the Navy slowly built up its aviation. In 1929 it had one carrier ({{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}}), 500 pilots and 900 planes; by 1937 it had 5 carriers (the {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, ''Ranger'', {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}), 2000 pilots and 1000 much better planes. With Roosevelt now in the White House, the tempo soon quickened. One of the main relief agencies, the [[Public Works Administration|PWA]], made building warships a priority. In 1941 the U.S. Navy with 8 carriers, 4,500 pilots and 3,400 planes had more air power than the Japanese Navy.<ref>Jeffery S. Underwood, ''The wings of democracy''</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n{{main|Kriegsmarine}}\n\n==== Submarines ====\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0952-17, Frankreich, Auszeichnungen f\u00fcr U-99-Besatzung.jpg|thumb|[[Otto Kretschmer]] (left) was the [[List of successful U-boat commanders|most successful]] German U-boat commander in the World War II]]\nGermany's main naval weapon was the U-boat; its main mission was to cut off the flow of supplies and munitions reaching Britain by sea. Submarine attacks on Britain's vital maritime supply routes in the \"[[Battle of the Atlantic]]\" started immediately at the outbreak of war. Although they were hampered initially by the lack of well placed ports from which to operate; that changed when France fell in 1940 and Germany took control of all the ports in France and the Low Countries. The U-boats had such a high success rate at first, that the period to early 1941 was known as the [[First Happy Time]]. The ''Kriegsmarine'' was responsible for [[coastal artillery]] protecting major ports and possible invasion points, and also handled anti-aircraft batteries protecting major ports.<ref name = \"Feldgrau38\">[http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=38 Organization of the Kriegsmarine in the West 1940\u20131945] Feldgrau.com</ref>\n\nIn 1939\u20131945 German shipyards launched 1,162 U-boats, of which 785 were destroyed during the war (632 at sea) along with 30,000 crew. The British anti-submarine ships and aircraft accounted for over 500 kills. At the end of the war, 156 U-boats surrendered to the Allies, while the crews scuttled 221 others, chiefly in German ports. In terms of effectiveness, German and other Axis submarines sank 2828 merchant ships totaling 14.7 million tons (11.7 million British); many more were damaged. The use of convoys dramatically reduced the number of sinkings, but convoys made for slow movement and long delays at both ends, and thus reduced the flow of Allied goods. German submarines also sank 175 Allied warships, mostly British, with 52,000 Royal Navy sailors killed.<ref>S.W. Roskill, ''White Ensign: The British Navy at War 1939-1945'' (1960) pp 422-23</ref>\n\n====Surface fleet====\n{{Main|Baltic Sea campaigns (1939\u201345)|Battle of the Atlantic|Commerce raiding|Merchant raiders|Operation Sea Lion|Battle of the Mediterranean|Black Sea campaigns (1941\u201344)}}\nThe German fleet was involved in many operations, starting with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]]. Also in 1939, it sank the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}} and the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|6}}, while losing the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} at the [[Battle of the River Plate]].\n\nIn April 1940, the German navy was heavily involved in the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]], where it lost the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}}, two light cruisers, and ten destroyers. In return it sank the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}} and some smaller ships.\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{main|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|History of the Royal Navy#Second World War}}\nThe Royal Navy in the critical years 1939\u201343 was under the command of [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral [[Dudley Pound|Sir Dudley Pound]] (1877\u20131943). \nAs a result of the earlier changes the Royal Navy entered the [[Second World War]] as a heterogeneous force of World War I veterans, inter-war ships limited by close adherence to treaty restrictions and later unrestricted designs.though smaller and relatively older than it was during World War I, it remained the major naval power up until 1944-45 when it was overtaken by the American navy.\n\nAt the start of World War II, Britain's global commitments were reflected in the Navy's deployment. Its first task remained the protection of trade, since Britain was heavily dependent upon imports of food and raw materials, and the global empire was also interdependent. The navy's assets were allocated between various fleets and stations.<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/#WW2 Royal Navy in World War 2]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!  Fleet / station\n!

His greatest achievement was his successful campaign against German [[U-boat]] activity and the winning of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. [[Winston Churchill]], the civilian head of the Navy (1939\u201340) and of all the forces as Prime Minister (1940\u201345) worked with him closely on naval strategies; he was dubbed \"Churchill's anchor\".<ref>Tony Heathcote, ''The British Admirals of the Fleet 1734 \u2013 1995'' (2002). p 217</ref>  He blocked Churchill's scheme of sending a battle fleet into the Baltic early in the war. However his judgment has been challenged regarding his micromanagement, the failed [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940, his dismissal of [[Dudley North (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Dudley North]] in 1940, Japan's sinking of the [[HMS Repulse (1916)|''Repulse'']] and the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|''Prince of Wales'']] by air attack off Malaya in late 1941, and the failure in July 1942 to disperse [[Convoy PQ 17]] under German attack.<ref>Peter Nailor, \"Great Chiefs of Staff - Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, OM, GCB GCVO,\" ''RUSI Journal'', Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies (1988) Volume 133 Number 1 pp 67-70.</ref>\n\n[[Image:British Battlecruiser HMS Hood circa 1932.jpg|thumb|left|British battlecruiser HMS ''Hood'']]\nDuring the early phases of [[World War II]], the Royal Navy provided critical cover during British evacuations from Norway (where an aircraft carrier and 6 destroyers were lost but 338,000 men were evacuated), [[Operation Dynamo|from Dunkirk]] (where 7,000 RN men were killed) and at the [[Battle of Crete]]. In the latter operation [[Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]] ran great risks to extract the Army, and saved many men to fight another day. The prestige of the Navy suffered a severe blow when the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']]  was sunk by the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941. Although the ''Bismarck'' was sunk a few days later, public pride in the Royal Navy was severely damaged as a result of the loss of the \"mighty ''Hood''\". \nThe RN carried out a bombardment of Oran in Algeria against the [[French Mediterranean Fleet]]. In the [[attack on Taranto]] torpedo bombers sank three Italian battleships in their naval base at Taranto and in March 1941 it sank three cruisers and two destroyers at [[Cape Matapan]]. The RN carried out an evacuation of troops from Greece to Crete and then from that island. In this the navy lost three cruisers and six destroyers but rescued 30,000 men.\n\nThe RN was vital in interdicting Axis supplies to North Africa and in the resupply of its base in [[Malta]]. The losses in [[Operation Pedestal]] were high but the convoy got through.\n\nThe Royal Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in remote parts of the world such as [[North Africa]], the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Far East]]. Convoys were used from the start of the war and anti-submarine hunting patrols used. From 1942, responsibility for the protection of Atlantic convoys was divided between the various allied navies: the Royal Navy being responsible for much of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. Suppression of the [[U-boat]] threat was an essential requirement for the invasion of northern Europe: the necessary armies could not otherwise be transported and resupplied. During this period the Royal Navy acquired many relatively cheap and quickly built escort vessels.\n\nThe defence of the ports and harbours and keeping sea-lanes around the coast open was the responsibility of [[British Coastal Forces of World War II|Coastal Forces]] and the [[Royal Naval Patrol Service]].\n\n[[Image:Lci-convoy.jpg|thumb|left|Landing craft convoy crossing the [[English Channel]] in 1944]]Naval supremacy was vital to the amphibious operations carried out, such as the invasions of Northwest Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), Sicily, Italy, and Normandy ([[Operation Overlord]]). For [[Operation Neptune]] the RN and RCN supplied 958 of the 1213 warships and three quarters of the 4000 landing craft. The use of the [[Mulberry harbour]]s allowed the invasion forces to be kept resupplied. There were also landings in the south of France in August.\n\nDuring the war however, it became clear that [[aircraft carriers]] were the new capital ship of [[naval warfare]], and that Britain's former naval superiority in terms of battleships had become irrelevant. Britain was an early innovator in aircraft carrier design, introducing armoured flight decks, in place of the now obsolete and vulnerable battleship. The Royal Navy was now dwarfed by its ally, the United States Navy. The successful invasion of Europe reduced the European role of the navy to escorting convoys and providing fire support for troops near the coast as at [[Walcheren]], during the [[battle of the Scheldt]].\n\nThe British Eastern Fleet had been withdrawn to East Africa because of Japanese incursions into the Indian Ocean. Despite opposition from the U.S. naval chief, Admiral [[Ernest King]], the Royal Navy sent a large task force to the Pacific ([[British Pacific Fleet]]). This required the use of wholly different techniques, requiring a substantial fleet support train, resupply at sea and an emphasis on naval air power and defence. In 1945 84 warships and support vessels were sent to the Pacific. It remains the largest foreign deployment of the Royal Navy. Their largest attack was on the oil refineries in Sumatra to deny Japanese access to supplies. However it also gave cover to the US landings on Okinawa and carried out air attacks and bombardment of the Japanese mainland.\n\nAt the start of the Second World War the RN had 15 battleships and battlecruisers with five more battleships under construction, and 66 cruisers with another 23 under construction. To 184 destroyers with 52 more under construction a further 50 old destroyers (and other smaller craft) were obtained from the US in exchange for US access to bases in British territories ([[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]). There were 60 submarines and seven aircraft carriers with more of both under construction.<ref name=naval-history>[http://naval-history.net/WW2CampaignRoyalNavy.htm \"British and Commonwealth Navies at the Beginning and End of World War 2\"]  naval-history.net</ref> At the end the RN had 16 battleships, 52 carriers&mdash;though most of these were small escort or [[Merchant aircraft carrier|merchant carriers]]&mdash;62 cruisers, 257 destroyers, 131 submarines and 9,000 other ships. During the war the Royal Navy lost 278 major warships<ref name=naval-history /> and more than 1,000 small ones. There were 200,000 men (including reserves and marines) in the navy at the start of the war, which rose to 939,000 by the end. 51,000 RN sailors were killed and a further 30,000 from the merchant services.<ref name=naval-history /> The WRNS was reactivated in 1938 and their numbers rose to a peak of 74,000 in 1944. The Royal Marines reached a maximum of 78,000 in 1945, having taken part in all the major landings.\n\n====Norway campaign, 1940====\n{{Main|Norwegian Campaign|Operation Weser\u00fcbung}}\nFinland's defensive war against the Soviet invasion, lasting November 1939 to March 1940, came at a time when there was a lack of large scale military action on the continent called the \"[[Phony War]]\". Attention turned to the Nordic theater. After months of planning at the highest civilian, military and diplomatic levels in London and Paris, in spring, 1940, a series of decisions were made that would involve uninvited invasions of Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark's Faroe Islands, with the goals of damaging the German war economy and assisting Finland in its war with the Soviet Union. An allied war against the Soviet Union was part of the plan. The main naval launching point would be Royal Navy's base at [[Scapa Flow]] in the Orkney Islands.<ref>J. R. M. Butler, ''History of Second World War: Grand strategy, volume 2: September 1939-June 1941'' (1957) pp. 91-150. [https://archive.org/details/grandstrategy02butl online free]</ref>  The Soviet invasion of Finland excited widespread outrage at popular and elite levels in support of Finland not only in wartime Britain and France but also in neutral United States.  The League of Nations declared the USSR was the aggressor and expelled it.<ref>Butler,  p 96</ref>  \"American opinion makers treated the attack on Finland as dastardly aggression worthy of daily headlines, which thereafter exacerbated attitudes toward Russia.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ralph B.

The British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated that the project against Norway would be likely to cause \"An extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output...[and the Swedish component] might well bring German industry to a standstill and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of the war.\"<ref>Butler, p 97</ref>   The idea was to shift forces away from doing little on the static Western front into an active role on a new front. The British military leadership by December became enthusiastic supporters when they realized that their first choice, an attack on German oil supplies, would not get approval. [[Winston Churchill]], now head of the Admiralty, pushed hard for an invasion of Norway and Sweden to help the Finns and cut the iron supplies. Likewise the political and military leaders in Paris strongly supported the plan, because it would put their troops in action. The poor performance of the Soviet army against the Finns strengthened the confidence of the Allies that the invasion, and the resulting war with Russia, would be worthwhile. However the civilian leadership of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government in London drew back and postponed invasion plans. Neutral Norway and Sweden refused to cooperate.<ref>Erin Redihan, \"Neville Chamberlain and Norway: The Trouble with 'A Man of Peace' in a Time of War.\" ''New England Journal of History'' (2013) 69#1/2 pp 1-18.</ref> Finland hoped for Allied intervention but its position became increasingly hopeless; its agreement to an armistice on March 13 signalled defeat.

The Germans had the soldiers and the small boats in place, and had far more in the way of tanks and artillery than the British had after their retreat from Dunkirk. However, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force were fully prepared, and historians believe that an attempted invasion would be a disaster for the Germans. British naval power, based in Scotland, was very well-equipped with heavily armored battleships; Germany had none available. At no point did Germany have the necessary air superiority. And even if they had achieved air superiority, it would have been meaningless on bad weather days, which would ground warplanes but not hinder the Royal Navy from demolishing the transports and blasting the landing fields.<ref>Mark Simmons, \"The planned 1940 sea invasion of Britain, Operation Sea Lion, remains one of the great 'what-ifs' of modern military history,\" ''Military Heritage'' (2013) 15#1 pp 16-19.</ref>  The German general [[Alfred Jodl]] realized that as long as the British navy was a factor, an invasion would be to send \"my troops into a mincing machine.\"<ref>quoted in Brian James, \"Pie in the Sky?\" ''History Today'' (Sept 2006) 56#9</ref>\n\n====Collaboration====\nWith a wide range of nations collaborating with the Allies, the British needed a way to coordinate the work. The Royal Navy dealt smoothly with the navies-in-exile of Poland, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece using a liaison system between senior naval officers. The system produced the effective integration of Allied navies into Royal Navy commands.<ref>Mark C.

The British fought one of the main squadrons in the [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], Algeria (near Oran), on 3 July 1940. The attack killed 1300 men and sank one or badly damaged three of the four battleships at anchor. The Vichy government was angry indeed but did not retaliate and maintained a state of armed neutrality in the war.<ref>Martin Thomas, \"After Mers-el-Kebir: The armed neutrality of the Vichy French Navy, 1940-43,\" ''English Historical Review'' (1997) 112#447 pp 643-70 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/576348 in JSTOR]</ref>  The British seized warships in British harbors, and they eventually became part of the [[Free French Naval Forces]]. When Germany occupied all of France in November 1942, Vichy France had assembled at Toulon about a third of the warships it had started with, amounting to 200,000 tons. Germany tried to seize them; the French officers then scuttled their own fleet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

It was well behind the British in the latest technology, such as radar, which was essential for night gunnery at long range. The ''Regia Marina'' had six battleships, 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Two aircraft carriers were under construction; they were never launched. The nation was too poor to launch a major shipbuilding campaign, which made the senior commanders cautious for fear of losing assets that could not be replaced.

His actions were largely successful in defeating American, British and Dutch naval forces, although The American fleet held at the battle of Coral Sea, and inflicted a decisive defeat on Yamamoto at Midway.<ref>Hiroyuki Agawa, ''The reluctant admiral: Yamamoto and the Imperial Navy'' (1979) pp 266-302.</ref> [[Guam]] fell in mid-December, and the Philippines were invaded at several points.  Wake Island fell on December 23.  January, 1942 saw the IJN handle invasions of the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Dutch East Indies]], [[New Guinea campaign|Western New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomon Islands]]. IJN built major forward bases at [[Chuuk State|Truk]] and [[Rabaul]].  The Japanese army captured Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. [[Bali]] and [[Timor]] also fell in February. The rapid collapse of Allied resistance had left the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] split in two.  At the [[Battle of the Java Sea]], in late February and early March, the IJN inflicted a resounding defeat on the main ABDA naval force, under the Dutch. The Netherlands East Indies campaign subsequently ended with the surrender of Allied forces on Java.<ref>Paul S.

It was deciseively defeated defending the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]]. The battle consisted of a series of attempts over a seven-hour period by Admiral [[Karel Doorman]]'s Combined Striking Force to attack the Japanese invasion convoy; each was rebuffed by the escort force. Doorman went down with his ships together with 1000 of his crew.

Two more submarines, ''[[NMS Marsuinul|Marsuinul]]'' and ''[[NMS Marsuinul#Sister ship|Rechinul]]'', were launched a short while prior to Romania's entry into the war, but they were commissioned only in May 1943. Also acquired in 1943 were five Italian [[CB-class midget submarine|CB]]-class midget submarines.

Japanese submarines, however, played a minimal role, although they had the best torpedoes of any nation in World War II, and quite good submarines. The difference in results is due to the very different doctrines of the sides, which, on the Japanese side, were based on cultural traditions.\n\n=====Allied doctrine and equipment=====\n{{Main|Allied submarines in the Pacific War}}\nAllied submarines concentrated on destroying Japanese logistics, for which the island nation depended on shipping. Within hours of Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt ordered a new doctrine into effect: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Axis controlled waters, without warning and without help to survivors.  U.S. torpedoes, the standard issue Mark XIV torpedo and its Mark VI exploder were both defective, problems not corrected until September 1943. Worst of all, before the war, an uninformed [[United States Customs|Customs]] officer had seized a copy of the Japanese merchant marine code (called the \"''maru'' code\" in the USN), not knowing U.S. [[communications intelligence]] had broken it;<ref>Ladislas Farago, ''Broken Seal''.</ref> Japan promptly changed it, and it was not recovered until 1943.\n\nThus it was not until 1944 the U.S. Navy learned to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect: effective shipboard radar installed, commanders seen to be lacking in aggression replaced, and faults in torpedoes fixed.\n\n=====Japanese doctrine and equipment=====\n{{Further|Submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy}}\nFor the Imperial Japanese Navy, however, submarines, as part of the Japanese warrior tradition of [[bushido]], preferred to attack warships rather than transports. Faced with a convoy, an Allied submarine would try to sink the merchant vessels, while their Japanese counterparts would give first priority to the escorts. This was important in 1942, before Allied warship production came up to capacity. So, while the U.S. had an unusually long supply line between its west coast and frontline areas that was vulnerable to submarine attack, Japan's submarines were instead used for long range reconnaissance and to supply food for the scores of thousands of soldiers stranded on strongholds which had been cut off, especially [[Chuuk State|Truk]] and [[Rabaul, battle of|Rabaul]].<ref>Mochisura Hasimoto, ''Sunk; The Story of the Japanese Submarine Fleet, 1941-1945'' (1954).</ref>\n\nSupply runs were a lesser drain on Allied resources. The need to supply MacArthur's forces trapped in the Philippines led to diversion of boats to \"guerrilla submarine\" missions. As well, basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while ''en route'' to patrol areas, inhibiting effectiveness, and Nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of enemy bases. A small number of oversized submarines handled much of the resupply, submarines that were less agile than their sisters attacking escorted convoys.\n\nRequirements of the Japanese Army to supply cut-off garrisons by submarine further reduced the effectiveness of Japanese anti-shipping warfare.<ref>Clay Blair, ''Silent Victory: The U. S. Submarine War Against Japan'' (1975).</ref><ref>Theodore Roscoe, ''United States Submarine Operations in World War II'' (1949).</ref> In addition, Japan honored its neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, and ignored U.S. freighters shipping millions of tons of war supplies from San Francisco over northern routes to Vladivostok.<ref>Carl Boyd, \"The Japanese Submarine Force and the Legacy of Strategic and Operational Doctrine Developed Between the World Wars,\" in Larry Addington ed.

Reynolds, ''Command of the Sea: The History and Strategy of Maritime Empires'' (1974) 512.</ref>\n\nA small number of Allied submarines\u2014less than 2 percent of the fleet tonnage\u2014strangled Japan by sinking its merchant fleet, intercepting many troop transports, and cutting off nearly all the oil imports that were essential to warfare. By early 1945 the oil tanks were dry.<ref>Submariners systematically avoided publicity, in order to encourage enemy overconfidence. Japan thought its defensive techniques sank 468 American subs; the true figure was only 42. (Ten others went down in accidents, the Atlantic Ocean, or as the result of friendly fire.) Submarines also rescued hundreds of downed fliers, most famously [[George H. W. Bush]].</ref>\n\n=====Results=====\nThe Japanese commercial fleet was 6.4 million tons in December 1941; during the war 3.9 million tons of new shipping was built. Japanese merchant losses came to 8.9 million tons, leaving 1.5 million tons afloat at the end of the war.<ref>Mark P. Parillo, ''The Japanese Merchant Marine in World War II'' (Naval Institute Press, 1993) p 242.</ref>  Although estimates differ, U.S. submarines alone probably accounted for 56% of the Japanese merchantmen sunk; most of the rest were hit by planes at the end of the war, or were destroyed by mines. U.S. submariners also claimed 28% of Japanese warships destroyed.<ref name=\"UsSubs\">Larry Kimmett and Margaret Regis, [http://www.navpublishing.com/subtour1.htm U.S. Submarines in World War II]</ref> Furthermore, they played important reconnaissance roles, as at the battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, when they gave accurate and timely warning of the approach of the Japanese fleet. Submarines operated from secure bases in Fremantle, Australia; Pearl Harbor; [[Trincomalee]], Ceylon; and later Guam. These had to be protected by surface fleets and aircraft.\n\nJapanese anti-submarine practices were careless and badly managed.<ref>Chihaya Masataka, \"An Intimate Look at the Japanese Navy,\" in Donald M. Goldstein, and Katherine V. Dillon, eds., ''Pearl Harbor Papers'' (1993), p. 323.</ref>  Japanese convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to Allied ones, a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training. The number of U.S. submarines on patrol at any one time increased from 13 in 1942, to 18 in 1943, to 43 in late 1944. Half of their kills came in 1944, when over 200 subs were operating.<ref name=\"UsSubs\"/> By 1945, patrols had decreased because so few targets dared to move on the high seas. In all, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships. Most were small cargo carriers, but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies. Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports. At critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan, and Leyte campaigns, thousands of Japanese troops were killed before they could be landed. Over 200 warships were sunk, ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to eight carriers and one battleship.\n\nUnderwater warfare was especially dangerous for the submarine crews.  The U.S. submarine service included only 1.6% of Navy personnel or 50,000 men. Most were shore based.  Of the 16,000 who went out on patrol, 3,500 (22%) never returned, the highest casualty rate of any American force in World War II.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joel Ira Holwitt|title=\"Execute against Japan\": The U.S. Decision to Conduct Unrestricted Submarine Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrhBItGMEH4C&pg=PA168|year=2009|publisher=Texas A&M UP|page=168}}</ref> The Japanese losses were even worse.\n\n===Atlantic===\n* [[Baltic Sea campaigns (1939\u201345)]]\n* [[Battle of the Atlantic]]\n* [[Commerce raiding]]\n* [[Merchant raiders]]\n* [[Operation Sea Lion]]\n* [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]\n* [[Black Sea Campaigns (1941\u201344)]]\n** [[Romanian Navy during World War II]]\n\n=== Mediterranean ===\n{{main|Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War II)|Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II}}\n\nWhile the Royal Navy spent a great deal of energy dealing with German surface and submarine attacks on its merchant marine, it also launched its own attack on Axis shipping, especially in the Mediterranean.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the '''Peddie Institute''' in honor of philanthropist and politician [[Thomas B. Peddie]], who gave the school $25,000 ($500,000 in 2015 dollars). In 1923 the school was formally renamed The Peddie School, which is as it remained until 2005 when the school was renamed Peddie School and the present logo was created.<ref>[http://www.peddie.org/Page/About-Us/History--Traditions History], The Peddie School. Accessed October 10, 2019.</ref>\n\nPeddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to admit boys only. This was reversed in the early 1970s, and girls were readmitted. Today, the school is coeducational and non-denominational.\n\nIn 1993, former [[Ambassador]] [[Walter Annenberg]] (Class of 1927) gave $100 million to Peddie, the largest donation ever made to a U.S. secondary school at the time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/publisher-gives-365-million-to-4-schools.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Publisher Gives $365 Million To 4 Schools\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 20, 1993.</ref>\n\nWhile previous generous gifts by Annenberg helped the school build a library, dormitories, an athletic center, and a science center, the legendary gift of $100 million was made to see Peddie become accessible to all. This endowment was not earmarked for new buildings, but for financial aid. The endowment has enabled students from all backgrounds to pursue a course of study that would have been unattainable otherwise. In 2018-19, annual tuition for day students is $53,100 and for boarding students is $62,400. Each year, about 40% of Peddie students receive financial aid.<ref>[http://www.peddie.org/podium/default.aspx?t=138760 Admission: Affording Peddie], Peddie School.

Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the '''Peddie Institute''' in honor of philanthropist and politician [[Thomas B. Peddie]], who gave the school $25,000 ($500,000 in 2015 dollars). In 1923 the school was formally renamed The Peddie School, which is as it remained until 2005 when the school was renamed Peddie School and the present logo was created.<ref>[http://www.peddie.org/Page/About-Us/History--Traditions History], The Peddie School. Accessed October 10, 2019.</ref>\n\nPeddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to admit boys only. This was reversed in the early 1970s, and girls were readmitted. Today, the school is coeducational and non-denominational.\n\nIn 1993, former [[Ambassador]] [[Walter Annenberg]] (Class of 1927) gave $100 million to Peddie, the largest donation ever made to a U.S. secondary school at the time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/publisher-gives-365-million-to-4-schools.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Publisher Gives $365 Million To 4 Schools\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 20, 1993.</ref>\n\nWhile previous generous gifts by Annenberg helped the school build a library, dormitories, an athletic center, and a science center, the legendary gift of $100 million was made to see Peddie become accessible to all. This endowment was not earmarked for new buildings, but for financial aid. The endowment has enabled students from all backgrounds to pursue a course of study that would have been unattainable otherwise. In 2018-19, annual tuition for day students is $53,100 and for boarding students is $62,400. Each year, about 40% of Peddie students receive financial aid.<ref>[http://www.peddie.org/podium/default.aspx?t=138760 Admission: Affording Peddie], Peddie School.
