That year, he earned All-Star Game MVP honors and led the Bulls in scoring, assists, and blocks, and was second in the NBA in [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game, averaging 22.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 49.1% from the field and a career-best 32% from the [[three-point field goal|3-point]] line.

The Bulls (with key additions of Toni Kuko\u010d, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley) finished the season with 55 wins, only two fewer than the year before.\n\nHowever, one of the most controversial moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face.

He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000 [[three-point field goal|three-pointers]] in his career.\n\nSeveral NBA players, including [[Jason Kidd]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html|title=Jason Kidd Would Take Scottie Pippen Over LeBron James in His All-Time Starting Five|first=Brian|last=Josephs|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=Jun 15, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Michael Jordan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1849417-michael-jordan-dishes-on-his-starting-5-favorite-shoes-dunks-more|title=Michael Jordan Dishes on His Starting 5, Favorite Shoes, Dunks and More|first=Kenny|last=Dorset|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Nov 13, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and [[Karl Malone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1662152-karl-malone-leaves-mj-off-his-all-time-starting-5-admits-man-crush-on-lebron|title=Karl Malone Leaves MJ Off His All-Time Starting 5, Admits 'Man Crush' on LeBron|first=Zack|last=Buckley|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Jun 4, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> have placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Scottie Pippen and his wife on December 15, 2006.jpg|300x300px|thumbnail|left|Pippen and his wife Larsa attending a [[Chicago Bulls]] game in December 2006]]\nAlthough his given name is spelled ''Scotty'' on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by ''Scottie''.<ref name=smith_07301996/> He stated that people usually shorten the name to ''Scott'' if it ends in ''y''.<ref name=fussman_12162011/>\n\nPippen has been married twice: to Karen McCollum (married 1988; divorced 1990) with whom he has a son, Antron Pippen (born 1987),<ref name=\"SunTimes89\">{{cite news|title=Scottie Pippen|date=May 29, 1989|first=Lacy J.|last=Banks|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=11}}</ref> and to Larsa Younan (married 1997; divorced 2018), with whom he has four children, Scotty Pippen Jr. (born 2000), Preston Pippen (born 2002), Justin Pippen (born 2005), and Sophia Pippen (born 2008).

For his efforts, he earned the first of three straight [[All-NBA First Team]] selections, and he finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting. The Bulls (with key additions of Toni Kuko\u010d, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley) finished the season with 55 wins, only two fewer than the year before.\n\nHowever, one of the most controversial moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then [[Spike Lee]], who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93\u201379.\n\nIn the final Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed a whopping 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87\u201377.<ref name=\"gameseven\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199405220NYK.html|title=Chicago Bulls at New York Knicks Box Score, May 22, 1994|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> The Knicks then proceeded to the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Houston Rockets]], also in seven games.\n\nTrade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season. [[Jerry Krause]], the Bulls' general manager, was reportedly looking to ship Pippen off to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in exchange for all-star forward [[Shawn Kemp]], moving [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] into Pippen's position as starting small forward with Kemp filling in the vacant starting power forward position in place of Horace Grant, a free agent who left the Bulls for the up-and-coming [[Orlando Magic]] during the off-season.  In January, when asked by the late [[Craig Sager]] as to whether he thought that he would be traded, Pippen replied, \"I hope I am\".<ref name=\"bulls_1995\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLFqk2JZEhM|title=Scottie Pippen Hopes to Be Traded to Suns (1995)|work=youtube.com|publisher=NBA TV|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls, late in the {{nbay|1994}} season. The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the {{nbay|1994}} season as they had in the season before. In fact, for the first time in years, they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure). The Bulls were just 34\u201331, prior to Jordan's return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13\u20134 record to close the regular season.

He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time.

It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]''.\n\nThe script was written by [[Charles Lederer]] and Ben Hecht, who is not credited for his contributions. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous, creating several moments in which the characters break the [[fourth wall]]. ''His Girl Friday'' has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks himself was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by ''The Front Page''. He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was #19 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]] and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film is in the [[public domain]] because the copyright was not renewed, though the play it was based on is still under copyright.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Matthew |title=11 Classic Films in the Public Domain |url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/92931/11-classic-films-public-domain |accessdate=4 January 2019 |work=mentalfloss.com |date=6 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:His Girl Friday.webm|thumb|thumbtime=19|left|''His Girl Friday'']]\nWalter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]) is a hard-boiled editor for ''The Morning Post'' who learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard \"Hildy\" Johnson ([[Rosalind Russell]]),{{Efn|According to [[Pauline Kael]], all female reporters in newspaper films were based on [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]].{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=134}}}} is about to marry bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin ([[Ralph Bellamy]]) and settle down to a quiet life as a wife and mother in [[Albany, New York]]. Walter determines to sabotage these plans, enticing the reluctant Hildy to cover one last story, the upcoming execution of Earl Williams ([[John Qualen]]) a shy bookkeeper convicted of murdering an African-American policeman. Walter insists Hildy and her fianc\u00e9 Bruce join him for lunch. At the restaurant, Hildy insists that she and Bruce will be leaving in two hours to take a night train to Albany to be married the following day. Walter attempts to convince Bruce that Hildy is the only one who can write a story to save wrongly convicted Earl Williams. After several attempts through deceit and lies to convince Hildy to stay, Hildy eventually agrees on the condition that Walter buys a $100,000 life insurance policy from Bruce in order to receive the $1,000 commission. In the meantime, Hildy bribes the jail warden to let her interview Earl Williams in jail. Williams explains that he shot the police officer by accident. Hildy uses economic theory to explain the murder of the cop to Williams, insisting that he shot the gun because of [[production for use]].\n\nWalter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, first setting up and accusing Bruce of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy announces her retirement from her profession; however, when Williams escapes from the bumbling [[sheriff]] ([[Gene Lockhart]]) and practically falls into Hildy's lap, the lure of a big [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] proves too much for her. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. At this point, she realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, yet is powerless to bail him out again. Williams comes to the press room holding a gun to Hildy and accidentally shoots a pigeon in fear. Hildy takes the gun from him. Bruce calls, and she tells him to wait because she has Earl Williams in the press room. Williams's friend Mollie comes looking for him, assuring him that she knows he is innocent. When reporters knock at the door, she hides Williams in a roll-top desk. At this time, the building is surrounded by other reporters and cops looking for Williams. Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be ([[Alma Kruger]]) enters berating Hildy for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams's whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window but isn't killed. Annoyed, Walter has his colleague \"Diamond Louie\" ([[Abner Biberman]]) remove Mrs. Baldwin from the room \"temporarily\". Hildy wants to try to get Bruce out of jail, but Walter convinces her that she should focus on her breakthrough story.\n[[File:His Girl Friday 3.jpg|thumb|John Qualen in a scene from the film.]]\nBruce comes into the press room having wired Albany for his bail asking about the whereabouts of his mother, as Hildy is frantically typing out her story. She is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices as Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves to return to Albany on the 9 o'clock train. \"Diamond Louie\" enters the room with torn clothes, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin. Louie reveals that he wasn't sure whether or not she was killed in the accident. The crooked mayor ([[Clarence Kolb]]) and sheriff need the publicity from the execution to keep their jobs in an upcoming election, so when a messenger ([[Billy Gilbert]]) brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, when it will be too late. Walter and Hildy find out in time to save Williams from the gallows and they use the information to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into dropping Walter's arrest for kidnapping Mrs. Baldwin. Hildy receives one last call from Bruce, again in jail because of having counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that Walter was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight. Walter and Hildy send money to bail Bruce out of jail.\n\nAfterward, Walter tells Hildy they're going to remarry, and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in [[Niagara Falls]]. But then Walter learns that there is a newsworthy strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls by train. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change. Walter leads Hildy out of the press room, asking her to carry her own suitcase.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:HisgirlFriday.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]].]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Walter Burns\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Hildy Johnson\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Bruce Baldwin\n* [[Gene Lockhart]] as Sheriff Hartwell\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Murphy\n* [[Ernest Truex]] as Bensinger\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Endicott\n* [[Clarence Kolb]] as the Mayor\n* [[Roscoe Karns]] as McCue\n* [[Frank Jenks]] as Wilson\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Sanders\n* [[Abner Biberman]] as Louie\n* [[Frank Orth]] as Duffy\n* [[John Qualen]] as Earl Williams \n* [[Helen Mack]] as Mollie Malloy\n* [[Alma Kruger]] as Mrs. Baldwin\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Joe Pettibone\n* [[Pat West (actor)|Pat West]] as Warden Cooley\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Dr. Eggelhoffer\n* [[Marion Martin]] as Evangeline (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Howard Hawks head shot.jpg|thumb|left|Director Howard Hawks.]]\nWhile producing ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of ''The Front Page'' to [[Harry Cohn]] of Columbia Pictures. [[Cary Grant]] was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] as the editor.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=278}} Hawks' production that became ''His Girl Friday'' was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of ''The Front Page'', with both the editor and reporter being male.{{Efn|A \"[[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]]\" is an assistant who carries out a variety of chores. The name alludes to \"Friday\", [[Robinson Crusoe]]'s native male [[dogsbody]] in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel. According to Merriam-Webster's, the term was first used in 1940 (the year the film was released).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/girl%20friday|title=Girl Friday|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>}} But during auditions, a woman, Howard Hawks' secretary, read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=308}} Cohn purchased the rights for ''The Front Page'' in January 1939.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}\n\nAlthough Hawks considered the dialogue of ''The Front Page'' to be \"the finest modern dialogue that had been written\", more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=208-209}} Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters' names with two exceptions: Hildy's fianc\u00e9 (now no longer a fianc\u00e9e) was given the name Bruce Baldwin{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}, and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone.{{sfn|Birmingham|1984|p=261}} [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] approved Hawks' idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered [[Gene Fowler]] as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hawks instead recruited [[Charles Lederer]] who had worked on the adaptation for ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' to work on the screenplay.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=96}} Though he was not credited, Hecht did assist Lederer in the adaptation.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=95}} Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory so it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy's intentions of remarriage serving as Walter's motivation to win her back.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=97}}\n\nDuring writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing ''Only Angels Have Wings'', yet stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called [[Morrie Ryskind]] to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, \"the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!\", because films of the time were more censored than [[Pre-code Hollywood]] films and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying \"I do\" in the wedding, they hold in the newsroom with one of the characters stating, \"I think it's gonna turn out all right this time.\" However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and one of his final lines, \"I wonder if Bruce can put us up,\" were better than what he had written originally.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} After reviewing the screenplay, the [[Hays Office]] saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=281-282}}\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|200px|thumb|Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy in a promotional picture for the film.]]\n\n===Casting===\nHawks had difficulty casting ''His Girl Friday''. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted [[Carole Lombard]], whom he had directed in the screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. [[Jean Arthur]] was offered the part, and was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. [[Joan Crawford]] was reportedly also considered.<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Notes Notes TCM]</ref> Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939).{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}} Russell was upset when she discovered from a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article that Cohn was \"stuck\" with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell's first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a \"triple take\". Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}}\n\n===Filming===\nAfter makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on September 27. The film had the working title of ''The Bigger They Are''.<ref name=tcmarticle>{{cite web| last=Miller | first=Frank | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Articles|title= His Girl Friday}}</ref> In her autobiography, ''Life Is A Banquet'', Russell wrote that she thought her role did not have as many good lines as Grant's, so she hired her own writer to \"punch up\" her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing on the set, Russell was able to slip her personal, paid writer's work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning saying, \"What have you got today?\"<ref>New York : Random House, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-394-42134-6}} OCLC 3017310</ref> Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique to ''His Girl Friday''. It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue, none of the actors actually eat during the scene despite the fact that there is food in the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production and it took four days to film instead of the intended two.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} The film was shot with some improvisation of lines and actions, with Hawks giving the actors freedom to experiment, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialog is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur,<ref>Hecht, Ben, & Charles MacArthur, ''The Front Page'', 1928. Samuel French, Inc.</ref> Hawks told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]:\n\n<blockquote>I had noticed that when people talk, they talk ''over'' one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So we wrote the dialogue in a way that made the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they were there for overlapping.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|1997}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday 6.jpg|thumb|left|L. to R. : Cary Grant, Frank Jenks, Roscoe Karns, Gene Lockhart, Pat Flaherty, Porter Hall, Alma Kruger, and Rosalind Russell in one of the final scenes of the film.]]\nTo get the effect he wanted, as [[multi-track sound recording]] was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times.<ref name=tcmarticle /> Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by ''The Front Page''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Filming was difficult for the cinematographers because the improvisation made it difficult to know what the characters were going to do. Rosalind Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}\n\nHawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, a few times breaking the [[fourth wall]] in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera saying, \"Is she going to do that?\". Hawks decided to leave this scene in the picture.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), Hawks added some [[straight man|straight]] supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} [[Arthur Rosson]] worked for three days on [[second unit]] footage at [[Columbia Ranch]]. Filming was completed on November 21, seven days past schedule. Unusually for the time period, the film contains no music besides the music that leads to the final fade out of the film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}}\n\n====Ad-libs by Grant====\nGrant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying \"He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know ... Ralph Bellamy!\" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad-libbed by Grant.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Columbia studio head [[Harry Cohn]] thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other \"inside\" remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name).{{sfn|Fetherling|1977|p=85}} Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts to get out of the rolltop desk he's been hiding in, Grant says, \"Get back in there, you Mock Turtle.\" The line is a \"cleaned-up\" version of a line from the stage version of ''The Front Page'' (\"Get back in there, you God damned turtle!\") and Grant also played \"The Mock Turtle\" in the 1933 film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\n==Release==\nRelease of the film was rushed by Cohn and a sneak preview of the film was held in December, with a press screening on January 3, 1940.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}} ''His Girl Friday'' premiered in [[New York City]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on January 11, 1940, and went into general American release a week later.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Herbert |title='His Girl Friday' Makes Gay Music Hall Comedy |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52684151/?terms=%22%27His+Girl+Friday%27+Makes%22 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |newspaper=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=January 12, 1940 |page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=At the Logan Wednesday |url=https://basic.newspapers.com/image/85484391/?terms=his+girl+friday |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The Logan Daily News |date=January 22, 1940}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nContemporary reviews from critics were very positive.

The world in this film is not determined by gender, but rather by intelligence and capability. At the beginning of the film Hildy says that she wants to be \"treated like a woman\", but her return to her profession reveals her true desire to live a different life.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=105}} In ''His Girl Friday'', even though the characters remarry, Hawks displays an aversion to marriage, home, and family through his approach to the film. Specific, exclusionary camera work and character control of the frame and the dialogue portray a subtle criticism of domesticity. {{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The subject of domesticity is fairly absent throughout the film. Even among the relationships between Grant and Russell and Bellamy and Russell, the relationships are positioned within a larger frame of the male-dominated newsroom.{{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The film, like many comedies, celebrates difficult, tumultuous love rather than secure, suburban love through its preference for movement and argument rather than silent poise.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=126}} Film critic [[Molly Haskell]] wrote that the scene near the end of the film when Hildy sheds tears was not included to expose her femininity, but to express the confusion she felt due to the collision of her professional and feminine natures. The feminine side of Hildy desires to be subservient and sexually relate to men, while the other side of Hildy desires assertion and to forfeit the stereotypical duties of a woman. Her tears represent her emotional helplessness and inability to express anger to a male authority figure.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|pp=133-134}}\n\nA commonality in many Howard Hawks films is the revelation of the amorality of the main character and a failure of that character to change or develop. In ''His Girl Friday'', Walter Burns manipulates, acts selfishly, frames his ex-wife's fianc\u00e9, and orchestrates the kidnapping of an elderly woman. Even at the end of the film, Burns convinces Hildy Johnson to remarry him despite how much she loathes him and his questionable actions. Upon the resumption of their relationship, there is no romance visible between them. They do not kiss, embrace, or even gaze at each other. It is evident that Burns is still the same person he was in their previous relationship as he quickly waves off the plans for the honeymoon that they never had in pursuit of a new story. Additionally, he walks in front of her when exiting the room, forcing her to carry her own suitcase, despite Johnson having already criticized this at the beginning of the film. This hints that the marriage is fated to face the same problems that ended it previously.{{sfn|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}\n\nHawks is known for his use of repeated or intentional gestures in his films. In ''His Girl Friday'', the cigarette in the scene between Hildy and Earl Williams serves several symbolic roles in the film. First, the cigarette establishes a link between the characters when Williams accepts the cigarette even though he does not smoke. However, the fact that he doesn't smoke and they don't share the cigarette shows the difference between and separation of the worlds in which the two characters live.<ref>{{harvnb|Neale|2016|p=110}}; {{harvnb|McElhaney|2006|pp=31\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains two main plots: the romantic and the professional. Walter and Hildy work together to attempt to release wrongly convicted Earl Williams, while the concurrent plot is Walter attempting to win back Hildy. The two plots do not resolve at the same time, but they are interdependent because although Williams is released before Walter and Hildy get back together, he is the reason for their reconciliation.{{sfn|Bordwell|1985|p=158}} The speed of the film results in snappy and overlapping dialogue among interruptions and rapid speech. Gesture, character and camera movement, as well as editing, serve to complement the dialogue in increasing the pace of the film. There is a clear contrast between the fast-talking Hildy and Walter and slow-talking Bruce and Earl which serves to emphasize the gap between the intelligent and the unintelligent in the film. The average word per minute count of the film is 240 while the average American speech is around 140 words per minute. There are nine scenes with at least four words per second and at least two with more than five words per second.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=103}} Hawks attached verbal tags before and after specific script lines so the actors would be able to interrupt and talk over each other without making the necessary dialogue incomprehensible.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=49}}\n\nFilm theorist and historian [[David Bordwell]] explained the ending of ''His Girl Friday'' as a \"closure effect\" rather than a closure. The ending of the film is rather circular and there is no development of characters, specifically Walter Burns, and the film ends similarly to the way in which it starts. Additionally, the film ends with a brief epilogue in which Walter announces their remarriage and reveals their intention to go cover a strike in Albany on the way to their honeymoon. The fates of the main characters and even some of the minor characters such as Earl William are revealed, although there are minor flaws in the resolution. For example, they do not discuss what happened to Molly Malloy after the conflict is resolved. However, the main characters\u2019 endings were wrapped up so well that it overshadows the need for the minor characters' endings to be wrapped up. This creates a \"closure effect\" or an appearance of closure.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordwell|1985|p=159}}; {{harvnb|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''His Girl Friday'' (often along with ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' and ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'') is cited as an archetype of the screwball comedy genre.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=2}} In 1993, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''His Girl Friday'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web| title= U.S. National Film Registry \u2014 Titles| url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html#1993 | work= Clamen's Movie Information Collection| first= Stewart M. |last=Clamen| publisher = [[Carnegie Mellon University]] | accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> The film ranked 19th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]], a 2000 list of the funniest American comedies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf | title= America's Funniest Movies | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> Prior to ''His Girl Friday'' the play ''The Front Page'' had been adapted for the screen once before, in the 1931 film, also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'', produced by [[Howard Hughes]], with [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] in the starring roles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fristoe |first1=Roger |last2=Nixon |first2=Rob |title=The Front Page (1931) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/64127%7C0/The-Front-Page.html |website=Film Article |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> In this first film adaptation of the Broadway play of the same title (written by former Chicago newsmen Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur), Hildy Johnson was male.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on the September 30, 1940 broadcast of [[Lux Radio Theater]] with [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Fred MacMurray]] and [[Jack Carson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KrRQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kiIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5650%2C6978940&q=%22Theater%22 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Spotlighting the Dial \u2013 Dramatic Programs\n|page=2 (Green Sheet) |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=1940-09-30 |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref> It was dramatized again with a half-hour version on [[The Screen Guild Theater]] on March 30, 1941 with Grant and Russell reprising their film roles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PfUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6359%2C2752286 |title=TONIGHT - 7:30 WJAS (advertisement) |page=3 (section 5) |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |date=1941-03-30 |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ScreenGuildTheater/Sgt_41-03-30_ep080_His_Girl_Friday.mp3|title=Screen Guild Theater|date=March 26, 2007|website=Internet Archive}}</ref> \"The Front Page\" was remade in a [[The Front Page (1974 film)|1974 Billy Wilder movie]] starring Walter Matthau as Walter Burns, Jack Lemmon as Hildy Johnson, and Susan Sarandon as his fianc\u00e9e. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |title=Wilder's Uneven Film of 'Front Page' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/19/archives/wilders-uneven-film-of-front-page-the-cast.html |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=December 19, 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Winners and Nominees: The Front Page |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/front-page |website=Golden Globes Awards |publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n''His Girl Friday'' and the original Hecht and MacArthur play were later adapted into another stage play, ''His Girl Friday'', by playwright [[John Guare]].

[[Howard Hawks]] and starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]. It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]''.\n\nThe script was written by [[Charles Lederer]] and Ben Hecht, who is not credited for his contributions. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous, creating several moments in which the characters break the [[fourth wall]]. ''His Girl Friday'' has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks himself was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by ''The Front Page''. He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was #19 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]] and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film is in the [[public domain]] because the copyright was not renewed, though the play it was based on is still under copyright.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Matthew |title=11 Classic Films in the Public Domain |url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/92931/11-classic-films-public-domain |accessdate=4 January 2019 |work=mentalfloss.com |date=6 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:His Girl Friday.webm|thumb|thumbtime=19|left|''His Girl Friday'']]\nWalter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]) is a hard-boiled editor for ''The Morning Post'' who learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard \"Hildy\" Johnson ([[Rosalind Russell]]),{{Efn|According to [[Pauline Kael]], all female reporters in newspaper films were based on [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]].{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=134}}}} is about to marry bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin ([[Ralph Bellamy]]) and settle down to a quiet life as a wife and mother in [[Albany, New York]]. Walter determines to sabotage these plans, enticing the reluctant Hildy to cover one last story, the upcoming execution of Earl Williams ([[John Qualen]]) a shy bookkeeper convicted of murdering an African-American policeman. Walter insists Hildy and her fianc\u00e9 Bruce join him for lunch. At the restaurant, Hildy insists that she and Bruce will be leaving in two hours to take a night train to Albany to be married the following day. Walter attempts to convince Bruce that Hildy is the only one who can write a story to save wrongly convicted Earl Williams. After several attempts through deceit and lies to convince Hildy to stay, Hildy eventually agrees on the condition that Walter buys a $100,000 life insurance policy from Bruce in order to receive the $1,000 commission. In the meantime, Hildy bribes the jail warden to let her interview Earl Williams in jail. Williams explains that he shot the police officer by accident. Hildy uses economic theory to explain the murder of the cop to Williams, insisting that he shot the gun because of [[production for use]].\n\nWalter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, first setting up and accusing Bruce of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy announces her retirement from her profession; however, when Williams escapes from the bumbling [[sheriff]] ([[Gene Lockhart]]) and practically falls into Hildy's lap, the lure of a big [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] proves too much for her. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. At this point, she realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, yet is powerless to bail him out again. Williams comes to the press room holding a gun to Hildy and accidentally shoots a pigeon in fear. Hildy takes the gun from him. Bruce calls, and she tells him to wait because she has Earl Williams in the press room. Williams's friend Mollie comes looking for him, assuring him that she knows he is innocent. When reporters knock at the door, she hides Williams in a roll-top desk. At this time, the building is surrounded by other reporters and cops looking for Williams. Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be ([[Alma Kruger]]) enters berating Hildy for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams's whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window but isn't killed. Annoyed, Walter has his colleague \"Diamond Louie\" ([[Abner Biberman]]) remove Mrs. Baldwin from the room \"temporarily\". Hildy wants to try to get Bruce out of jail, but Walter convinces her that she should focus on her breakthrough story.\n[[File:His Girl Friday 3.jpg|thumb|John Qualen in a scene from the film.]]\nBruce comes into the press room having wired Albany for his bail asking about the whereabouts of his mother, as Hildy is frantically typing out her story. She is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices as Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves to return to Albany on the 9 o'clock train. \"Diamond Louie\" enters the room with torn clothes, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin. Louie reveals that he wasn't sure whether or not she was killed in the accident. The crooked mayor ([[Clarence Kolb]]) and sheriff need the publicity from the execution to keep their jobs in an upcoming election, so when a messenger ([[Billy Gilbert]]) brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, when it will be too late. Walter and Hildy find out in time to save Williams from the gallows and they use the information to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into dropping Walter's arrest for kidnapping Mrs. Baldwin. Hildy receives one last call from Bruce, again in jail because of having counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that Walter was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight. Walter and Hildy send money to bail Bruce out of jail.\n\nAfterward, Walter tells Hildy they're going to remarry, and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in [[Niagara Falls]]. But then Walter learns that there is a newsworthy strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls by train. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change. Walter leads Hildy out of the press room, asking her to carry her own suitcase.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:HisgirlFriday.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]].]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Walter Burns\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Hildy Johnson\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Bruce Baldwin\n* [[Gene Lockhart]] as Sheriff Hartwell\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Murphy\n* [[Ernest Truex]] as Bensinger\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Endicott\n* [[Clarence Kolb]] as the Mayor\n* [[Roscoe Karns]] as McCue\n* [[Frank Jenks]] as Wilson\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Sanders\n* [[Abner Biberman]] as Louie\n* [[Frank Orth]] as Duffy\n* [[John Qualen]] as Earl Williams \n* [[Helen Mack]] as Mollie Malloy\n* [[Alma Kruger]] as Mrs. Baldwin\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Joe Pettibone\n* [[Pat West (actor)|Pat West]] as Warden Cooley\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Dr. Eggelhoffer\n* [[Marion Martin]] as Evangeline (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Howard Hawks head shot.jpg|thumb|left|Director Howard Hawks.]]\nWhile producing ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of ''The Front Page'' to [[Harry Cohn]] of Columbia Pictures. [[Cary Grant]] was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] as the editor.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=278}} Hawks' production that became ''His Girl Friday'' was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of ''The Front Page'', with both the editor and reporter being male.{{Efn|A \"[[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]]\" is an assistant who carries out a variety of chores. The name alludes to \"Friday\", [[Robinson Crusoe]]'s native male [[dogsbody]] in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel. According to Merriam-Webster's, the term was first used in 1940 (the year the film was released).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/girl%20friday|title=Girl Friday|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>}} But during auditions, a woman, Howard Hawks' secretary, read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=308}} Cohn purchased the rights for ''The Front Page'' in January 1939.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}\n\nAlthough Hawks considered the dialogue of ''The Front Page'' to be \"the finest modern dialogue that had been written\", more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=208-209}} Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters' names with two exceptions: Hildy's fianc\u00e9 (now no longer a fianc\u00e9e) was given the name Bruce Baldwin{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}, and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone.{{sfn|Birmingham|1984|p=261}} [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] approved Hawks' idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered [[Gene Fowler]] as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hawks instead recruited [[Charles Lederer]] who had worked on the adaptation for ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' to work on the screenplay.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=96}} Though he was not credited, Hecht did assist Lederer in the adaptation.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=95}} Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory so it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy's intentions of remarriage serving as Walter's motivation to win her back.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=97}}\n\nDuring writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing ''Only Angels Have Wings'', yet stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called [[Morrie Ryskind]] to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, \"the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!\", because films of the time were more censored than [[Pre-code Hollywood]] films and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying \"I do\" in the wedding, they hold in the newsroom with one of the characters stating, \"I think it's gonna turn out all right this time.\" However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and one of his final lines, \"I wonder if Bruce can put us up,\" were better than what he had written originally.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} After reviewing the screenplay, the [[Hays Office]] saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=281-282}}\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|200px|thumb|Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy in a promotional picture for the film.]]\n\n===Casting===\nHawks had difficulty casting ''His Girl Friday''. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted [[Carole Lombard]], whom he had directed in the screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. [[Jean Arthur]] was offered the part, and was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. [[Joan Crawford]] was reportedly also considered.<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Notes Notes TCM]</ref> Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939).{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}} Russell was upset when she discovered from a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article that Cohn was \"stuck\" with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell's first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a \"triple take\". Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}}\n\n===Filming===\nAfter makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on September 27. The film had the working title of ''The Bigger They Are''.<ref name=tcmarticle>{{cite web| last=Miller | first=Frank | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Articles|title= His Girl Friday}}</ref> In her autobiography, ''Life Is A Banquet'', Russell wrote that she thought her role did not have as many good lines as Grant's, so she hired her own writer to \"punch up\" her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing on the set, Russell was able to slip her personal, paid writer's work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning saying, \"What have you got today?\"<ref>New York : Random House, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-394-42134-6}} OCLC 3017310</ref> Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique to ''His Girl Friday''. It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue, none of the actors actually eat during the scene despite the fact that there is food in the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production and it took four days to film instead of the intended two.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} The film was shot with some improvisation of lines and actions, with Hawks giving the actors freedom to experiment, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialog is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur,<ref>Hecht, Ben, & Charles MacArthur, ''The Front Page'', 1928. Samuel French, Inc.</ref> Hawks told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]:\n\n<blockquote>I had noticed that when people talk, they talk ''over'' one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So we wrote the dialogue in a way that made the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they were there for overlapping.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|1997}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday 6.jpg|thumb|left|L. to R. : Cary Grant, Frank Jenks, Roscoe Karns, Gene Lockhart, Pat Flaherty, Porter Hall, Alma Kruger, and Rosalind Russell in one of the final scenes of the film.]]\nTo get the effect he wanted, as [[multi-track sound recording]] was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times.<ref name=tcmarticle /> Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by ''The Front Page''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Filming was difficult for the cinematographers because the improvisation made it difficult to know what the characters were going to do. Rosalind Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}\n\nHawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, a few times breaking the [[fourth wall]] in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera saying, \"Is she going to do that?\". Hawks decided to leave this scene in the picture.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), Hawks added some [[straight man|straight]] supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} [[Arthur Rosson]] worked for three days on [[second unit]] footage at [[Columbia Ranch]]. Filming was completed on November 21, seven days past schedule. Unusually for the time period, the film contains no music besides the music that leads to the final fade out of the film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}}\n\n====Ad-libs by Grant====\nGrant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying \"He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know ... Ralph Bellamy!\" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad-libbed by Grant.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Columbia studio head [[Harry Cohn]] thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other \"inside\" remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name).{{sfn|Fetherling|1977|p=85}} Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts to get out of the rolltop desk he's been hiding in, Grant says, \"Get back in there, you Mock Turtle.\" The line is a \"cleaned-up\" version of a line from the stage version of ''The Front Page'' (\"Get back in there, you God damned turtle!\") and Grant also played \"The Mock Turtle\" in the 1933 film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\n==Release==\nRelease of the film was rushed by Cohn and a sneak preview of the film was held in December, with a press screening on January 3, 1940.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}} ''His Girl Friday'' premiered in [[New York City]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on January 11, 1940, and went into general American release a week later.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Herbert |title='His Girl Friday' Makes Gay Music Hall Comedy |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52684151/?terms=%22%27His+Girl+Friday%27+Makes%22 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |newspaper=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=January 12, 1940 |page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=At the Logan Wednesday |url=https://basic.newspapers.com/image/85484391/?terms=his+girl+friday |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The Logan Daily News |date=January 22, 1940}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nContemporary reviews from critics were very positive.

The world in this film is not determined by gender, but rather by intelligence and capability. At the beginning of the film Hildy says that she wants to be \"treated like a woman\", but her return to her profession reveals her true desire to live a different life.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=105}} In ''His Girl Friday'', even though the characters remarry, Hawks displays an aversion to marriage, home, and family through his approach to the film. Specific, exclusionary camera work and character control of the frame and the dialogue portray a subtle criticism of domesticity. {{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The subject of domesticity is fairly absent throughout the film. Even among the relationships between Grant and Russell and Bellamy and Russell, the relationships are positioned within a larger frame of the male-dominated newsroom.{{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The film, like many comedies, celebrates difficult, tumultuous love rather than secure, suburban love through its preference for movement and argument rather than silent poise.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=126}} Film critic [[Molly Haskell]] wrote that the scene near the end of the film when Hildy sheds tears was not included to expose her femininity, but to express the confusion she felt due to the collision of her professional and feminine natures. The feminine side of Hildy desires to be subservient and sexually relate to men, while the other side of Hildy desires assertion and to forfeit the stereotypical duties of a woman. Her tears represent her emotional helplessness and inability to express anger to a male authority figure.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|pp=133-134}}\n\nA commonality in many Howard Hawks films is the revelation of the amorality of the main character and a failure of that character to change or develop. In ''His Girl Friday'', Walter Burns manipulates, acts selfishly, frames his ex-wife's fianc\u00e9, and orchestrates the kidnapping of an elderly woman. Even at the end of the film, Burns convinces Hildy Johnson to remarry him despite how much she loathes him and his questionable actions. Upon the resumption of their relationship, there is no romance visible between them. They do not kiss, embrace, or even gaze at each other. It is evident that Burns is still the same person he was in their previous relationship as he quickly waves off the plans for the honeymoon that they never had in pursuit of a new story. Additionally, he walks in front of her when exiting the room, forcing her to carry her own suitcase, despite Johnson having already criticized this at the beginning of the film. This hints that the marriage is fated to face the same problems that ended it previously.{{sfn|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}\n\nHawks is known for his use of repeated or intentional gestures in his films. In ''His Girl Friday'', the cigarette in the scene between Hildy and Earl Williams serves several symbolic roles in the film. First, the cigarette establishes a link between the characters when Williams accepts the cigarette even though he does not smoke. However, the fact that he doesn't smoke and they don't share the cigarette shows the difference between and separation of the worlds in which the two characters live.<ref>{{harvnb|Neale|2016|p=110}}; {{harvnb|McElhaney|2006|pp=31\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains two main plots: the romantic and the professional. Walter and Hildy work together to attempt to release wrongly convicted Earl Williams, while the concurrent plot is Walter attempting to win back Hildy. The two plots do not resolve at the same time, but they are interdependent because although Williams is released before Walter and Hildy get back together, he is the reason for their reconciliation.{{sfn|Bordwell|1985|p=158}} The speed of the film results in snappy and overlapping dialogue among interruptions and rapid speech. Gesture, character and camera movement, as well as editing, serve to complement the dialogue in increasing the pace of the film. There is a clear contrast between the fast-talking Hildy and Walter and slow-talking Bruce and Earl which serves to emphasize the gap between the intelligent and the unintelligent in the film. The average word per minute count of the film is 240 while the average American speech is around 140 words per minute. There are nine scenes with at least four words per second and at least two with more than five words per second.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=103}} Hawks attached verbal tags before and after specific script lines so the actors would be able to interrupt and talk over each other without making the necessary dialogue incomprehensible.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=49}}\n\nFilm theorist and historian [[David Bordwell]] explained the ending of ''His Girl Friday'' as a \"closure effect\" rather than a closure. The ending of the film is rather circular and there is no development of characters, specifically Walter Burns, and the film ends similarly to the way in which it starts. Additionally, the film ends with a brief epilogue in which Walter announces their remarriage and reveals their intention to go cover a strike in Albany on the way to their honeymoon. The fates of the main characters and even some of the minor characters such as Earl William are revealed, although there are minor flaws in the resolution. For example, they do not discuss what happened to Molly Malloy after the conflict is resolved. However, the main characters\u2019 endings were wrapped up so well that it overshadows the need for the minor characters' endings to be wrapped up. This creates a \"closure effect\" or an appearance of closure.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordwell|1985|p=159}}; {{harvnb|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''His Girl Friday'' (often along with ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' and ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'') is cited as an archetype of the screwball comedy genre.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=2}} In 1993, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''His Girl Friday'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web| title= U.S. National Film Registry \u2014 Titles| url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html#1993 | work= Clamen's Movie Information Collection| first= Stewart M. |last=Clamen| publisher = [[Carnegie Mellon University]] | accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> The film ranked 19th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]], a 2000 list of the funniest American comedies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf | title= America's Funniest Movies | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> Prior to ''His Girl Friday'' the play ''The Front Page'' had been adapted for the screen once before, in the 1931 film, also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'', produced by [[Howard Hughes]], with [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] in the starring roles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fristoe |first1=Roger |last2=Nixon |first2=Rob |title=The Front Page (1931) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/64127%7C0/The-Front-Page.html |website=Film Article |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> In this first film adaptation of the Broadway play of the same title (written by former Chicago newsmen Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur), Hildy Johnson was male.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on the September 30, 1940 broadcast of [[Lux Radio Theater]] with [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Fred MacMurray]] and [[Jack Carson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KrRQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kiIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5650%2C6978940&q=%22Theater%22 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Spotlighting the Dial \u2013 Dramatic Programs\n|page=2 (Green Sheet) |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=1940-09-30 |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref> It was dramatized again with a half-hour version on [[The Screen Guild Theater]] on March 30, 1941 with Grant and Russell reprising their film roles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PfUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6359%2C2752286 |title=TONIGHT - 7:30 WJAS (advertisement) |page=3 (section 5) |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |date=1941-03-30 |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ScreenGuildTheater/Sgt_41-03-30_ep080_His_Girl_Friday.mp3|title=Screen Guild Theater|date=March 26, 2007|website=Internet Archive}}</ref> \"The Front Page\" was remade in a [[The Front Page (1974 film)|1974 Billy Wilder movie]] starring Walter Matthau as Walter Burns, Jack Lemmon as Hildy Johnson, and Susan Sarandon as his fianc\u00e9e. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |title=Wilder's Uneven Film of 'Front Page' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/19/archives/wilders-uneven-film-of-front-page-the-cast.html |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=December 19, 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Winners and Nominees: The Front Page |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/front-page |website=Golden Globes Awards |publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n''His Girl Friday'' and the original Hecht and MacArthur play were later adapted into another stage play, ''His Girl Friday'', by playwright [[John Guare]].

Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|former Series 4 winner]] and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which features professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

The character originated in a 2009 [[SomethingAwful]] [[Photoshop]] competition, before later being featured as a main antagonist in the ''[[Marble Hornets]]'' [[alternate reality game]]. According to most stories, he targets children. The legend also caused a controversy with the [[Slender Man stabbing]] in 2014.\n\n===Jeff the Killer===\n[[File:Jeff the Killer.jpg|thumb|150px|An image of Jeff the Killer]]\n\"Jeff the Killer\" is a story accompanied by an image of the title character. In the story, a teenager named Jeff is on his way to school with his younger brother when they are attacked by a group of [[Bullying|bullies]]. Jeff defends himself and his brother, and leaves the assailants lying in the street beaten, their hands and arms broken. After his brother claims he injured the bullies and is arrested, Jeff spends several days distraught, before going to a birthday party in the neighbourhood where he is attacked by the bullies again. Although he manages to kill all of the assailants, he is severely burned during the confrontation after being set on fire. During a stay at the hospital, Jeff realizes that he enjoys harming people, and goes insane. The night after he is discharged, he slices his face, leaving [[Glasgow smile|a scar in the shape of a smile]], and cuts off his eyelids, so that he will never sleep. He then murders his parents and brother, whispering \"go to sleep\" while killing his sibling. He becomes a [[serial killer]] who sneaks into houses at night and whispers \"go to sleep\" to his victims before killing them. One of the killings caused a girl to become a restless ghost called Jane the killer hunting Jeff The Killer down to kill him to get revenge for killing her family.Though she does not kill anybody she only desires to kill Jeff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creepypasta.com/jeff-the-killer/|title=Creepypasta \u2013 Jeff the Killer|last=|first=|date=12 August 2012|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2013 article, the original image of Jeff the Killer may be an extensively edited picture of a girl who allegedly committed suicide in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/4chan-x-origins-jeff-the-killer/|title=Jeff the Killer: 4chan Hunts Down the Origins of an Internet Horror Legend|date=2013-08-02|website=The Daily Dot|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> However, this was debunked in 2018 as the original photo was found to predate this event, and the event as a whole was fabricated with an image of a girl taken from a Christian website from 2004.\n\n===Ted the Caver===\n\"Ted the Caver\" began as an [[Angelfire]] website in early 2001 that documented the adventures of a man and his friends as they explored a local cave. The story is in the format of a series of blog posts.  As the explorers move further into the cave, strange hieroglyphs and winds are encountered.

The image shows a large [[German Shepherd]] or [[Husky]] dog that is smiling. The unsettling factors of the image come from its poor image quality, and the dog having human teeth in place of canine teeth. The story goes that if anyone receives the photo (either by email or by regular post), they have to send copies of it to their friends and family members (like a [[Chain Letter]]). If they don't, the photo will slowly change into something horrific and the person will be driven to madness and eventual suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/135749-is-smile-dog-real-heres-the-truth-about-the-classic-creepypasta-its-terrifying-image-file|title=Is \"Smile Dog\" Real?

In the story, a teenage girl named Nina, who is a big fan of Jeff, undergoes the same unfortunate events that Jeff faced. She later burns her own face as a means to impress Jeff, turning her face white. Following her recovery at the hospital, she follows Jeff's path by slicing his face into a Glasgow smile and sewing her eyelids open. Now insane, she then murders her mother and is then imprisoned in an asylum. She eventually escapes and kills her father and brother, whispering \"go to sleep my prince\". Like Jeff, she became a serial killer who sneaks into houses at night and whispers \"go to sleep my prince\" to her victims before killing them while attempting to find Jeff.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Clockwork===\n\"Clockwork\" is a story about a vengeful and cruel serial killer who mutilates her victims at night. A teenage girl named Natalie suffers abuse from her father and brothers. After breaking up with her boyfriend, she eventually snapped and does self-harm by cutting the corners of her mouth and sewing them into a smile. Her mother discovers this and has her sent to a therapist, who begins doing surgery on her to try and help her. Things went horribly wrong when she regained consciousness during the surgery. She then momentarily passes out after coughing blood and after waking up again, the doctor informs her that she was never supposed to wake up and that her appearance had also changed from the botched surgery. Natalie looks into a mirror and quickly notices that her eyes had completely changed to a vibrant green. However, Natalie was surprisingly happy with her \u2018new look\u2019. After she had gone completely insane, she kills the doctor, along with two security guards, and escapes from the hospital. She returns back home through a thunderstorm and kills her family. She walks into the bathroom where she dissembles her father's pocket watch, removes her left eye, and forces the watch's clock face into her eye socket until it 'fits perfectly' and renames herself \u201cClockwork\u201d. Clockwork then burns down her house and walks away. She now carries her insanity with her and saying \"your time is up\" before murdering victims.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Jane the Killer===\n\"Jane the Killer\" is a story the ties in with the story \"Jeff the Killer\". In the story, Jane Arkensaw once had a normal, happy life until Jeff came along, murdered her parents, and set her face on fire. After waking up at a hospital, she removed the bandages on her face and discover that, unlike Jeff, her face is completely brown and ugly and there was no hair on her. She receives a package from Jeff, which contained a black dress, a mask with smiling lips and dark eyes, a wig, a knife, and a bouquet of black roses. That night, she wore the dress, mask, and wig, stole a pair of shoes, and escapes the hospital. After visiting her parent's graves, she now desires to seek revenge on Jeff and changes her name to Jane Everlasting. She is now a serial killer who whispers \"don't go to sleep\" before murdering her victims to ensure that they don't get killed by Jeff while trying to hunt down and kill him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Lost episodes ==\nLost episode creepypastas describe supposed television episodes, typically kids\u2019 shows, that were either never aired or removed from syndication due to their violent and grotesque content.<ref name=Grippo>Grippo, p. 176.</ref> These supposedly lost episodes often focus on suicide or imply the viewer will suffer great harm.<ref name =\"Grippo\"/> Some lost episode creepypastas focus on local public access shows rather than nationally syndicated shows.<ref name =\"Grippo\"/>\n\n===Candle Cove===\n{{main|Candle Cove}}\n\"Candle Cove\" is a story by [[Kris Straub]] written in the format of an online forum thread in which people reminisce about a half-remembered children's television series from the 1970s involving a young girl - the series' protagonist - going on adventures with a cast of pirates, represented through puppetry. The posters share memories of the [[killer toy|creepy puppet]]s from the series, and discuss nightmares that resulted from watching certain episodes (such as those involving a villain called the Skin-Taker, and one that had no dialogue other than screaming). One poster then asks their mother about the series, and is told that the mother just used to tune the television to static, which the child would watch for thirty minutes.\n\n[[Syfy]] announced a television drama based on the story in 2015, adapted by [[Max Landis]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/article/max-landis-adapt-popular-creepypasta-candle-cove-s-221638 | title=Max Landis to adapt popular creepypasta Candle Cove for Syfy | work=The A.V.

Simpson. It features the [[The Simpsons|Simpson family]] going on a plane trip together, but while being his usual, mischievous self, Bart ends up breaking a window on the plane and getting sucked out, falling to his death. After an apparently very realistic view of his corpse, the show's second act features a surreal take on the Simpson family's grief. Act three opens with a title card saying one year has passed. Homer, Marge, and Lisa are skeletally thin, and still sitting at the table. There is no sign of Maggie or the pets. They decide to visit Bart's grave. Springfield is completely deserted, and as they walk to the cemetery the houses become more and more decrepit. Emotionally abandoned, they arrive at Bart\u2019s grave where Bart's body is simply lying in front of his tombstone, appearing similarly to the corpse in act one. The family starts crying again, but eventually they stop and blankly stare at Bart's body. Near the end, the camera starts to zoom into Homer\u2019s face and according to summaries, Homer also tells a joke during this part. The episode ends with a zoom-out of the cemetery, featuring the names of every single Simpsons guest star on the tombstones, with the ones that haven't died yet all having the same death date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/there-really-long-lost-simpsons-episode-where-bart-dies|title=Is there a really a long lost Simpsons episode where Bart dies?|last=Jackson|first=Matthew|date=29 August 2013|work=SYFY WIRE|access-date=2 December 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe story later got a sequel \"A Dead Bart Update\" by the same author, and a spinoff called \"Not Long Enough\", which revolves around a lost episode of [[Futurama]].\n\n=== Squidward's Suicide ===\nThe full story is told from the perspective of a person who interned at Nickelodeon Studios during 2005 as an animation student. The student and some other coworkers received a tape to edit titled \"[[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]]\u2019s Suicide\" for the series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. The staff initially assumed it was just an office prank. In the firsthand account, the video consists of Squidward preparing for a concert. After Squidward finishes playing at the concert, the crowd jeers at Squidward. The next shows Squidward forlornly sitting on a bed, while strange and upsetting noises play and become louder in the background. The scene is spliced with quick flashes of murdered children, each time the noises getting louder when cutting back to Squidward \u2014 now bearing red 'hyper realistic' eyes. Eventually, Squidward shoots himself after a detached, deep voice commands it, and the video ends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/the-scariest-most-believable-stories-on-the-internet-1574772/|title=The 4 scariest, most believable stories on the internet - Geek.com|last=Plafke|first=James|date=31 October 2013|work=Geek.com|access-date=2 December 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe circulated image of red-eyed Squidward associated with this creepypasta was referenced in the series and included in the original airing of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 12)|season 12]] episode \"SpongeBob in RandomLand.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.avclub.com/yep-spongebob-just-directly-referenced-a-classic-creep-1838314120|title=Yep, SpongeBob just directly referenced a classic creepypasta about Squidward killing himself|last=Hughes|first=William|date=21 September 2019|work=The AV Club|access-date=22 September 2019|language=en-US}}</ref> The scene was later replaced with baby Squidward filling his diaper.\n\n===Happy Appy===\n\nThe creepypasta revolves around a lost Nick.

As the blogger progresses into the show, the episodes get more disturbing and morbid with one episode resembling the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks.]] After watching the first ten episodes, the blogger is stalked by a creature named \"Forensik\" as Yakovlev discovers and learns about the dark truth of the show.\n\n==Fanfictions==\nWhile the following stories do not fit the typical definition of creepypastas - often being written from an in-universe perspective, they are sometimes associated with the genre:\n\n===Rainbow Factory===\nCreated by internet user Aurora Dawn, \"Rainbow Factory\" is a fanfiction of [[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]] that tells the story of two [[Pegasus|Pegasai]], Scootaloo, and Orion, two residents of Cloudsdale, who fail a flight test due to trying to help another Pegasus who broke their wing while flying, being transferred to a large factory that is owned by Rainbow Dash. After being locked in a large room with several others, Rainbow Dash reveals how [[Rainbow|rainbows]], and therefore weather is made in Equestria, through the use of mutilated, live Pegasai being put through a machine that converts their corpses into individual colors (known as Strata), which are then mixed together to make rainbows. After attempting to retaliate against Rainbow Dash and the cruelty in the factory, Orion is chained up to the machine and has his limbs dislocated and his ribs shattered, before being tossed in. Scootaloo attempts to escape from a now-maniacal and insane Rainbow Dash, but Scootaloo's attempts to escape are proven fruitless, as she is captured by guards and attached to the machine, where she utters her last words to Rainbow Dash \"You have beautiful eyes\", before it is implied that she is also murdered by the machine. There is a sequel to this centered around a worker at the factory who eventually has had enough and tries to start a rebellion, but is defeated and gets fed to the machine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Video games==\nThese creepypasta focus on video games containing grotesque or violent content; this content may spill over into the real world and cause the player to harm themselves or others.<ref name =\"Grippo\"/> Many video game creepypastas involve malevolent entities such as ghosts or artificial intelligence.<ref name =\"Grippo\"/>\n\n===Ben Drowned===\nCreated by Internet user Alex Hall (a.k.a. \"Jadusable\"), \"Ben Drowned\" tells a story of a college student named Matt who buys a used copy of the video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' from an elderly man at a yard sale.

The game's graphics were very simple, with slow music based on [[Music of the Czech Republic|Czech]] folk songs. The two playable characters were named Porto and Ghast, with Porto being a human miner who could change her size, and Ghast being an invisible demon. As Ghast's invisibility made it impossible for the player to know where their character was, no one was ever able to complete the game as him. Porto's half of the story followed her escape from the mines in which she used to work, and discovering why the employees and machinery were now hostile. The game ends with the screen going white as Porto crawls out of the final tunnel, and the game then deletes itself from the player's computer. Only a limited number of copies were ever released, and Karvina Corporation stated that they never intended to release more of them. The story concludes that in 2005, a man named Yamamoto Ryuichi brought an unplayed copy of ''Killswitch'' for $733,000 and promised to record gameplay of it. Only a 1-minute and 45-second clip was ever found, and the video showed Yamamoto crying in front of the character select screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025215536/http://invisiblegames.net/?p=11|title=Killswitch|last=Valente|first=Catherynne M.|date=25 October 2007|website=Invisible Games|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Lavender Town Syndrome===\n{{main|Lavender Town#Music and the Lavender Town Syndrome}}\nThis legend purports that, shortly after the original Japanese release of the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Green'']] in 1996, there was an increase in the death rate amongst children aged 10\u201315.

As Zach progresses through the game, simple glitches begin to turn into entirely new content and new monsters, and eventually a malevolent, supernatural being by the name of Red reveals himself. As the mystery behind the nature of Red unravels, it is revealed that the demon has closer ties to Zach than he ever could have expected. The story concludes with Zach - having defeated Red during the final battle - selling the game on eBay, unable to bring himself to keep or destroy the mysterious cartridge.\n\nA sequel to the story, dubbed ''Godzilla: Replay'', is being written by the same author as the first, and five chapters have been completed so far.

Everything was mostly the same as in Pokemon Red, but Steven wouldn't go inside the tower at Lavender Town. At the end of Steven's journey, his brother, Mike, challenged him to a Pokemon conflict, and Steven won. The two brothers praised each other for their victory, but after Mike begged Steven to let him have Miki to register her into his Pokedex, the game crashes with a loud \"SNAP!\". Confused, the character loads the game again, but Steven no longer had any of his Pokemon, not even Miki. It is presumed she died in this scene. Over time, the character is forced to watch as Steven lets go of everything he had worked up to, uses a MissingNo. to resurrect his deceased Pokemon at night, and slowly go insane as he turns into a black hairy person with red eyes until the game finally ends.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDespite some minor spelling mistakes, this creepypasta was praised{{By whom|date=April 2020}} for being different to several other creepypastas, and is considered more sad than scary considering the upsetting story of the former Pokemon champion.

The image shows a large [[German Shepherd]] or [[Husky]] dog that is smiling.

The story goes that if anyone receives the photo (either by email or by regular post), they have to send copies of it to their friends and family members (like a [[Chain Letter]]). If they don't, the photo will slowly change into something horrific and the person will be driven to madness and eventual suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/135749-is-smile-dog-real-heres-the-truth-about-the-classic-creepypasta-its-terrifying-image-file|title=Is \"Smile Dog\" Real?

In the story, a teenage girl named Nina, who is a big fan of Jeff, undergoes the same unfortunate events that Jeff faced. She later burns her own face as a means to impress Jeff, turning her face white. Following her recovery at the hospital, she follows Jeff's path by slicing his face into a Glasgow smile and sewing her eyelids open.

She then momentarily passes out after coughing blood and after waking up again, the doctor informs her that she was never supposed to wake up and that her appearance had also changed from the botched surgery. Natalie looks into a mirror and quickly notices that her eyes had completely changed to a vibrant green. However, Natalie was surprisingly happy with her \u2018new look\u2019. After she had gone completely insane, she kills the doctor, along with two security guards, and escapes from the hospital. She returns back home through a thunderstorm and kills her family. She walks into the bathroom where she dissembles her father's pocket watch, removes her left eye, and forces the watch's clock face into her eye socket until it 'fits perfectly' and renames herself \u201cClockwork\u201d.

She receives a package from Jeff, which contained a black dress, a mask with smiling lips and dark eyes, a wig, a knife, and a bouquet of black roses. That night, she wore the dress, mask, and wig, stole a pair of shoes, and escapes the hospital. After visiting her parent's graves, she now desires to seek revenge on Jeff and changes her name to Jane Everlasting. She is now a serial killer who whispers \"don't go to sleep\" before murdering her victims to ensure that they don't get killed by Jeff while trying to hunt down and kill him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Lost episodes ==\nLost episode creepypastas describe supposed television episodes, typically kids\u2019 shows, that were either never aired or removed from syndication due to their violent and grotesque content.<ref name=Grippo>Grippo, p. 176.</ref> These supposedly lost episodes often focus on suicide or imply the viewer will suffer great harm.<ref name =\"Grippo\"/> Some lost episode creepypastas focus on local public access shows rather than nationally syndicated shows.<ref name =\"Grippo\"/>\n\n===Candle Cove===\n{{main|Candle Cove}}\n\"Candle Cove\" is a story by [[Kris Straub]] written in the format of an online forum thread in which people reminisce about a half-remembered children's television series from the 1970s involving a young girl - the series' protagonist - going on adventures with a cast of pirates, represented through puppetry. The posters share memories of the [[killer toy|creepy puppet]]s from the series, and discuss nightmares that resulted from watching certain episodes (such as those involving a villain called the Skin-Taker, and one that had no dialogue other than screaming).

Simpson. It features the [[The Simpsons|Simpson family]] going on a plane trip together, but while being his usual, mischievous self, Bart ends up breaking a window on the plane and getting sucked out, falling to his death. After an apparently very realistic view of his corpse, the show's second act features a surreal take on the Simpson family's grief. Act three opens with a title card saying one year has passed. Homer, Marge, and Lisa are skeletally thin, and still sitting at the table. There is no sign of Maggie or the pets. They decide to visit Bart's grave. Springfield is completely deserted, and as they walk to the cemetery the houses become more and more decrepit. Emotionally abandoned, they arrive at Bart\u2019s grave where Bart's body is simply lying in front of his tombstone, appearing similarly to the corpse in act one. The family starts crying again, but eventually they stop and blankly stare at Bart's body. Near the end, the camera starts to zoom into Homer\u2019s face and according to summaries, Homer also tells a joke during this part. The episode ends with a zoom-out of the cemetery, featuring the names of every single Simpsons guest star on the tombstones, with the ones that haven't died yet all having the same death date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/there-really-long-lost-simpsons-episode-where-bart-dies|title=Is there a really a long lost Simpsons episode where Bart dies?|last=Jackson|first=Matthew|date=29 August 2013|work=SYFY WIRE|access-date=2 December 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe story later got a sequel \"A Dead Bart Update\" by the same author, and a spinoff called \"Not Long Enough\", which revolves around a lost episode of [[Futurama]].\n\n=== Squidward's Suicide ===\nThe full story is told from the perspective of a person who interned at Nickelodeon Studios during 2005 as an animation student. The student and some other coworkers received a tape to edit titled \"[[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]]\u2019s Suicide\" for the series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. The staff initially assumed it was just an office prank. In the firsthand account, the video consists of Squidward preparing for a concert. After Squidward finishes playing at the concert, the crowd jeers at Squidward. The next shows Squidward forlornly sitting on a bed, while strange and upsetting noises play and become louder in the background. The scene is spliced with quick flashes of murdered children, each time the noises getting louder when cutting back to Squidward \u2014 now bearing red 'hyper realistic' eyes. Eventually, Squidward shoots himself after a detached, deep voice commands it, and the video ends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/the-scariest-most-believable-stories-on-the-internet-1574772/|title=The 4 scariest, most believable stories on the internet - Geek.com|last=Plafke|first=James|date=31 October 2013|work=Geek.com|access-date=2 December 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe circulated image of red-eyed Squidward associated with this creepypasta was referenced in the series and included in the original airing of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 12)|season 12]] episode \"SpongeBob in RandomLand.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.avclub.com/yep-spongebob-just-directly-referenced-a-classic-creep-1838314120|title=Yep, SpongeBob just directly referenced a classic creepypasta about Squidward killing himself|last=Hughes|first=William|date=21 September 2019|work=The AV Club|access-date=22 September 2019|language=en-US}}</ref> The scene was later replaced with baby Squidward filling his diaper.\n\n===Happy Appy===\n\nThe creepypasta revolves around a lost Nick.

As the blogger progresses into the show, the episodes get more disturbing and morbid with one episode resembling the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks.]] After watching the first ten episodes, the blogger is stalked by a creature named \"Forensik\" as Yakovlev discovers and learns about the dark truth of the show.\n\n==Fanfictions==\nWhile the following stories do not fit the typical definition of creepypastas - often being written from an in-universe perspective, they are sometimes associated with the genre:\n\n===Rainbow Factory===\nCreated by internet user Aurora Dawn, \"Rainbow Factory\" is a fanfiction of [[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]] that tells the story of two [[Pegasus|Pegasai]], Scootaloo, and Orion, two residents of Cloudsdale, who fail a flight test due to trying to help another Pegasus who broke their wing while flying, being transferred to a large factory that is owned by Rainbow Dash. After being locked in a large room with several others, Rainbow Dash reveals how [[Rainbow|rainbows]], and therefore weather is made in Equestria, through the use of mutilated, live Pegasai being put through a machine that converts their corpses into individual colors (known as Strata), which are then mixed together to make rainbows. After attempting to retaliate against Rainbow Dash and the cruelty in the factory, Orion is chained up to the machine and has his limbs dislocated and his ribs shattered, before being tossed in. Scootaloo attempts to escape from a now-maniacal and insane Rainbow Dash, but Scootaloo's attempts to escape are proven fruitless, as she is captured by guards and attached to the machine, where she utters her last words to Rainbow Dash \"You have beautiful eyes\", before it is implied that she is also murdered by the machine.

The game's graphics were very simple, with slow music based on [[Music of the Czech Republic|Czech]] folk songs. The two playable characters were named Porto and Ghast, with Porto being a human miner who could change her size, and Ghast being an invisible demon. As Ghast's invisibility made it impossible for the player to know where their character was, no one was ever able to complete the game as him. Porto's half of the story followed her escape from the mines in which she used to work, and discovering why the employees and machinery were now hostile. The game ends with the screen going white as Porto crawls out of the final tunnel, and the game then deletes itself from the player's computer. Only a limited number of copies were ever released, and Karvina Corporation stated that they never intended to release more of them. The story concludes that in 2005, a man named Yamamoto Ryuichi brought an unplayed copy of ''Killswitch'' for $733,000 and promised to record gameplay of it. Only a 1-minute and 45-second clip was ever found, and the video showed Yamamoto crying in front of the character select screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025215536/http://invisiblegames.net/?p=11|title=Killswitch|last=Valente|first=Catherynne M.|date=25 October 2007|website=Invisible Games|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Lavender Town Syndrome===\n{{main|Lavender Town#Music and the Lavender Town Syndrome}}\nThis legend purports that, shortly after the original Japanese release of the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Green'']] in 1996, there was an increase in the death rate amongst children aged 10\u201315.

JC-the-Hyena himself eventually remade Sonic.EXE himself into a completely different story to the one originally created.\n\nAs the years have gone on, the original stories have inspired many different Sonic.EXE fangames to be created by several fan creators, some sticking to the original formula while adding the ability to allow the main characters to survive (e.g. Sonic.EXE Nightmare Beginning by JaizKoys and Sonic.EXE The Spirits of Hell by Danuha2526), or creating an entirely different approach altogether.\n\n===''Pokemon Strangled Red''===\n''Pokemon Strangled Red'' is a Pokemon creepypasta made by ShadowMaleRenamon, which attempts to explain about the truth behind the original Pokemon champion of the Kanto Region, whose name was Steven. The character who plays the game takes control of Steven on his journey to become a Pokemon master, only using an overpowered Charizard called Miki. Everything was mostly the same as in Pokemon Red, but Steven wouldn't go inside the tower at Lavender Town. At the end of Steven's journey, his brother, Mike, challenged him to a Pokemon conflict, and Steven won. The two brothers praised each other for their victory, but after Mike begged Steven to let him have Miki to register her into his Pokedex, the game crashes with a loud \"SNAP!\". Confused, the character loads the game again, but Steven no longer had any of his Pokemon, not even Miki. It is presumed she died in this scene. Over time, the character is forced to watch as Steven lets go of everything he had worked up to, uses a MissingNo. to resurrect his deceased Pokemon at night, and slowly go insane as he turns into a black hairy person with red eyes until the game finally ends.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDespite some minor spelling mistakes, this creepypasta was praised{{By whom|date=April 2020}} for being different to several other creepypastas, and is considered more sad than scary considering the upsetting story of the former Pokemon champion.

It was the first of Wilde's stories to be published, appearing in two parts in ''[[The Court and Society Review]]'', 23 February and 2 March 1887.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sherard |first=Robert Harborough |date=1906 |title=The Life of Oscar Wilde |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013572148 |quote=canterville court and society 23 2. |location=New York |publisher=Mitchell Kennerley |page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924013572148/page/n523 454] }}</ref>\n\nThe story is about an American family who move to a castle haunted by the ghost of a dead nobleman, who killed his wife and was starved to death by his wife's brothers. It has been adapted for the stage and screen several times.\n\nGiven a date mentioned in the book (Friday, August 17th) the story might take place during the years 1883 or 1888.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe home of the Canterville Ghost was the ancient Canterville Chase, which has all the accoutrements of a traditional haunted house. Descriptions of the [[wainscoting]], the library panelled in black oak, and the armour in the hallway characterise the setting. Wilde mixes the macabre with comedy, juxtaposing devices from traditional English ghost stories such as creaking floorboards, clanking chains, and ancient prophecies.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins when the American Minister Mr. Otis and his family move into Canterville Chase, despite warnings from Lord Canterville that the house is haunted. Mr. Otis says that he will take the furniture as well as the ghost at valuation. The Otis family includes Mr. and Mrs. Otis, their eldest son Washington, their daughter Virginia, and the Otis twins. At first, none of the Otis family believe in ghosts, but shortly after they move in, none of them can deny the presence of Sir Simon de Canterville. When Mrs. Otis notices a mysterious bloodstain on the floor, she simply replies that \"She does not at all care for bloodstains in the living room\". When Mrs. Umney informs Mrs. Otis that the bloodstain is indeed evidence of the ghost and cannot be removed, Washington Otis, the eldest son, suggests that the stain will be removed with Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent. When the ghost makes his first appearance, Mr. Otis promptly gets out of bed and pragmatically offers the ghost Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator to oil his chains. Angrily the ghost throws the bottle and runs into the corridor. The Otis twins throw pillows on him and the ghost uses the fourth dimension of space to flee. Disappointed with his first attempt to scare the family, he starts wondering what went wrong. He thinks of his previous successful appearances when he was in his prime form.\nThe Otis family witnesses reappearing bloodstains on the floor just by the fireplace, which are removed every time they appear in various colors. But, humorously, none of these scare the Otis family in the least. \nDespite the ghost's efforts to appear in the most gruesome guises, the family refuses to be frightened, and Sir Simon feels increasingly helpless and humiliated. \nWilde describes Mrs. Otis as \"a very handsome middle-aged woman\" who has been \"a celebrated New York belle\". Her expression of modern American culture surfaces when she immediately resorts to giving the ghost \u2019Doctor  Dobell's tincture\u2019, thinking he was screaming due to indigestion at the family's second encounter with the ghost. She expresses an interest in joining the Psychical Society to help her understand the ghost. Mrs. Otis is given Wilde's highest praise when he says: \"Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English...\"\n\nThe most colorful character in the story is undoubtedly the ghost himself, Sir Simon, who goes about his duties with theatrical panache and flair. He assumes a series of dramatic roles in his failed attempts to impress and terrify the Otis family, making it easy to imagine him as a comical character in a stage play. The ghost has the ability to change forms, so he taps into his repertoire of tricks. He takes the role of ghostly apparitions such as a Headless Earl, the Strangled Babe, the Blood-Sucker of Bexley Moor, Suicide's Skeleton, and the Corpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn, all having succeeded in horrifying previous castle residents over the centuries. But none of them works with these Americans. Sir Simon schemes, but even as his costumes become increasingly gruesome, his antics do nothing to scare his house guests, and the Otis beat him every time. He falls victim to tripwires, toy peashooters, butter slides, and falling buckets of water. In a particularly comical scene, he is frightened by the sight of a \"ghost\" rigged up by the mischievous twins.\n\nDuring the course of the story, as narrated from Sir Simon's viewpoint, he tells us the complexity of the ghost's emotions: he sees himself brave, frightening, distressed, scared, and finally, depressed and weak. He exposes his vulnerability during an encounter with Virginia, the Otis's fifteen-year-old daughter. Virginia is different from everyone else in the family, and Sir Simon recognizes this. He tells her that he has not slept in three hundred years and wants desperately to do so. The ghost reveals to Virginia the tragic tale of his wife, Lady Eleanor de Canterville.\n\nUnlike the rest of her family, Virginia does not dismiss the ghost. She takes him seriously, she listens to him and learns an important lesson, as well as the true meaning behind a riddle. Sir Simon de Canterville says that she must weep for him, for he has no tears; she must pray for him, for he has no faith; and then she must accompany him to the angel of death and beg for death upon Sir Simon. She does weep for him and pray for him, and she disappears with Sir Simon through the wainscoting and goes with him to the Garden of Death and bids the ghost farewell. Then she reappears at midnight, through a panel in the wall, carrying jewels and news that Sir Simon has passed on to the next world and no longer resides in the house.\n\nVirginia's ability to accept Sir Simon leads to her enlightenment. The story ends with Virginia marrying the Duke of Cheshire after they both come of age. Sir Simon, she tells her husband several years later, helped her understand what Life is, what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than both.\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{in popular culture|date=March 2017}}{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}\n\n'''Theatrical Films'''\n\n* ''[[The Canterville Ghost (1944 film)|The Canterville Ghost]]'', a 1944 Hollywood movie with [[Charles Laughton]] in the title role\n* ''\u041a\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435'', a 1970 Soviet animated film.\n* ''[[Bhoothnath]]'', a 2008 [[Bollywood]] movie adaptation<ref name=\"Chopra\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/bhoothnath-review-bollywood-14670297.html|title=Bhoothnath|author1=Sonia Chopra|work=Sify}}</ref>\n*''[[The Canterville Ghost (2016 film)|The Canterville Ghost]]'', (''Le Fant\u00f4me de Canterville'') a 2016 French-Belgian film.\n*''The Canterville Ghost'', a British animated feature film with the voices of [[Stephen Fry]], [[Hugh Laurie]], and [[Miranda Hart]], originally intended for release in 2016<ref name=\"Radio Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-25/fry-and-laurie-to-reunite-for-the-canterville-ghost|title=Fry and Laurie to reunite for The Canterville Ghost|last=Bettridge|first=Daniel|date=25 October 2012|work=Radio Times|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> and unreleased as of December 2019.\n\n'''On Television'''\n\nAccording to The [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films|American Film Institute Catalog]], \u201cAmong the many other adaptations of Oscar Wilde's story are the following television versions, all titled ''The Canterville Ghost'' :\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/2470-THE-CANTERVILLEGHOST?sid=27f87a2d-4720-4c0f-8a05-2fa4212f255f&sr=11.7472515&cp=1&pos=0|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nSept.28, 1949 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]], directed by Fred Carr and starring [[Wendy Barrie]] and [[Edward Ashley-Cooper|Edward Ashley]]\n\nNovember 20, 1950 on [[NBC|NBC network]]\u2019s ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents|Robert Montgomery Presents Your Lucky Strike Theatre]],'' starring [[Cecil Parker]] and [[Margaret O'Brien]]\n\nApril 12, 1951, on the [[DuMont Television Network|Du Mont network]],  directed by [[Frank Wisbar]], starring [[Lois Hall]], [[Reginald Sheffield]] and [[Bruce Lester]]\n\nMay 1953, [[Ziv Television Programs|Ziv TV]]\u2019s syndicated version, directed by [[Sobey Martin]],  starring [[John Qualen]] and Connie Marshall\n\nNovember 9, 1966, ''The Canterville Ghost'', a 1966 [[American Broadcasting Company (ABC)|ABC]] television musical that aired 2 November and featured [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and [[Michael Redgrave]].

When Mrs. Umney informs Mrs. Otis that the bloodstain is indeed evidence of the ghost and cannot be removed, Washington Otis, the eldest son, suggests that the stain will be removed with Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent. When the ghost makes his first appearance, Mr. Otis promptly gets out of bed and pragmatically offers the ghost Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator to oil his chains. Angrily the ghost throws the bottle and runs into the corridor. The Otis twins throw pillows on him and the ghost uses the fourth dimension of space to flee. Disappointed with his first attempt to scare the family, he starts wondering what went wrong. He thinks of his previous successful appearances when he was in his prime form.\nThe Otis family witnesses reappearing bloodstains on the floor just by the fireplace, which are removed every time they appear in various colors. But, humorously, none of these scare the Otis family in the least. \nDespite the ghost's efforts to appear in the most gruesome guises, the family refuses to be frightened, and Sir Simon feels increasingly helpless and humiliated. \nWilde describes Mrs. Otis as \"a very handsome middle-aged woman\" who has been \"a celebrated New York belle\". Her expression of modern American culture surfaces when she immediately resorts to giving the ghost \u2019Doctor  Dobell's tincture\u2019, thinking he was screaming due to indigestion at the family's second encounter with the ghost. She expresses an interest in joining the Psychical Society to help her understand the ghost. Mrs. Otis is given Wilde's highest praise when he says: \"Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English...\"\n\nThe most colorful character in the story is undoubtedly the ghost himself, Sir Simon, who goes about his duties with theatrical panache and flair. He assumes a series of dramatic roles in his failed attempts to impress and terrify the Otis family, making it easy to imagine him as a comical character in a stage play. The ghost has the ability to change forms, so he taps into his repertoire of tricks. He takes the role of ghostly apparitions such as a Headless Earl, the Strangled Babe, the Blood-Sucker of Bexley Moor, Suicide's Skeleton, and the Corpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn, all having succeeded in horrifying previous castle residents over the centuries. But none of them works with these Americans. Sir Simon schemes, but even as his costumes become increasingly gruesome, his antics do nothing to scare his house guests, and the Otis beat him every time. He falls victim to tripwires, toy peashooters, butter slides, and falling buckets of water. In a particularly comical scene, he is frightened by the sight of a \"ghost\" rigged up by the mischievous twins.\n\nDuring the course of the story, as narrated from Sir Simon's viewpoint, he tells us the complexity of the ghost's emotions: he sees himself brave, frightening, distressed, scared, and finally, depressed and weak. He exposes his vulnerability during an encounter with Virginia, the Otis's fifteen-year-old daughter. Virginia is different from everyone else in the family, and Sir Simon recognizes this. He tells her that he has not slept in three hundred years and wants desperately to do so. The ghost reveals to Virginia the tragic tale of his wife, Lady Eleanor de Canterville.\n\nUnlike the rest of her family, Virginia does not dismiss the ghost. She takes him seriously, she listens to him and learns an important lesson, as well as the true meaning behind a riddle. Sir Simon de Canterville says that she must weep for him, for he has no tears; she must pray for him, for he has no faith; and then she must accompany him to the angel of death and beg for death upon Sir Simon. She does weep for him and pray for him, and she disappears with Sir Simon through the wainscoting and goes with him to the Garden of Death and bids the ghost farewell. Then she reappears at midnight, through a panel in the wall, carrying jewels and news that Sir Simon has passed on to the next world and no longer resides in the house.\n\nVirginia's ability to accept Sir Simon leads to her enlightenment. The story ends with Virginia marrying the Duke of Cheshire after they both come of age. Sir Simon, she tells her husband several years later, helped her understand what Life is, what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than both.\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{in popular culture|date=March 2017}}{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}\n\n'''Theatrical Films'''\n\n* ''[[The Canterville Ghost (1944 film)|The Canterville Ghost]]'', a 1944 Hollywood movie with [[Charles Laughton]] in the title role\n* ''\u041a\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435'', a 1970 Soviet animated film.\n* ''[[Bhoothnath]]'', a 2008 [[Bollywood]] movie adaptation<ref name=\"Chopra\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/bhoothnath-review-bollywood-14670297.html|title=Bhoothnath|author1=Sonia Chopra|work=Sify}}</ref>\n*''[[The Canterville Ghost (2016 film)|The Canterville Ghost]]'', (''Le Fant\u00f4me de Canterville'') a 2016 French-Belgian film.\n*''The Canterville Ghost'', a British animated feature film with the voices of [[Stephen Fry]], [[Hugh Laurie]], and [[Miranda Hart]], originally intended for release in 2016<ref name=\"Radio Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-25/fry-and-laurie-to-reunite-for-the-canterville-ghost|title=Fry and Laurie to reunite for The Canterville Ghost|last=Bettridge|first=Daniel|date=25 October 2012|work=Radio Times|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> and unreleased as of December 2019.\n\n'''On Television'''\n\nAccording to The [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films|American Film Institute Catalog]], \u201cAmong the many other adaptations of Oscar Wilde's story are the following television versions, all titled ''The Canterville Ghost'' :\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/2470-THE-CANTERVILLEGHOST?sid=27f87a2d-4720-4c0f-8a05-2fa4212f255f&sr=11.7472515&cp=1&pos=0|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nSept.28, 1949 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]], directed by Fred Carr and starring [[Wendy Barrie]] and [[Edward Ashley-Cooper|Edward Ashley]]\n\nNovember 20, 1950 on [[NBC|NBC network]]\u2019s ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents|Robert Montgomery Presents Your Lucky Strike Theatre]],'' starring [[Cecil Parker]] and [[Margaret O'Brien]]\n\nApril 12, 1951, on the [[DuMont Television Network|Du Mont network]],  directed by [[Frank Wisbar]], starring [[Lois Hall]], [[Reginald Sheffield]] and [[Bruce Lester]]\n\nMay 1953, [[Ziv Television Programs|Ziv TV]]\u2019s syndicated version, directed by [[Sobey Martin]],  starring [[John Qualen]] and Connie Marshall\n\nNovember 9, 1966, ''The Canterville Ghost'', a 1966 [[American Broadcasting Company (ABC)|ABC]] television musical that aired 2 November and featured [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and [[Michael Redgrave]].

Both companies had been formed from smaller privately owned corporations that had been nationalized into six regional design and manufacturing pools just prior to the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\nThe company became a major manufactuter of helicopters, designing and producing several types which went on to be built in large numbers, including the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] (the first production helicopter powered by a [[gas turbine]] engine; first flight in 1955), the [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma]] (1965) and [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] (1967).

A\u00e9rospatiale formed several large-scale international consortia, for example with [[British Aerospace]] and [[Messerschmitt|Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] to form [[Airbus]]; the company ultimately merged into the European aerospace conglomerate [[EADS]] in 2000. During January 2014, EADS was reorganised as the Airbus Group.\n\n==History==\nSud Aviation became an early innovator in the field of commercial jetliners. Almost two years prior to its formation, on 27 May 1955, the first prototype of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] had conducted its [[maiden flight]].<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> The company chose to continued the Caravelle's flight test programme, receiving its [[Airworthiness certificate|certificate of airworthiness]] in May 1959 and commencing operations with French [[flag carrier]] [[Air France]] shortly thereafter. Further orders for the type would be received from a variety of different airlines.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> Within four years of entering airliner service, a total of 172 Caravelles had been sold to a range of operators.<ref name = \"doug 456\">Dougal 1963, p. 456.</ref> The Carvelle's favourable early sales record was attributed by aviation author M.G. Douglas to Sud Aviation's effective marketing campaign of performing demonstrations to prospective customers using the two prototypes, as well to the Caravelle having effectively no jet-powered rivals, being the only short-haul jetliner for several years following its introduction.<ref name = \"doug 456\"/>\n\nSeveral models of the Caravelle were developed and produced over the lifetime of the production run, often in response to the increasing power of the available engines, which allowed higher takeoff weights to be adopted.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> By 1963, there were a total of six different versions of the Caravelle in production, designated ''III'', ''VI-N'', ''VI-R'', ''10A'', ''10B'', and ''X-BIR''.<ref name = \"doug 457\">Dougal 1963, p. 457.</ref> The final assembly line for the Caravelle was at Sud Aviation's factory at [[Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport|Blagnac Airport]] near [[Toulouse]]. Much of the aircraft was manufactured at other sites across France and in other countries, however.<ref name = \"doug 456 467\">Dougal 1963, pp. 456\u2013457.</ref> By the end of the type's production, a total of 282 Caravelles of all types had been manufactured (2 prototypes or pre-production aircraft and 280 production aircraft); reportedly, Sud Aviation's projected [[break-even point]] for the airliner had been forecast to be around the 200-unit mark.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\">{{cite book |last1=L\u00f3pez Ortega |first1=Antonio |title=Reactores comerciales: Dibujos del autor |year=1999 |publisher=Agualarga |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |isbn=978-84-95088-87-1 |oclc=47809267}}</ref>\n\nDespite its commercial success, however, the Caravelle was displaced from being the focus of Sud Aviation's development efforts during the early 1960s. This was due to the majority of the company's design engineers were progressively reallocated onto an entirely new project that was intended to produce a successor to the Caravelle.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> The project was relatively ambitious, having the aim of producing a viable [[supersonic transport]] that possessed the same general size and range as the Caravelle. It was decided that the envisioned supersonic airliner should be naturally named after the firm's recent success, thus the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle|Super-Caravelle]] name was applied to the design.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> The French Government had requested supersonic transport designs from Sud Aviation, as well as French rival firms [[Nord Aviation]] and [[Dassault]] during the late 1950s; of the three submissions made, the Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design, which was deliberately sized to avoid competition with [[transatlantic]] designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nHowever, in part due to the very high projected cost of the project, it was decided, at the direction of both the French and British governments, to form a consortium with the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) during November 1962, merging their design and production efforts to develop a supersonic transport. Out of these combined efforts, [[Concorde]] would emerge.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> At first, the new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version.

During the type's development, Sud Aviation had risen to prominence as a major helicopter manufacturer, having exported more rotorcraft than any other European rival.<ref name=\"Stevens 55\"/> Having already developed the popular Alouette II and Alouette III series, the firm was keen to establish a range of helicopters fulfilling various roles, functions, and size requirements; two of the larger models in development by the early 1960s were the Super Frelon and what would become the [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma]]. The Super Frelon was the largest helicopter in development by the firm, being substantially increased over the earlier Frelon, and was considered to be an ambitious design at the time.<ref name=\"Stevens 55\"/> The earlier Frelon had been developed to meet the requirements of both the [[French Navy]] and the [[German Navy]], which both had released details on its anticipated demands for a heavy helicopter; however, these requirements were revised upwards by the customer, leading to the redesign and emergence of the Super Frelon.<ref name=\"Stevens 55\">Stevens 1964, p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 1963, a modified prototype Super Frelon helicopter was used to break the FAI absolute helicopter world speed record, having attained a maximum speed of {{convert|217.7|mph|abbr=on}} during the flight.<ref name=\"JAWA66 p63\">Taylor 1966, p. 63.</ref> Flown by Jean Boulet and Roland Coffignot, a total of three international records were broken, these being: speed over 3&nbsp;km at low altitude,\n212.03&nbsp;mph; speed at any altitude over 15 and 25&nbsp;km, 217.77&nbsp;mph; and 100km closed circuit 207.71&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Stevens 56\">Stevens 1964, p. 56.</ref> By July 1964, the French Government had placed an initial order for the Super Frelon, intended to perform logistic support duties at the Centre Experimental du Pacifique; negotiations for a further order was already being negotiated for the naval version, which were to be equipped for anti-submarine duties. However, [[West Germany|West German]] support for the Super Frelon programme had already declined by this point, partially due to interest in the rival [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]], which was evaluated against the type.<ref name=\"Stevens 56\"/> Both civilian and military versions of the Super Frelon were built, with the military variants being the most numerous by far, entering service with the French military as well as being exported to [[Israel]], [[South Africa]], [[Libya]], [[China]] and [[Iraq]].

A\u00e9rospatiale formed several large-scale international consortia, for example with [[British Aerospace]] and [[Messerschmitt|Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] to form [[Airbus]]; the company ultimately merged into the European aerospace conglomerate [[EADS]] in 2000. During January 2014, EADS was reorganised as the Airbus Group.\n\n==History==\nSud Aviation became an early innovator in the field of commercial jetliners. Almost two years prior to its formation, on 27 May 1955, the first prototype of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] had conducted its [[maiden flight]].<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> The company chose to continued the Caravelle's flight test programme, receiving its [[Airworthiness certificate|certificate of airworthiness]] in May 1959 and commencing operations with French [[flag carrier]] [[Air France]] shortly thereafter. Further orders for the type would be received from a variety of different airlines.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> Within four years of entering airliner service, a total of 172 Caravelles had been sold to a range of operators.<ref name = \"doug 456\">Dougal 1963, p. 456.</ref> The Carvelle's favourable early sales record was attributed by aviation author M.G. Douglas to Sud Aviation's effective marketing campaign of performing demonstrations to prospective customers using the two prototypes, as well to the Caravelle having effectively no jet-powered rivals, being the only short-haul jetliner for several years following its introduction.<ref name = \"doug 456\"/>\n\nSeveral models of the Caravelle were developed and produced over the lifetime of the production run, often in response to the increasing power of the available engines, which allowed higher takeoff weights to be adopted.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> By 1963, there were a total of six different versions of the Caravelle in production, designated ''III'', ''VI-N'', ''VI-R'', ''10A'', ''10B'', and ''X-BIR''.<ref name = \"doug 457\">Dougal 1963, p. 457.</ref> The final assembly line for the Caravelle was at Sud Aviation's factory at [[Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport|Blagnac Airport]] near [[Toulouse]]. Much of the aircraft was manufactured at other sites across France and in other countries, however.<ref name = \"doug 456 467\">Dougal 1963, pp. 456\u2013457.</ref> By the end of the type's production, a total of 282 Caravelles of all types had been manufactured (2 prototypes or pre-production aircraft and 280 production aircraft); reportedly, Sud Aviation's projected [[break-even point]] for the airliner had been forecast to be around the 200-unit mark.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\">{{cite book |last1=L\u00f3pez Ortega |first1=Antonio |title=Reactores comerciales: Dibujos del autor |year=1999 |publisher=Agualarga |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |isbn=978-84-95088-87-1 |oclc=47809267}}</ref>\n\nDespite its commercial success, however, the Caravelle was displaced from being the focus of Sud Aviation's development efforts during the early 1960s. This was due to the majority of the company's design engineers were progressively reallocated onto an entirely new project that was intended to produce a successor to the Caravelle.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> The project was relatively ambitious, having the aim of producing a viable [[supersonic transport]] that possessed the same general size and range as the Caravelle. It was decided that the envisioned supersonic airliner should be naturally named after the firm's recent success, thus the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle|Super-Caravelle]] name was applied to the design.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> The French Government had requested supersonic transport designs from Sud Aviation, as well as French rival firms [[Nord Aviation]] and [[Dassault]] during the late 1950s; of the three submissions made, the Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design, which was deliberately sized to avoid competition with [[transatlantic]] designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nHowever, in part due to the very high projected cost of the project, it was decided, at the direction of both the French and British governments, to form a consortium with the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) during November 1962, merging their design and production efforts to develop a supersonic transport. Out of these combined efforts, [[Concorde]] would emerge.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez1\"/> At first, the new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version. However, prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version, thus it was dropped to focus on the long-range airliner.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a \"Early History.\"] concordesst.com.

During the type's development, Sud Aviation had risen to prominence as a major helicopter manufacturer, having exported more rotorcraft than any other European rival.<ref name=\"Stevens 55\"/> Having already developed the popular Alouette II and Alouette III series, the firm was keen to establish a range of helicopters fulfilling various roles, functions, and size requirements; two of the larger models in development by the early 1960s were the Super Frelon and what would become the [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma]]. The Super Frelon was the largest helicopter in development by the firm, being substantially increased over the earlier Frelon, and was considered to be an ambitious design at the time.<ref name=\"Stevens 55\"/> The earlier Frelon had been developed to meet the requirements of both the [[French Navy]] and the [[German Navy]], which both had released details on its anticipated demands for a heavy helicopter; however, these requirements were revised upwards by the customer, leading to the redesign and emergence of the Super Frelon.<ref name=\"Stevens 55\">Stevens 1964, p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 1963, a modified prototype Super Frelon helicopter was used to break the FAI absolute helicopter world speed record, having attained a maximum speed of {{convert|217.7|mph|abbr=on}} during the flight.<ref name=\"JAWA66 p63\">Taylor 1966, p. 63.</ref> Flown by Jean Boulet and Roland Coffignot, a total of three international records were broken, these being: speed over 3&nbsp;km at low altitude,\n212.03&nbsp;mph; speed at any altitude over 15 and 25&nbsp;km, 217.77&nbsp;mph; and 100km closed circuit 207.71&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Stevens 56\">Stevens 1964, p. 56.</ref> By July 1964, the French Government had placed an initial order for the Super Frelon, intended to perform logistic support duties at the Centre Experimental du Pacifique; negotiations for a further order was already being negotiated for the naval version, which were to be equipped for anti-submarine duties. However, [[West Germany|West German]] support for the Super Frelon programme had already declined by this point, partially due to interest in the rival [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]], which was evaluated against the type.<ref name=\"Stevens 56\"/> Both civilian and military versions of the Super Frelon were built, with the military variants being the most numerous by far, entering service with the French military as well as being exported to [[Israel]], [[South Africa]], [[Libya]], [[China]] and [[Iraq]]. Three military variants were produced: military transport, anti-submarine and anti-ship. The transport version is able to carry 38 equipped troops, or alternatively 15 stretchers for casualty evacuation tasks.\n\nDuring 1963, Sud Aviation began work on what would become the [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma]], a mid-sized helicopter, to meet a requirement of the [[French Army]] for a medium-sized all-weather helicopter capable of carrying up to 20 soldiers as well as various cargo-carrying duties.
