The specimen \"''V. amnhophilis\"'' is known from several bone fragments, including the right side of the braincase, a right [[quadrate bone]], part of the palate and [[skull roof]], the right [[Coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]] and glenoid region of the lower jaw, a piece of the [[clavicle]], and five vertebrae.

The specimen was not identified as a reptile until 2009. It was then that mammal paleontologist Nikos Solounias, who has worked extensively on Samos Island fossils, brought the fossil to the attention of Carl Mehling. Mehling removed the specimen from the fossil mammal collection and cataloged it as AMNH FR (fossil reptile) 30630.

He began his service as a soldier in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], briefly spending time as a [[prisoner of war]] of the British during the [[Seven Years' War]].  Naval exploits during the latter war prompted him to change branches of service, and he transferred to the [[French Navy]].\n\nFollowing France's entry into the [[American War of Independence]] in 1778, d'Estaing led a fleet to aid the American rebels. He participated in a failed Franco-American [[Battle of Rhode Island|siege of Newport, Rhode Island]] in 1778 and the equally unsuccessful 1779 [[Siege of Savannah]]. He did have success in the Caribbean before returning to France in 1780.  His difficulties working with American counterparts are cited among the reasons these operations in North America failed.\n\nAlthough d'Estaing sympathized with revolutionaries during the [[French Revolution]], he held a personal loyalty to the French royal family.  Because of this he came under suspicion, and was executed by [[guillotine]] in the [[Reign of Terror]].\n\n== Early years ==\nHe was born on 24 November 1729 at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ravel]] in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] to Charles-Fran\u00e7ois, the Marquis de Saillant and Marie-Henriette Colbert de Maulevrier, a descendant of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]].<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 2-3</ref>  His father was a lieutenant general in the [[French Army]] from [[D'Estaing family|a family]] with a long history of service to the French crown.<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 2</ref>  The young d'Estaing was educated alongside [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729\u20131765)|Louis]], the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (father of the future [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]), who was born at about the same time.<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 3</ref>  D'Estaing thus became close friends with the Dauphin and served in his retinue.<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 4</ref>\n\nIn May 1738 at the age of 9 he was nominally enrolled in the [[musketeer]]s, as his aristocratic family chose military service over civil for him. He rose through the ranks, eventually joining the [[:fr:R\u00e9giment de Rouergue|Regiment de Rouergue]] (fr.) as a lieutenant in 1746. That same year he married Marie-Sophie, granddaughter of the celebrated [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis de Rousselet, Marquis de Ch\u00e2teaurenault|Marshal Ch\u00e2teau-Renault]]. His regiment was  called to serve in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].  D'Estaing served as aide-de-camp to [[Maurice de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] throughout the [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] campaigns of 1746\u201348. During these years he was promoted to colonel in command of Regiment de Rouergue, and was wounded at the 1748 [[Siege of Maastricht (1748)|Siege of Maastricht]].<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 5</ref>\n\nFollowing the war [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] embarked on a program to modernize his army on the successful model of [[Frederick the Great]]'s [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army.  D'Estaing became one of the leading reformers. After a few years, the Regiment de Rouergue was viewed \"as a model of the infantry\".<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 6</ref>  Seeking to gain experience in diplomacy, d'Estaing accompanied the French ambassador to England for a time.<ref name=CM7>Colman-Maison, p. 7</ref>\n\n== Seven Years' War in India ==\n{{Main|Seven Years' War|Third Carnatic War}}\nWhen [[French and Indian War|hostilities broke out]] between the British and French colonies in [[North America]], d'Estaing considered joining the forces of [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] that sailed in 1755, but his family dissuaded him from doing so.<ref name=CM7 />  When an expedition to the [[East Indies]] was organized, he applied to participate without consulting his family.

On 4 May French forces occupied the town and partially blockaded Fort St. David.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 22-23</ref>  The siege equipment was delayed in its arrival, but the garrison was eventually compelled to surrender after 17 days of siege operations.  D'Estaing commanded Lally's left, overseeing the approaches and placing of batteries.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 26-28</ref>  He continued to serve under Lally in his campaigns against the British in southern India.  He opposed Lally's decision to lift the siege of [[Tanjore]] (the only one in Lally's war council to do so) following the British seizure of Karikal.  When Lally began to [[Siege of Madras|besiege Madras]] in December 1758, d'Estaing's division was positioned in the center of the French line.  When the British made a sortie against that sector, d'Estaing advanced alone to reconnoiter their movements.  He was surrounded by British troops, unhorsed, and twice wounded by [[bayonet]] before surrendering.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 30-44</ref>\n\nD'Estaing was taken into Madras, where he was confined by the order of Governor [[George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot|George Pigot]].  Pigot offered to release him on [[parole]], but d'Estaing refused, preferring instead to be exchanged so that he could resume fighting.<ref>Colman-Maison,  p. 44</ref>  The arrival of a British fleet off Madras in February 1759 convinced d'Estaing to accept the offer of parole, which was conditioned on his not fighting against the British in the East Indies.<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 45</ref>  In May 1759 he sailed for \u00cele-de-France (present-day [[Mauritius]]).<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 46</ref>\n\n=== French East India Company service ===\nWhile d'Estaing was at \u00cele-de-France, word arrived of a prisoner exchange agreement between France and Britain.  D'Estaing, however, was excluded from this agreement because he had been paroled before its date.  While requests were forwarded to India to negotiate his inclusion in the cartel, d'Estaing decided to enter the service of the [[French East India Company]], leading a naval expedition to gather resources for \u00cele-de-France.  D'Estaing thought he would finesse his parole status by declaring himself to be a \"spectator\" in case the force came into conflict with the British or their allies, and permitted his second in command to lead such operations.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 47-48</ref>\n\nIn command of a two-vessel company fleet (the 50-gun ''Cond\u00e9'' and the frigate ''l'Exp\u00e9dition''), d'Estaing sailed for the [[Persian Gulf]] in September 1759.  From an Arab convoy captured at the end of the month, he learnt of a British ship at [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]].  In a daring commando operation, 50 of ''Cond\u00e9''{{'s}} men entered the well-fortified harbour and boarded the ship, taking it without resistance.  In their haste to depart, the men cut lines necessary for towing the ship, and alarm was eventually raised in the port.  A swarm of small boats was driven off by precision fire from ''Cond\u00e9'', allowing a new line to be attached to the prize so that she could be towed out of the harbour.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 48-54</ref>  D'Estaing then destroyed the British [[factory (trading post)|factory]] at [[Bandar-Abbas]],<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 55-59</ref> before sailing for [[Sumatra]].  While en route he detached his accumulated prize ships, sending them to \u00cele-de-France.  D'Estaing's success was notable: in three months he had acquired significant prizes at the expense of only five casualties (28 men died of [[smallpox]]).<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nAfter a slow crossing (retarded by calms and contrary winds), d'Estaing's fleet reached the coast of Sumatra in early February 1760.  There he captured the British factory at [[Natal, North Sumatra|Natal]], which he eventually turned over to the Dutch. He sailed for the British outpost at Tappanooly (present-day [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] in the Indonesian Province of [[North Sumatra]]).  Its commander put up stiff resistance, fleeing into the hills when it was clear the French would be victorious.  D'Estaing consequently decided to destroy the fortifications rather than hunt down the British.  He next sailed for [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], a major Dutch settlement, where he supplemented his forces with local recruits and resupplied.  \n\nHe sailed for [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]] (now [[Bengkulu]], the capital of the Indonesian [[Province of Bengkulu]]), the main British settlement on Sumatra.  The town was defended by [[Fort Marlborough]] and a garrison of 500 Europeans and local [[sepoy]]s, with the potential to raise over 1,000 additional Malay militia.  Although these forces were alerted to the French arrival by a ship that d'Estaing chased into the harbour, the first broadside directed at the fort panicked its defenders, who fled into the surrounding jungle.  D'Estaing spent a day in pursuit of some of these troops.  He used Fort Marlborough as a base to subdue the remaining lesser British settlements on the west side of Sumatra.  He returned to \u00cele-de-France ten months after his departure.\n\nOrdered back to France, d'Estaing boarded a westbound company ship.  Just off the French coast the ship was captured by British patrols.  He was imprisoned at [[Plymouth]], charged with violating his parole, before being granted limited freedom from a house in London.  He was able to successfully defend himself against the charges, and was allowed to return to France.  Upon his arrival, d'Estaing was commissioned as [[field marshal]], the reward for his service in the East Indies.\n\n== Interwar years ==\n\n=== Governor of the Leeward Islands ===\nIn the early months of 1762 France made preparations for a major expedition against [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories in [[South America]]. Promoted to lieutenant general of the army on July 25, 1762, d'Estaing was also given the rank of [[chef d'escadre]] (rear admiral) in the [[French Navy]] in recognition for his exploits, a rank lesser than that he held in the army. In order to clarify his command role in the expedition, the king formally removed him from the army and gave him the rank of lieutenant general in the navy. The expedition was called off when preliminary peace terms were agreed.\n\nIn 1764 King Louis appointed d'Estaing governor general of the French [[Leeward Islands]], a post he held until 1766. Based principally in [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), he recruited [[Acadians]] to settle there. They had been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled from their homeland]] in present-day Canada by the British during the war, as they had refused to take loyalty oaths to the British. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, as many Acadians died of tropical disease. Others sought to resettle elsewhere because of the hot climate and poor land.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Home service ===\nD'Estaing returned to France in 1767.  At this time he had to deal with the formal separation from his wife, which they had agreed to in writing in 1756, before his departure for India.  The division of their properties was somewhat contentious, leading to court proceedings and appeals that ultimately failed to divide their estates.\n\nIn 1772 d'Estaing was appointed naval inspector and governor at [[Brest, France|Brest]], the country's principal Atlantic naval station.  In 1777 he was promoted to vice admiral of the Asian and American seas (''vice-amiral des mers d'Asie et d'Am\u00e9rique'').\n\n== American War of Independence ==\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance|Anglo-French War (1778\u201383)}}\n[[File:Charles Henri d'Estaing 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Le Destin molestant les Anglois'', contemporary caricature showing d'Estaing presenting a palm frond to America]]\nAt the entry of France into the [[American War of Independence]] in 1778, D'Estaing left [[Toulon]] in command of a fleet of twelve [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and four [[frigate]]s. He intended to assist the American colonies against Great Britain. He sailed on 13 April, and, between the 11th and the 22nd of July, blockaded the smaller British fleet of [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] at [[Sandy Hook]],<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Estaing, Charles Hector, Comte d' |volume=9 |page=789 |inline=1}}</ref> [[New Jersey]], off the southern entrance to [[New York harbor|New York harbour]]. He did not enter the harbour because his largest ships were believed to be unable to clear the bar at its mouth.\n\n=== Newport ===\n{{Main|Battle of Rhode Island}}\nIn cooperation with the American generals, d'Estaing planned an attack on [[Newport, Rhode Island]], preparatory to which he compelled the British to destroy some war vessels that were in the harbor. Before the concerted attack could take place, he put to sea against the British fleet, which was under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Howe]].  Owing to a violent storm, which arose suddenly and compelled the two fleets to separate before engaging in battle, many of his vessels were so shattered that he found it necessary to put into [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] for repairs.  He sailed for the [[West Indies]] on 4 November.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== West Indies ===\n{{Main|Battle of St. Lucia|Capture of Grenada|Battle of Grenada}}\nHe arrived in the West Indies in December 1778, shortly after the British began operations to [[Capture of St. Lucia|capture St. Lucia]].  He sailed in an attempt to relieve the place, but he [[Battle of St. Lucia|was defeated]] in both land and naval efforts to prevent its capture.  \n\nIn June 1779, with his fleet reinforced by arrival of ten ships of the line commanded by [[Comte de Grasse]], he took advantage of the temporary absence of his British opponent, Admiral [[John Byron]], to take action against nearby British possessions.  He first detached forces that [[Capture of Saint Vincent|captured St. Vincent]] on 18 June, and then set sail with his entire fleet, intending to capture [[Barbados]].  When he was unable to make progress against the prevailing westerly [[trade winds]], he turned his sights on [[Grenada]].  On 2 July he arrived off the island, which his forces [[Capture of Grenada|took by storm]] two days later.\n\nAdmiral Byron had been alerted to the capture of St. Vincent, and was sailing with a force to retake it when he learned that d'Estaing was at Grenada.  He changed course, making all sail for Grenada, and arrived there early on 6 July.  Although d'Estaing had been alerted to Byron's progress, and his fleet outnumbered Byron's, he still scrambled to embark soldiers and sail away from the island.  Byron, unaware that d'Estaing had been reinforced, ordered a general chase, which resulted in [[Battle of Grenada|a somewhat disorganized battle]].<ref>Stephens, pp.363-364</ref>  D'Estaing refused to press his numerical advantage, and both fleets ended up retiring to their bases for repairs.  In August, d'Estaing sailed for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]], to join forces with the Americans who wanted to recapture the British-held city.\n\n=== Siege of Savannah ===\n{{Main|Siege of Savannah}}\n\n[[File:Bonaventure_Plantation_1779.png|thumb|An October 1779 map by Antoine O'Connor, d'Estaing's chief engineer, of the coastline to the east of the Savannah colony, including [[Bonaventure Plantation]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_hxaDPBdd8kC&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=antoine+o%27connor+engineer&source=bl&ots=DEXddG3f7G&sig=ACfU3U3SZmwnDL6gKWUU2RT1yGmXaWjOpw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-3PGIh-voAhWUUs0KHcLzDdcQ6AEwAHoECAUQKQ#v=onepage&q=antoine%20o'connor%20engineer&f=false ''Engineers of Independence: A Documentary History of the Army Engineers in the American Revolution, 1775-1783'', Paul K. Walker; The Minerva Group, 2002]</ref>]]\n\nThe siege consisted of a joint [[France|Franco]]-[[United States|American]] attempt to retake Savannah from 16 September 1779 to 18 October 1779, with d'Estaing in overall command of the combined forces. After weeks of fruitless bombardment, on 9 October 1779, a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, d'Estaing was twice wounded. When the assault failed, d'Estaing lifted the siege.  British forces remained in control of coastal [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] until they withdrew near the end of the war.\n\n== Return to France ==\n[[File:CharlesComtedestaing.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]\nD'Estaing returned to France in 1780 on [[crutches]].  He fell into disfavour at the court, and was strongly criticised by his subordinates. Friends of [[Benjamin Franklin]], then minister in France, jokingly suggested that the French court at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] should provide America with the names of other gifted admirals.<ref>Schiff p.220</ref> \n\nIn 1781 France sent a fleet under [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]], along with [[Exp\u00e9dition Particuli\u00e8re|an expeditionary force]] to reinforce the Americans in Virginia. Admiral de Grasse defeated the British in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], holding a blockade against their forces and contributing to the surrender of the British army [[Siege of Yorktown|at Yorktown]] in 1781. \n\nThree years later, d'Estaing was placed at the head of the Franco-Spanish fleet assembled before [[C\u00e1diz]]. The peace between the US, Great Britain and France was signed, and no operations took place.\n\nOn September 28, 1784 Governor [[John Houstoun]] of Georgia granted four 5000-acre tracts of vacant land in [[Franklin County, Georgia]] to d'Estaing and his heirs.\n\nAfter the American war, d'Estaing turned his attention to politics. He was made a [[grandee of Spain]]. In 1787, he was elected to the [[Assembly of Notables]]. When the [[French Revolution]] broke out, he supported the revolutionary cause. In 1789, he was appointed as commanding general of the Versailles National Guard, and in 1792 he was promoted to admiral's rank by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. While supporting liberal reforms, he stayed loyal to the royal family. In the 1793 trial of [[Marie Antoinette]], during the [[Reign of Terror]], he testified in her favour. On this account, and because of certain friendly letters which had passed between him and the queen, he was himself brought to trial, charged with being a reactionary. He was sent to the [[guillotine]] on 28 April 1794.<ref name=EB1911/> Before his execution, d'Estaing wrote, \"After my head falls off, send it to the British, they will pay a good deal for it!\"<ref>''Quand vous aurez fait tomber ma t\u00eate, envoyez l\u00e0 aux Anglais, ils la paieront cher!''.

He began his service as a soldier in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], briefly spending time as a [[prisoner of war]] of the British during the [[Seven Years' War]].  Naval exploits during the latter war prompted him to change branches of service, and he transferred to the [[French Navy]].\n\nFollowing France's entry into the [[American War of Independence]] in 1778, d'Estaing led a fleet to aid the American rebels. He participated in a failed Franco-American [[Battle of Rhode Island|siege of Newport, Rhode Island]] in 1778 and the equally unsuccessful 1779 [[Siege of Savannah]]. He did have success in the Caribbean before returning to France in 1780.  His difficulties working with American counterparts are cited among the reasons these operations in North America failed.\n\nAlthough d'Estaing sympathized with revolutionaries during the [[French Revolution]], he held a personal loyalty to the French royal family.

Pigot offered to release him on [[parole]], but d'Estaing refused, preferring instead to be exchanged so that he could resume fighting.<ref>Colman-Maison,  p. 44</ref>  The arrival of a British fleet off Madras in February 1759 convinced d'Estaing to accept the offer of parole, which was conditioned on his not fighting against the British in the East Indies.<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 45</ref>  In May 1759 he sailed for \u00cele-de-France (present-day [[Mauritius]]).<ref>Colman-Maison, p. 46</ref>\n\n=== French East India Company service ===\nWhile d'Estaing was at \u00cele-de-France, word arrived of a prisoner exchange agreement between France and Britain.  D'Estaing, however, was excluded from this agreement because he had been paroled before its date.  While requests were forwarded to India to negotiate his inclusion in the cartel, d'Estaing decided to enter the service of the [[French East India Company]], leading a naval expedition to gather resources for \u00cele-de-France.  D'Estaing thought he would finesse his parole status by declaring himself to be a \"spectator\" in case the force came into conflict with the British or their allies, and permitted his second in command to lead such operations.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 47-48</ref>\n\nIn command of a two-vessel company fleet (the 50-gun ''Cond\u00e9'' and the frigate ''l'Exp\u00e9dition''), d'Estaing sailed for the [[Persian Gulf]] in September 1759.  From an Arab convoy captured at the end of the month, he learnt of a British ship at [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]].  In a daring commando operation, 50 of ''Cond\u00e9''{{'s}} men entered the well-fortified harbour and boarded the ship, taking it without resistance.  In their haste to depart, the men cut lines necessary for towing the ship, and alarm was eventually raised in the port.  A swarm of small boats was driven off by precision fire from ''Cond\u00e9'', allowing a new line to be attached to the prize so that she could be towed out of the harbour.<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 48-54</ref>  D'Estaing then destroyed the British [[factory (trading post)|factory]] at [[Bandar-Abbas]],<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 55-59</ref> before sailing for [[Sumatra]].  While en route he detached his accumulated prize ships, sending them to \u00cele-de-France.  D'Estaing's success was notable: in three months he had acquired significant prizes at the expense of only five casualties (28 men died of [[smallpox]]).<ref>Colman-Maison, pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nAfter a slow crossing (retarded by calms and contrary winds), d'Estaing's fleet reached the coast of Sumatra in early February 1760.  There he captured the British factory at [[Natal, North Sumatra|Natal]], which he eventually turned over to the Dutch. He sailed for the British outpost at Tappanooly (present-day [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] in the Indonesian Province of [[North Sumatra]]).  Its commander put up stiff resistance, fleeing into the hills when it was clear the French would be victorious.  D'Estaing consequently decided to destroy the fortifications rather than hunt down the British.  He next sailed for [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], a major Dutch settlement, where he supplemented his forces with local recruits and resupplied.  \n\nHe sailed for [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]] (now [[Bengkulu]], the capital of the Indonesian [[Province of Bengkulu]]), the main British settlement on Sumatra.  The town was defended by [[Fort Marlborough]] and a garrison of 500 Europeans and local [[sepoy]]s, with the potential to raise over 1,000 additional Malay militia.  Although these forces were alerted to the French arrival by a ship that d'Estaing chased into the harbour, the first broadside directed at the fort panicked its defenders, who fled into the surrounding jungle.  D'Estaing spent a day in pursuit of some of these troops.  He used Fort Marlborough as a base to subdue the remaining lesser British settlements on the west side of Sumatra.  He returned to \u00cele-de-France ten months after his departure.\n\nOrdered back to France, d'Estaing boarded a westbound company ship.  Just off the French coast the ship was captured by British patrols.  He was imprisoned at [[Plymouth]], charged with violating his parole, before being granted limited freedom from a house in London.  He was able to successfully defend himself against the charges, and was allowed to return to France.  Upon his arrival, d'Estaing was commissioned as [[field marshal]], the reward for his service in the East Indies.\n\n== Interwar years ==\n\n=== Governor of the Leeward Islands ===\nIn the early months of 1762 France made preparations for a major expedition against [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories in [[South America]]. Promoted to lieutenant general of the army on July 25, 1762, d'Estaing was also given the rank of [[chef d'escadre]] (rear admiral) in the [[French Navy]] in recognition for his exploits, a rank lesser than that he held in the army. In order to clarify his command role in the expedition, the king formally removed him from the army and gave him the rank of lieutenant general in the navy. The expedition was called off when preliminary peace terms were agreed.\n\nIn 1764 King Louis appointed d'Estaing governor general of the French [[Leeward Islands]], a post he held until 1766. Based principally in [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), he recruited [[Acadians]] to settle there. They had been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled from their homeland]] in present-day Canada by the British during the war, as they had refused to take loyalty oaths to the British. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, as many Acadians died of tropical disease. Others sought to resettle elsewhere because of the hot climate and poor land.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Home service ===\nD'Estaing returned to France in 1767.  At this time he had to deal with the formal separation from his wife, which they had agreed to in writing in 1756, before his departure for India.  The division of their properties was somewhat contentious, leading to court proceedings and appeals that ultimately failed to divide their estates.\n\nIn 1772 d'Estaing was appointed naval inspector and governor at [[Brest, France|Brest]], the country's principal Atlantic naval station.  In 1777 he was promoted to vice admiral of the Asian and American seas (''vice-amiral des mers d'Asie et d'Am\u00e9rique'').\n\n== American War of Independence ==\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance|Anglo-French War (1778\u201383)}}\n[[File:Charles Henri d'Estaing 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Le Destin molestant les Anglois'', contemporary caricature showing d'Estaing presenting a palm frond to America]]\nAt the entry of France into the [[American War of Independence]] in 1778, D'Estaing left [[Toulon]] in command of a fleet of twelve [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and four [[frigate]]s. He intended to assist the American colonies against Great Britain. He sailed on 13 April, and, between the 11th and the 22nd of July, blockaded the smaller British fleet of [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] at [[Sandy Hook]],<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Estaing, Charles Hector, Comte d' |volume=9 |page=789 |inline=1}}</ref> [[New Jersey]], off the southern entrance to [[New York harbor|New York harbour]]. He did not enter the harbour because his largest ships were believed to be unable to clear the bar at its mouth.\n\n=== Newport ===\n{{Main|Battle of Rhode Island}}\nIn cooperation with the American generals, d'Estaing planned an attack on [[Newport, Rhode Island]], preparatory to which he compelled the British to destroy some war vessels that were in the harbor. Before the concerted attack could take place, he put to sea against the British fleet, which was under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Howe]].  Owing to a violent storm, which arose suddenly and compelled the two fleets to separate before engaging in battle, many of his vessels were so shattered that he found it necessary to put into [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] for repairs.  He sailed for the [[West Indies]] on 4 November.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== West Indies ===\n{{Main|Battle of St. Lucia|Capture of Grenada|Battle of Grenada}}\nHe arrived in the West Indies in December 1778, shortly after the British began operations to [[Capture of St. Lucia|capture St. Lucia]].  He sailed in an attempt to relieve the place, but he [[Battle of St. Lucia|was defeated]] in both land and naval efforts to prevent its capture.  \n\nIn June 1779, with his fleet reinforced by arrival of ten ships of the line commanded by [[Comte de Grasse]], he took advantage of the temporary absence of his British opponent, Admiral [[John Byron]], to take action against nearby British possessions.  He first detached forces that [[Capture of Saint Vincent|captured St. Vincent]] on 18 June, and then set sail with his entire fleet, intending to capture [[Barbados]].  When he was unable to make progress against the prevailing westerly [[trade winds]], he turned his sights on [[Grenada]].  On 2 July he arrived off the island, which his forces [[Capture of Grenada|took by storm]] two days later.\n\nAdmiral Byron had been alerted to the capture of St. Vincent, and was sailing with a force to retake it when he learned that d'Estaing was at Grenada.  He changed course, making all sail for Grenada, and arrived there early on 6 July.  Although d'Estaing had been alerted to Byron's progress, and his fleet outnumbered Byron's, he still scrambled to embark soldiers and sail away from the island.  Byron, unaware that d'Estaing had been reinforced, ordered a general chase, which resulted in [[Battle of Grenada|a somewhat disorganized battle]].<ref>Stephens, pp.363-364</ref>  D'Estaing refused to press his numerical advantage, and both fleets ended up retiring to their bases for repairs.  In August, d'Estaing sailed for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]], to join forces with the Americans who wanted to recapture the British-held city.\n\n=== Siege of Savannah ===\n{{Main|Siege of Savannah}}\n\n[[File:Bonaventure_Plantation_1779.png|thumb|An October 1779 map by Antoine O'Connor, d'Estaing's chief engineer, of the coastline to the east of the Savannah colony, including[[Bonaventure Plantation]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_hxaDPBdd8kC&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=antoine+o%27connor+engineer&source=bl&ots=DEXddG3f7G&sig=ACfU3U3SZmwnDL6gKWUU2RT1yGmXaWjOpw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-3PGIh-voAhWUUs0KHcLzDdcQ6AEwAHoECAUQKQ#v=onepage&q=antoine%20o'connor%20engineer&f=false ''Engineers of Independence: A Documentary History of the Army Engineers in the American Revolution, 1775-1783'', Paul K. Walker; The Minerva Group, 2002]</ref>]]\n\nThe siege consisted of a joint [[France|Franco]]-[[United States|American]] attempt to retake Savannah from 16 September 1779 to 18 October 1779, with d'Estaing in overall command of the combined forces. After weeks of fruitless bombardment, on 9 October 1779, a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, d'Estaing was twice wounded. When the assault failed, d'Estaing lifted the siege.  British forces remained in control of coastal [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] until they withdrew near the end of the war.\n\n== Return to France ==\n[[File:CharlesComtedestaing.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]\nD'Estaing returned to France in 1780 on [[crutches]].  He fell into disfavour at the court, and was strongly criticised by his subordinates. Friends of [[Benjamin Franklin]], then minister in France, jokingly suggested that the French court at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] should provide America with the names of other gifted admirals.<ref>Schiff p.220</ref> \n\nIn 1781 France sent a fleet under [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]], along with [[Exp\u00e9dition Particuli\u00e8re|an expeditionary force]] to reinforce the Americans in Virginia. Admiral de Grasse defeated the British in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], holding a blockade against their forces and contributing to the surrender of the British army [[Siege of Yorktown|at Yorktown]] in 1781. \n\nThree years later, d'Estaing was placed at the head of the Franco-Spanish fleet assembled before [[C\u00e1diz]]. The peace between the US, Great Britain and France was signed, and no operations took place.\n\nOn September 28, 1784 Governor [[John Houstoun]] of Georgia granted four 5000-acre tracts of vacant land in [[Franklin County, Georgia]] to d'Estaing and his heirs.\n\nAfter the American war, d'Estaing turned his attention to politics. He was made a [[grandee of Spain]]. In 1787, he was elected to the [[Assembly of Notables]]. When the [[French Revolution]] broke out, he supported the revolutionary cause. In 1789, he was appointed as commanding general of the Versailles National Guard, and in 1792 he was promoted to admiral's rank by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. While supporting liberal reforms, he stayed loyal to the royal family. In the 1793 trial of [[Marie Antoinette]], during the [[Reign of Terror]], he testified in her favour. On this account, and because of certain friendly letters which had passed between him and the queen, he was himself brought to trial, charged with being a reactionary. He was sent to the [[guillotine]] on 28 April 1794.<ref name=EB1911/> Before his execution, d'Estaing wrote, \"After my head falls off, send it to the British, they will pay a good deal for it!\"<ref>''Quand vous aurez fait tomber ma t\u00eate, envoyez l\u00e0 aux Anglais, ils la paieront cher!''.

The event consists of two nights of live bands (Friday and Saturday) at the town's largest venue, The Spa Pavilion, and three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) of alternative trade stalls at the Spa Pavilion, Whitby Leisure Centre, and Whitby Brunswick Centre.\n\nThe term \"Whitby Goth Weekend\" is sometimes used as a [[generic trademark|generic]] term to describe events during the week in Whitby as a whole, although the name of the event and its associated logo are [[registered trademark]]s of Jo Hampshire of Top Mum Promotions.<ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002598441 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00002598441: Whitby Goth Weekend\n  |date=3 February 2012\n  |website=[[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|IPO]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002608916 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00002608916: WGW\n  |date=18 May 2012\n  |website=IPO\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002608920 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00002608920: logotype\n  |date=1 June 2012\n  |website=IPO \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00003016493 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00003016493: Whitby Gothic Weekend\n  |date=8 November 2013\n  |website=IPO \n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Screaming Banshee Aircrew WGW April 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Screaming Banshee Aircrew on stage at Whitby Goth Weekend, April 2005]]\n[[File:Uninvited Guest WGW October 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Uninvited Guest on stage at Whitby Goth Weekend, October 2006]]\nThe origins of WGW are in a meeting of around forty of Hampshire's pen-pals in 1994.<ref name=\":DS:\">{{cite news|title=Goths descend on town to celebrate weekend|work=Darlington & Stockton Times|issue=2017-17|date=28 April 2017|page=22|editor-last=Richardson|editor-first=Andy|issn=2040-3933}}</ref> The first meeting was held in the Elsinore public house in Whitby, which, with the Little Angel, continues to be a meeting point during the weekend.<ref name=\"wgwhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitbygothweekend.co.uk/FAQ.php|title=Whitbygothweekend.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> Hampshire said Whitby was chosen for its [[Dracula]] connections, although probably more so because the connection had already fostered a sense of acceptance on the part of locals and businesses rather than any inherent romanticism regarding the location.<ref name=\"wgwhistory\"/>\n\nThe festival was held yearly until 1997, when it became twice-yearly in April and October. It has grown into one of the world's most popular [[Goth subculture|goth]] music events with thousands of attendees from across the UK and beyond. The main event was held in the town's largest venue Whitby Spa Pavilion<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/fears-its-the-beginning-end-14792054|title=Fears it's 'the beginning of the end' for Whitby Goth Weekend|first=Laura|last=Love|date=16 June 2018|work=Gazette Live|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> (known as the Spa) and the Bizarre Bazaar 'Goth Market' is also held there and at Whitby Leisure Centre and the Brunswick Centre.<ref name=\":DS:\" /> Access to the Spa in the evening required a ticket and live bands played on both Friday and Saturday from 08:00 until about midnight.\n\nThe Metropole was often used as an overspill venue for the Spa, with bands due to play the next evening/or playing from the previous evening. In recent years it has been used as a venue for the markets as well as the clubs, Manic Monday and Sexy Sunday. RAW Nightclub and Abbey Wharf are used for official fringe events; other venues including The Resolution, The Rifle Club, and The Metropole are used for unofficial events.\n\nFor many years there was an 80's night held at Laughtons, a genuine venue from the 1980s. The night would traditionally end with the song [[New Model Army (band)|Vagabonds]]. In 2010 this venue became a Wetherspoons Hotel, but the lineal descendant of the 80's night continues to take place on the Sunday night.\n\nThe \"weekend\" starts during the day on Friday and fringe events are held on Thursday, Sunday and Monday including club nights, markets, and a charity football match between visiting goth team Real Gothic, and local team Stokoemotiv Whitby. During the October/November event there is an independent custom car show, 'Whitby Kustom' in the grounds of West Cliff School. There are also several \"meet ups\" aimed at goths with a particular interest, e.g. [[Lolita fashion|Lolita Goth]].\n\nNewbies who have not attended the event before are referred to as \"Whitby Virgins\". To help introduce them to the event, there was a WGW Virgins Meet Up on the Friday morning at the Spa until about 2014.\n\nIn June 2018 there was a breakdown in the relationship between WGW and SIV Live, who operate the Spa. WGW was therefore unable to book the Spa for bands for October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theblogginggoth.com/2018/06/15/pavilion-parts-ways-with-whitby-goth-weekend-promoter/|title=Pavilion parts ways with Whitby Goth Weekend promoter|work=The Blogging Goth|date=15 June 2018|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> In July a new promoter was found to put bands on at the Spa in October.

The weekend now attracts other alternative [[subcultures]], including Victorian vampires, [[Rock music|rockers]], [[Punk subculture|punks]] and members of the [[steampunk]] [[subgenre]]. Some regulars consider it no longer a purely \"Goth\" weekend, and it was acknowledged by Hampshire in the 2014 Whitby Goth Weekend Guide that in order to survive the event would have to diversify into other areas that have influenced Goth.\n\nConcerns have grown about disrespect being shown to the graves in St. Mary's Churchyard by photographers using them for photographic purposes which has resulted in a petition to have the area closed during the event. The proposal was supported by Whitby Goth Weekend, saying that \"behaviour displayed in the churchyard is disrespectful and offensive\".<ref>{{cite

'''Whitby''', is a twice-yearly music festival for the [[Goth subculture|gothic subculture]], in [[Whitby]], [[North Yorkshire]], England, organised by Jo Hampshire.\n\n==Summary==\nWhitby Goth Weekend is an alternative music festival held in Whitby. The event consists of two nights of live bands (Friday and Saturday) at the town's largest venue, The Spa Pavilion, and three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) of alternative trade stalls at the Spa Pavilion, Whitby Leisure Centre, and Whitby Brunswick Centre.\n\nThe term \"Whitby Goth Weekend\" is sometimes used as a [[generic trademark|generic]] term to describe events during the week in Whitby as a whole, although the name of the event and its associated logo are [[registered trademark]]s of Jo Hampshire of Top Mum Promotions.<ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002598441 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00002598441: Whitby Goth Weekend\n  |date=3 February 2012\n  |website=[[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|IPO]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002608916 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00002608916: WGW\n  |date=18 May 2012\n  |website=IPO\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002608920 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00002608920: logotype\n  |date=1 June 2012\n  |website=IPO \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00003016493 \n  |title=Case details for trade mark UK00003016493: Whitby Gothic Weekend\n  |date=8 November 2013\n  |website=IPO \n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Screaming Banshee Aircrew WGW April 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Screaming Banshee Aircrew on stage at Whitby Goth Weekend, April 2005]]\n[[File:Uninvited Guest WGW October 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Uninvited Guest on stage at Whitby Goth Weekend, October 2006]]\nThe origins of WGW are in a meeting of around forty of Hampshire's pen-pals in 1994.<ref name=\":DS:\">{{cite news|title=Goths descend on town to celebrate weekend|work=Darlington & Stockton Times|issue=2017-17|date=28 April 2017|page=22|editor-last=Richardson|editor-first=Andy|issn=2040-3933}}</ref> The first meeting was held in the Elsinore public house in Whitby, which, with the Little Angel, continues to be a meeting point during the weekend.<ref name=\"wgwhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitbygothweekend.co.uk/FAQ.php|title=Whitbygothweekend.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> Hampshire said Whitby was chosen for its [[Dracula]] connections, although probably more so because the connection had already fostered a sense of acceptance on the part of locals and businesses rather than any inherent romanticism regarding the location.<ref name=\"wgwhistory\"/>\n\nThe festival was held yearly until 1997, when it became twice-yearly in April and October. It has grown into one of the world's most popular [[Goth subculture|goth]] music events with thousands of attendees from across the UK and beyond. The main event was held in the town's largest venue Whitby Spa Pavilion<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/fears-its-the-beginning-end-14792054|title=Fears it's 'the beginning of the end' for Whitby Goth Weekend|first=Laura|last=Love|date=16 June 2018|work=Gazette Live|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> (known as the Spa) and the Bizarre Bazaar 'Goth Market' is also held there and at Whitby Leisure Centre and the Brunswick Centre.<ref name=\":DS:\" /> Access to the Spa in the evening required a ticket and live bands played on both Friday and Saturday from 08:00 until about midnight.\n\nThe Metropole was often used as an overspill venue for the Spa, with bands due to play the next evening/or playing from the previous evening. In recent years it has been used as a venue for the markets as well as the clubs, Manic Monday and Sexy Sunday. RAW Nightclub and Abbey Wharf are used for official fringe events; other venues including The Resolution, The Rifle Club, and The Metropole are used for unofficial events.\n\nFor many years there was an 80's night held at Laughtons, a genuine venue from the 1980s. The night would traditionally end with the song [[New Model Army (band)|Vagabonds]]. In 2010 this venue became a Wetherspoons Hotel, but the lineal descendant of the 80's night continues to take place on the Sunday night.\n\nThe \"weekend\" starts during the day on Friday and fringe events are held on Thursday, Sunday and Monday including club nights, markets, and a charity football match between visiting goth team Real Gothic, and local team Stokoemotiv Whitby. During the October/November event there is an independent custom car show, 'Whitby Kustom' in the grounds of West Cliff School. There are also several \"meet ups\" aimed at goths with a particular interest, e.g. [[Lolita fashion|Lolita Goth]].\n\nNewbies who have not attended the event before are referred to as \"Whitby Virgins\". To help introduce them to the event, there was a WGW Virgins Meet Up on the Friday morning at the Spa until about 2014.\n\nIn June 2018 there was a breakdown in the relationship between WGW and SIV Live, who operate the Spa. WGW was therefore unable to book the Spa for bands for October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theblogginggoth.com/2018/06/15/pavilion-parts-ways-with-whitby-goth-weekend-promoter/|title=Pavilion parts ways with Whitby Goth Weekend promoter|work=The Blogging Goth|date=15 June 2018|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> In July a new promoter was found to put bands on at the Spa in October.

The weekend now attracts other alternative [[subcultures]], including Victorian vampires, [[Rock music|rockers]], [[Punk subculture|punks]] and members of the [[steampunk]] [[subgenre]]. Some regulars consider it no longer a purely \"Goth\" weekend, and it was acknowledged by Hampshire in the 2014 Whitby Goth Weekend Guide that in order to survive the event would have to diversify into other areas that have influenced Goth.\n\nConcerns have grown about disrespect being shown to the graves in St. Mary's Churchyard by photographers using them for photographic purposes which has resulted in a petition to have the area closed during the event. The proposal was supported by Whitby Goth Weekend, saying that \"behaviour displayed in the churchyard is disrespectful and offensive\".<ref>{{cite

Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

and [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 13 October to 25 November 1965. Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

A statement on the band's site relates: \"We're so psyched about [the new album] that we wanted to give all you guys, the true Korn fans \u2014 a gift from us.\" Also at this time, the band attempted to start an online [[Chain letter|chain email]], by posting the letter online and asking fans to email the letter to 10 other people and to then sign the \"I Downloaded the Korn Single For Free\" guestbook on the band's site. For each person who signed, Korn donated 25 cents to the charities Childhelp USA and Children Of The Night.

The band admits that with [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] working alongside them, they were more focused during recording because he didn't let them just fool around and party, so there was a lot less drinking this time around.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = Dead\n| length1 = 1:12\n| title2 = [[Falling Away from Me]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = Trash\n| length3 = 3:27\n| title4 = 4 U\n| length4 = 1:42\n| title5 = Beg for Me\n| length5 = 3:53\n| title6 = [[Make Me Bad]]\n| length6 = 3:55\n| title7 = It's Gonna Go Away\n| length7 = 1:29\n| title8 = Wake Up\n| length8 = 4:07\n| title9 = Am I Going Crazy\n| length9 = 1:00\n| title10 = Hey Daddy\n| length10 = 3:44\n| title11 = [[Somebody Someone]]\n| length11 = 3:47\n| title12 = No Way\n| length12 = 4:07\n| title13 = Let's Get This Party Started\n| length13 = 3:41\n| title14 = Wish You Could Be Me\n| length14 = 1:07\n| title15 = Counting\n| length15 = 3:37\n| title16 = Dirty\n| length16 = 7:50\n|total_length = 53:16\n}}\n*The song \"Dirty\" ends at 3:43 and is followed up by 4 minutes and 7 seconds of static.\n**In the advance version, this song ends at 3:46 without the static, followed by an alternative version of \"Am I Going Crazy\".

The album was promoted throughout 2000 by the band's highly successful [[Sick and Twisted Tour]].\n\n==Recording and production==\n\nDuring one of the band's recording sessions, journalist [[Chris Connelly (journalist)|Chris Connelly]] asked about how the recording was coming along, to which drummer [[David Silveria]] responded that it \"Sounds like the music is a little more simplified and heavier. Kind of heavier grooves, more than the last couple. So kind of more similar to the beginning, except Jon is a much better singer now, so it's all coming together.\"<ref>Connelly, Chris.

A statement on the band's site relates: \"We're so psyched about [the new album] that we wanted to give all you guys, the true Korn fans \u2014 a gift from us.\" Also at this time, the band attempted to start an online [[Chain letter|chain email]], by posting the letter online and asking fans to email the letter to 10 other people and to then sign the \"I Downloaded the Korn Single For Free\" guestbook on the band's site. For each person who signed, Korn donated 25 cents to the charities Childhelp USA and Children Of The Night. It raised over [[United States Dollar|$]]250,000.<ref name=\"free mp3\">Johnson, Tina (1999-10-29).

The band admits that with [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] working alongside them, they were more focused during recording because he didn't let them just fool around and party, so there was a lot less drinking this time around.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = Dead\n| length1 = 1:12\n| title2 = [[Falling Away from Me]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = Trash\n| length3 = 3:27\n| title4 = 4 U\n| length4 = 1:42\n| title5 = Beg for Me\n| length5 = 3:53\n| title6 = [[Make Me Bad]]\n| length6 = 3:55\n| title7 = It's Gonna Go Away\n| length7 = 1:29\n| title8 = Wake Up\n| length8 = 4:07\n| title9 = Am I Going Crazy\n| length9 = 1:00\n| title10 = Hey Daddy\n| length10 = 3:44\n| title11 = [[Somebody Someone]]\n| length11 = 3:47\n| title12 = No Way\n| length12 = 4:07\n| title13 = Let's Get This Party Started\n| length13 = 3:41\n| title14 = Wish You Could Be Me\n| length14 = 1:07\n| title15 = Counting\n| length15 = 3:37\n| title16 = Dirty\n| length16 = 7:50\n|total_length = 53:16\n}}\n*The song \"Dirty\" ends at 3:43 and is followed up by 4 minutes and 7 seconds of static.\n**In the advance version, this song ends at 3:46 without the static, followed by an alternative version of \"Am I Going Crazy\".

{"title_page": "List of dates for Easter", "text_new": "{{Dates for Easter}}  \nThis is a '''list of dates for [[Easter]]'''. The Easter dates also affect when [[Ash Wednesday]], [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], [[Holy Saturday]], [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]] occur, consequently determining the liturgical year except the calendar of saints, feasts of the Anunciation and the nativities of [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist|St. John, the Baptist]] and [[Christmas|Jesus]]. Easter may occur on different dates in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and the [[Julian Calendar]]. The accompanying table provides both sets of dates, for recent decades and forthcoming years \u2014 see the [[computus]] article for more details on the calculation.\n\n== Earliest Easter ==\n===Western (Gregorian)===\n\nIn 1818 the [[Paschal Full Moon]] fell on Saturday, March 21 (the [[equinox]]). Therefore, the following day, March 22, was Easter. It will not fall as early again until 2285, a span of 467 years. The next earliest Easter between 1818 and 2285 (March 23) occurred in 1845, 1856, 1913 and 2008, and will occur again in 2160\u2014an 11, 57, 95 and 152-year gap, respectively.  Easter last occurred on March 24 in 1940 and will not occur on that day until 2391, a 451-year gap.\n\n===Orthodox (Julian)===\n\nThe earliest dates for Easter in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] between 1875 and 2099 are April 4, 1915 and April 4, 2010 (Gregorian). Both dates are equivalent to March 22 in the [[Julian Calendar]].\n\n== Latest Easter ==\n===Western (Gregorian)===\n\nIn 1943 Easter fell on Sunday, April 25. The last [[ecclesiastical full moon]] preceding the [[ecclesiastical full moon|Paschal]] did not occur until Saturday, March 20; prior to March 21, the fixed date to which the vernal equinox is assigned for the purposes of the [[computus]], meaning the Paschal full moon did not happen until Sunday, April 18. Consequently, Easter was the following Sunday (April 25). Easter will not fall as late again until 2038\u2014a span of 95 years. The second latest date for Easter, April 24, occurred in 2011. The last time this occurred was in 1859 and will not happen again until 2095\u2014spans of 152 and 84 years.\n\n===Orthodox (Julian)===\n\nThe latest dates for Orthodox Easter between 1875 and 2099 are May 8, 1983, and May 8, 2078 (Gregorian). Both dates are equivalent to April 25 in the Julian Calendar. Orthodox Easter has never fallen on Gregorian May 7 yet; it will happen in 2051 unless these churches change to another calendar.\n\n== Western and Orthodox Easter on the same date ==\nDespite using calendars that are apart by 13 days, Easter 2014 fell on the same date. According to the Western (Gregorian) calendar, the first Paschal Full Moon after the Spring Equinox (March 20) fell on Monday, April 14, 2014. The following Sunday, April 20, was, therefore, Easter Day.\n\nAccording to the Orthodox (Julian) calendar (which is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar), the Spring Equinox also falls on March 21. However, in the Gregorian Calendar, this is April 3. The first Orthodox Full Moon after the Equinox falls on (Julian) Tuesday, April 2, 2014 (Gregorian April 15). The following Sunday, (Julian) April 7, is, therefore, Easter Day (Gregorian April 20).\n\n== Range of dates for Western and Orthodox Easter ==\nBoth calendars (Gregorian and Julian) calculate Easter as falling on dates between March 22 and April 25 on their calendars. However, because of the 13-day difference, any member of an Orthodox church would observe that the Western Easter falls between March 10 and April 12 on the Julian calendar. Conversely, any member of a Western church would observe that Orthodox Easter falls between April 4 and May 8 on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nBeginning March 14, 2100 (February 29, 2100, in the Julian Calendar), the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars will increase to 14 days.\n\n== Public holidays ==\n{{Expand section|details of Easter holidays in other countries; this section currently only mentions those with a four-day weekend|small=no|date=April 2018}}\nIn [[Hungary]], [[Kenya]], the [[United Kingdom]] (except [[Scotland]]), [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Germany]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[New Zealand]], Easter has two public holidays, [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter Monday]], making a four-day weekend. The moveable date of Easter sometimes brings it into conflict with other, fixed, public holidays.\n*In the United Kingdom in 2000 and 2011, the [[May Day]] bank holiday was one week after Easter Monday, causing there to be three consecutive weeks with a bank holiday. (In Scotland this did not occur as Easter Monday is not a bank holiday.) In 2011, a bank holiday was declared on Friday 29 April for the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/uk/royal-wedding-bank-holiday|title=Royal Wedding Bank Holiday in the United Kingdom|publisher=}}</ref> consequently there were four bank holidays within three consecutive calendar weeks (including two in one week), creating two consecutive four-day weekends (Friday 22 \u2013 Monday 25 April and Friday 29 April \u2013 Monday 2 May), with a three-day working week in between (Tuesday 26 \u2013 Thursday 28 April).\n*In [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 2008, [[Saint Patrick's Day]] (Monday 17 March) fell six days before Easter (Sunday 23 March), creating a three-day week (Tuesday 18 \u2013 Thursday 20 March). This will next happen in 2035, when Saint Patrick's Day falls on Saturday, so the public holiday is moved forward to the following Monday 19 March, again six days before Easter.\n**In the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[liturgical calendar]], saints' feasts are not observed when they fall during [[Holy Week]]; this caused Saint Patrick not to appear in the liturgical calendar for 2008; 17 March was simply celebrated as Holy Monday. In Ireland, the Church chose to celebrate Saint Patrick on Saturday 15 March instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/irish_bishops_move_st._patricks_day_2008_over_conflict_with_holy_week|title=Irish bishops move St. Patrick's Day 2008 over conflict with Holy Week|date=July 19, 2007|website=[[Catholic News Agency]]|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref>\n*In Australia and New Zealand, [[ANZAC Day]] is a public holiday on 25 April. In 2000 and 2011, this created a five-day weekend over Easter: in 2000, Easter Monday fell on 24 April, with the following Tuesday, 25 April, then being ANZAC Day; in 2011, ANZAC Day and Easter Monday coincided on Monday 25 April, which led to a substitute public holiday being declared for Tuesday 26 April.<ref>https://www.officeholidays.com/countries/australia/2011.php</ref> In 2003 and 2014, ANZAC Day fell on the Friday after Easter, and in 2019 it fell on the Thursday after Easter, and in 2038 it will fall on Easter Sunday; the consequence is three-day working weeks immediately following the Easter weekend.\n\n*Easter is not a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]] in the United States.
