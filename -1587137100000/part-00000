His family moved to Paris in 1968 where he attended college at the fashionable [[lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague]], a Jesuit-run school in the Trocadero district. He graduated at the [[Institution Notre-Dame de Sainte-Croix|Sainte-Croix de Neuilly]] college among the French aristocracy. Some of his early works have been influenced by this education among the privileged. His novels show a typical French narrative touch that the critics called \"balzacian\", referring to his obsession with social recognition. His first novel, ''Messieurs'', published in 1979 (and 30 years later ''Votre serviteur'' in 2015) included a vivid description of the French high-society .\n\nWhile attending the [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Paris|Sciences-Po]] in Paris in 1977, he registered a few blocks away at  the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts|Beaux-Arts]] school  in [[sculpture]] and  in the  studio run by {{ill|Claude Viseux|fr|Claude_Viseux|vertical-align=sup}}.\nThough socially involved in Paris, Rome and Venice (''Montefalco'', 1980), he still managed to write a daily column in Le Figaro and published a novel every year, often depicting father/son ambiguous relationships with older churchmen, writers, veterans, war pilots, later portrayed in his autobiographical novel ''Votre Serviteur''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCA8BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Votre serviteur|last=Combaz|first=Christian|date=2015-01-21|publisher=Flammarion|isbn=9782081343665|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nHis literary works in this period included a road-book about Florida, ''Lettres de Floride''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/Lettres-Floride-Olivier-photographies-Christian/dp/B00CSMTOYG|title=Lettres de Floride|last=Christian|first=Martel Olivier Combaz|date=1982-01-01|publisher=Atelier|isbn=9782904108020|location=Orl\u00e9ans}}</ref> A licensed pilot, he was consider making this his career.  He pretended to start a career as a reporter/explorer but soon went back to literature and, this time, got instant recognition. \"This is real art!\", wrote the very influential [[Angelo Rinaldi]] in ''L'Express''.\n\nThough often nominated for the annual literary French awards, he kept living in a secluded village and showed no further interest in Parisian circles .

He still claims to be the voice of \"those who are never listened to\" . His various columns and chronicles have included throughout the years ''[[J'informe]]'', ''[[Le Figaro]]'', ''[[L'Express]]'', ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'', ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'', ''[[Grands Reportages (magazine)|Grands Reportages]]'' (1976-1987) and ''[[Valeurs actuelles]]'' (1995).\n\nHe has also translated in French various novels and essays such as [[Wonder Boys]] by [[Michael Chabon]] or [[The Face of Battle|The face of Battle]] by [[John Keegan]]. He has often stayed in [[New York City]], where his brother was running a business.  A few months before September 11, he wrote a futuristic novel, ''Une heure avant l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/heure-avant-l%C3%A9ternit%C3%A9-Christian-Combaz/dp/2213609713|title=Une heure avant l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9|last=Combaz|first=Christian|publisher=Fayard|isbn=9782213609713|edition=FAYARD.|location=Paris}}</ref> the paperback cover of which prophetically showed the twin towers hacked by a bayonet, picture shot from a New Jersey war monument facing Manhattan.\n\nNo longer able to afford the cost of his flying licence, he took up [[Hang gliding|hang-gliding]] and [[paragliding]].

{"title_page": "Cerium", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|caesium|curium}}\n{{good article}}\n{{short description|chemical element with atomic number 58}}\n{{Infobox cerium}}\n'''Cerium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Ce''' and [[atomic number]] 58. Cerium is a [[hardness|soft]], [[ductile]] and silvery-white [[metal]] that tarnishes when exposed to air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the [[lanthanide]] series, and while it often shows the +3 [[oxidation state]] characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also considered one of the [[rare-earth element]]s. Cerium has no biological role in humans and is not very toxic.\n\nDespite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the [[monazite]] and [[bastn\u00e4site]] groups, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by [[neodymium]], [[lanthanum]], and [[praseodymium]]. It is the 26th-most [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundant element]], making up 66&nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] of the Earth's crust, half as much as [[chlorine]] and five times as much as [[lead]].\n\nCerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered, in [[Bastn\u00e4s]], Sweden, by [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] and [[Wilhelm Hisinger]] in 1803, and independently by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in Germany in the same year. In 1839 [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] became the first to isolate the metal. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, [[cerium(IV) oxide]] is used to polish glass and is an important part of [[catalytic converter]]s. Cerium metal is used in [[ferrocerium]] lighters for its [[pyrophoric]] properties. Cerium-doped [[YAG]] phosphor is used in conjunction with blue [[light-emitting diode]]s to produce white light in most commercial white LED light sources.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n=== Physical ===\nCerium is the second element of the [[lanthanide]] series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides [[lanthanum]] to its left and [[praseodymium]] to its right, and above the [[actinide]] [[thorium]]. It is a [[ductile]] metal with a hardness similar to that of [[silver]].<ref name=CRC>{{RubberBible86th}}</ref> Its 58 electrons are arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] [Xe]4f<sup>1</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>, of which the four outer electrons are [[valence electron]]s. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] suddenly contract and are lowered in energy to the point that they participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d [[electron shell#subshells|subshell]] is still occupied.<ref name=Greenwood1232>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1232\u20135</ref> Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce<sup>4+</sup> and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until [[neodymium]] to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron by chemical means.<ref name=Holleman>{{Holleman&Wiberg|pages=1703\u20135}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cerium phase diagram.jpg|Phase diagram of cerium|upright=1.4|center|thumb]]\n\nFour [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms of cerium are known to exist at standard pressure, and are given the common labels of \u03b1 to \u03b4:<ref name=KGP>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-0248(74)90098-0| title = Preparation of single phase \u03b2 and \u03b1 cerium samples for low temperature measurements| journal = Journal of Crystal Growth| volume = 22| issue = 3| pages = 225\u2013229| year = 1974| last1 = Koskimaki | first1 = D.

The energy of the 4f electron is nearly the same as that of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johansson |first=B\u00f6rje |last2=Luo |first2=Wei |first3=Sa |last3=Li |first4=Rajeev |last4=Ahuja |date=17 September 2014 |title=Cerium; Crystal Structure and Position in The Periodic Table |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=4 |doi=10.1038/srep06398 |pages=6398|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E6398J |pmid=25227991 |pmc=4165975}}</ref>\n\nAt lower temperatures the behavior of cerium is complicated by the slow rates of transformation.

All four are [[observationally stable]], though the light isotopes <sup>136</sup>Ce and <sup>138</sup>Ce are theoretically expected to undergo inverse [[double beta decay]] to isotopes of [[barium]], and the heaviest isotope <sup>142</sup>Ce is expected to undergo double beta decay to <sup>142</sup>Nd or alpha decay to <sup>138</sup>Ba. Additionally, <sup>140</sup>Ce would release energy upon [[spontaneous fission]]. None of these decay modes have yet been observed, though the double beta decay of <sup>136</sup>Ce, <sup>138</sup>Ce, and <sup>142</sup>Ce have been experimentally searched for. The current experimental limits for their half-lives are:{{NUBASE2016|ref}}\n:<sup>136</sup>Ce: &gt;3.8\u00d710<sup>16</sup> y\n:<sup>138</sup>Ce: &gt;5.7\u00d710<sup>16</sup> y\n:<sup>142</sup>Ce: &gt;5.0\u00d710<sup>16</sup> y\n\nAll other cerium isotopes are [[synthetic radioisotope|synthetic]] and [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. The most stable of them are <sup>144</sup>Ce with a half-life of 284.9&nbsp;days, <sup>139</sup>Ce with a half-life of 137.6&nbsp;days, <sup>143</sup>Ce with a half-life of 33.04&nbsp;days, and <sup>141</sup>Ce with a half-life of 32.5&nbsp;days. All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, and most of them have half-lives under ten minutes.{{NUBASE2016|ref}} The isotopes between <sup>140</sup>Ce and <sup>144</sup>Ce inclusive occur as [[fission product]]s of [[uranium]].{{NUBASE2016|ref}} The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than <sup>140</sup>Ce is [[beta plus decay|inverse beta decay]] or [[electron capture]] to [[isotopes of lanthanum]], while that of the heavier isotopes is [[beta decay]] to [[isotopes of praseodymium]].{{NUBASE2016|ref}}\n\nThe rarity of the proton-rich <sup>136</sup>Ce and <sup>138</sup>Ce is explained by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] for elements beyond iron, the [[s-process]] (slow neutron capture) and the [[r-process]] (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called [[p-nuclei]], and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include [[proton capture]] as well as [[photodisintegration]].<ref name=\"Cameron\">{{cite journal | last1 = Cameron |first1 = A.

Cerium is a [[hardness|soft]], [[ductile]] and silvery-white [[metal]] that tarnishes when exposed to air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the [[lanthanide]] series, and while it often shows the +3 [[oxidation state]] characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also considered one of the [[rare-earth element]]s. Cerium has no biological role in humans and is not very toxic.\n\nDespite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the [[monazite]] and [[bastn\u00e4site]] groups, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by [[neodymium]], [[lanthanum]], and [[praseodymium]]. It is the 26th-most [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundant element]], making up 66&nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] of the Earth's crust, half as much as [[chlorine]] and five times as much as [[lead]].\n\nCerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered, in [[Bastn\u00e4s]], Sweden, by [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] and [[Wilhelm Hisinger]] in 1803, and independently by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in Germany in the same year. In 1839 [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] became the first to isolate the metal. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, [[cerium(IV) oxide]] is used to polish glass and is an important part of [[catalytic converter]]s. Cerium metal is used in [[ferrocerium]] lighters for its [[pyrophoric]] properties. Cerium-doped [[YAG]] phosphor is used in conjunction with blue [[light-emitting diode]]s to produce white light in most commercial white LED light sources.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n=== Physical ===\nCerium is the second element of the [[lanthanide]] series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides [[lanthanum]] to its left and [[praseodymium]] to its right, and above the [[actinide]] [[thorium]].

The energy of the 4f electron is nearly the same as that of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures.

Additionally, <sup>140</sup>Ce would release energy upon [[spontaneous fission]]. None of these decay modes have yet been observed, though the double beta decay of <sup>136</sup>Ce, <sup>138</sup>Ce, and <sup>142</sup>Ce have been experimentally searched for.

This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides.

Ceria, as isolated in 1803, contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from Bastn\u00e4s, Sweden, and thus only contained about 45% of what is now known to be pure ceria. It was not until [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] succeeded in removing lanthana and [[Didymium|\"didymia\"]] in the late 1830s that ceria was obtained pure. Wilhelm Hisinger was a wealthy mine-owner and amateur scientist, and sponsor of Berzelius.

The [[Munda languages]] belong to the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic family]].{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=354}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*Krishnamurti, B., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=54fV7Lwu3fMC&pg=PA492&dq=Proto+south+dravidian&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XFnFU-LaKdacugTosIGACQ&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Proto%20south%20dravidian&f=false The Dravidian Languages]'', Cambridge University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-521-77111-0}} \n*Subrahmanyam, P.S.,  ''Dravidian Comparative Phonology'', Annamalai University, 1983.\n*Zvelebil, Kamil., ''Dravidian Linguistics: An Introduction\", PILC (Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture), 1990\n* {{cite book |first=Jane R. |last=McIntosh |title=The Ancient Indus Valley : New Perspectives |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=9781576079072 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |first=Mikhail Sergeevich |last=Andronov |title=A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhB60gYvnLgC&pg=PA299 |year=2003 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-04455-4 |ref=harv }}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elamo-Dravidian]]\n*[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]\n*[[Sanskrit]]\n\n==External links==\n{{cite book |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/index.html |title=Dravidian Etymological Dictionary, 2nd Edition |accessdate=2008-10-26 |author=T.

On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers. \n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronny remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronny and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it. \n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter. \n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronny meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD, and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist. \n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronny leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies. \n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realises that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence. \n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie\u2019s illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship. \n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn\u2019t his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and seeing a reflection of the dead Neha sitting behind them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tiger Shroff]] as Captain Ranveer Pratap Singh (Ronnie) (Neha's former boyfriend and Rhea's father)\n* [[Disha Patani]] as Neha Salgaonkar n\u00e9e Rawat (Ronnie's former girlfriend, Rhea's mother and Shekhar's wife)<ref name=HT2122018>{{cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/baaghi-2-trailer-tiger-shroff-our-desi-rambo-returns-there-is-an-army-of-villains-to-keep-him-busy/story-5hzeQNEoVuFBIYNzBRUIaM.html|title=Baaghi 2 trailer: Aditya, our desi Rambo, returns.

On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers. \n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronny remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronny and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it. \n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter. \n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronny meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD, and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist. \n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronny leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies. \n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realises that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence. \n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie\u2019s illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship. \n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn\u2019t his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and seeing a reflection of the dead Neha sitting behind them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tiger Shroff]] as Captain Ranveer Pratap Singh (Ronnie) (Neha's former boyfriend and Rhea's father)\n* [[Disha Patani]] as Neha Salgaonkar n\u00e9e Rawat (Ronnie's former girlfriend, Rhea's mother and Shekhar's wife)<ref name=HT2122018>{{cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/baaghi-2-trailer-tiger-shroff-our-desi-rambo-returns-there-is-an-army-of-villains-to-keep-him-busy/story-5hzeQNEoVuFBIYNzBRUIaM.html|title=Baaghi 2 trailer: Aditya, our desi Rambo, returns.
