{"title_page": "Midrasha", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}\nA '''''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4}}, pl. ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study|Jewish studies]] for women. In [[Israel]], it is often an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. The term is often translated as '[[seminary]]'.{{fact|date=October 2014}} \n\nIn [[Israel]], a midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' (institute). Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}''  accept both men and women, such as the Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Eni Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term has also been used to refer to co-educational Jewish studies programs, allowing high school students to continue their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Ethics (Musar)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']]. See [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \nNote that, depending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''; \nsee [[Women in Judaism #Views on the education of women]] and [[Orthodox Judaism #Diversity]].\n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] aligned ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of ''Tanakh'' and Jewish philosophy at these will typically be text-focused, built around ''[[chavruta]]''-based study as at yeshivot.\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's {{lang|he-Latn|[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]}}, if less intensely\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]).\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied ''practically'', i.e. as opposed to following the complete derivation from Talmudic sources [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|as at a men's Yeshiva]]\n(although see [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] where the treatment is Talmud-based).\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned ''midrashot'' - often referred to as \"seminaries\" - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]], see for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]].\nThese are typically more conservative in their approach:\nselections from the Talmud may be studied, but only in the context of other classes - particular philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills, with content delivered primarily via lecture\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]]).\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hassidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \n\nIn the Religious Zionist community women often continue their studies at one of the midrasha-affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a Torah-program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree; \nspecializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or Jewish philosophy.\nOther institutions such as [[Machon Tal]], associated with the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offer degrees in engineering or management. [[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study|Jewish studies]] for women. In [[Israel]], it is often an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. The term is often translated as '[[seminary]]'.{{fact|date=October 2014}} \n\nIn [[Israel]], a midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' (institute). Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}''  accept both men and women, such as the Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Eni Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term has also been used to refer to co-educational Jewish studies programs, allowing high school students to continue their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Ethics (Musar)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']]. See [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \nNote that, depending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''; \nsee [[Women in Judaism #Views on the education of women]] and [[Orthodox Judaism #Diversity]].\n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] aligned ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of ''Tanakh'' and Jewish philosophy at these will typically be text-focused, built around ''[[chavruta]]''-based study as at yeshivot.\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's {{lang|he-Latn|[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]}}, if less intensely\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]).\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied ''practically'', i.e. as opposed to following the complete derivation from Talmudic sources [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|as at a men's Yeshiva]]\n(although see [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] where the treatment is Talmud-based).\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned ''midrashot'' - often referred to as \"seminaries\" - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]], see for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]].\nThese are typically more conservative in their approach:\nselections from the Talmud may be studied, but only in the context of other classes - particular philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills, with content delivered primarily via lecture\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]]).\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hassidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \n\nIn the Religious Zionist community women often continue their studies at one of the midrasha-affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a Torah-program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree; \nspecializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or Jewish philosophy.\nOther institutions such as [[Machon Tal]], associated with the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offer degrees in engineering or management. [[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

Their mission, as stated by the Western Council, is to defeat the evil Uukrul, a dark magician of incredible power, who ages ago overthrew the Ancients of the city, and claimed all of its passages and caverns as his dominion. Now Eriosth\u00e9 is plagued by monsters and the minions of Uukrul. Fearing Uukrul will attack the western lands, 18 months back the Council sent a party lead by one Mara, but without news a new party must be assembled.\n\nHowever, there's a way to achieve this seemingly impossible task. To reach the greatest possible powers, Uukrul detached his soul from his body, and stored his heart of dark stone somewhere within the furthest reaches of the maze-like passages of Eriosth\u00e9. Access to the heart is in turn opened by several other hearts, which must be found behind battles with fierce enemies, hidden at secret places, or guarded by inscrutable riddles.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe four adventurers are each of a different class: a fighter, a magician, a priest and a paladin. Each one has unique characteristics. The fighter and paladin are capable of wearing and using the heaviest gear and weapons, and dealing the highest physical damage. The paladin can also lay hands over a foe to do damage, or over a friend or the whole party to heal. The magician uses wits to deliver spells from five disciplines for different effects: damaging, healing, discovering secret doors, translating unknown texts, etc. Finally, the priest send prayers to four different gods, and each prayer should have a certain effect, some similar to the magician's spells, and others unique to the priest. But the gods are whimsical or can be angered, so often prayers aren't answered, and sometimes the god smites back the priest for disturbing their godly rest.\n\nAt the game's start, certain characteristics of each party member are decided through a series of questions which can, for example, create an agile warrior capable of dodging enemy's attacks at the cost of lesser damage dealt, or a bulky warrior not so able to evade or parry attacks but dealing much more damage in each successful hit.\n\nThe exploration system is in first-person perspective, with a simple 3D effect. One important feature of the game is its auto-map: when viewing the map, squares already explored are marked as such. Therefore, there is no need to use a paper and pencil to draw the map, although in certain areas there's a fog preventing viewing the map at all. The city itself is divided in zones, and to move from one zone to the next, the party must pass through sanctuaries. The sanctuaries are the only place where the game can be saved, and has also a cache to save items, the party can rest and recover health points, etc. The first time the party enters any given sanctuary, all wounds and illnesses are cured. Visiting a sanctuary when a character has enough experience points also makes that character advance a level up to the maximum level of 15.\n\nEntering the sanctuary requires using one of four soul amulets which came printed with the game. These copy-protection printouts are used to decode the secret word to open the door to the sanctuary. Many runes and scriptures found in the walls of the city are also written with the same glyphs. Entering a sanctuary only requires the secret word the first time, afterwards it can be entered freely. Sanctuaries also have teleports to other sanctuaries and special places.\n\nThe zone past the sanctuary Urlasar has most of the remaining inhabited Eriosth\u00e9, such as shops, the temple, the mausoleum, the guild, the shrines and somewhat deeper the circle of magicians. One thing to take care of is that the party needs supplies to keep exploring. If food depletes, the party will start to lose health points and even die eventually. At the shrines and the circle of magicians, the priest and magician can acquire new rings if their level is high enough, in the case of the priest to have more chances to pray successfully, and in the case of the magician to access higher level spells. In case a party member dies, the body can be brought to the temple and resurrection can be attempted. In case it fails, a new member for the party can be found and chosen between several candidates at the guild.\n\nDuring the exploration, packs of monsters can attack randomly, mostly in open areas. Certain places trigger the attack of specific foes too, and the deeper in Eriosth\u00e9 the party goes, the harder the monsters are. The battles themselves are turn based, first with a movement phase and then with an attack phase. Everything is done on an overhead view, where small square icons represent the party members and the foes. Besides moving and attacking, the priest can pray, the magician can launch spells, and other actions like retreat can be triggered.\n\nExploring the caverns and mazes requires more than just good gear. There are clues about where to find hidden doors, the key to advancing the story, but some doors are impenetrable to magic or prayers, and riddles and puzzles must be solved to open them - mechanically or through a secret word.\n\n==Production==\nThe game was created by Ian Boswell and Martin Buis while they were studying as a pet project over the course of several years. Once Broderbund agreed to publish the game, they needed another year to complete it, all on a very limited budget.\n\nThe game was noted for its primitive graphics even for 1989 {{According to whom|date=May 2017}}. On DOS, it supported CGA, EGA and VGA graphics.\n\nThe game has neither music nor sound in both Apple II and DOS platforms.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Dark Heart of Uukrul'' was unsuccessful, selling fewer than 5,000 copies despite good reviews.
