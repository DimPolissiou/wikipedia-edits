None is in active military service with U.S  forces. The B-26 was built at two locations : Baltimore, MD; and Omaha,  NE, by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. The Baltimore plant was located at [[Middle River, Maryland]] (just east of [[Baltimore]]) from 1941 to 1945. The western location was part of the expansion of government owned, inland plants.\n\nFirst used in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]] in early 1942, it was also used in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]] and in [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Europe]].\n\nAfter entering service with the [[United States Army]] aviation units, the [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] quickly received the reputation of a \"[[:en:wikt:widow-maker|widowmaker]]\" due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was due to the fact that the Marauder had to be flown at precise [[airspeed]]s, particularly on final runway approach or when one engine was out. The unusually high 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to many pilots who were used to much slower approach speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below those stipulated in the manual, the aircraft would often stall and crash.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 242\">Ethell 1995, p. 242.</ref>\n\nThe B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were re-trained, and after [[aerodynamics]] modifications (an increase of wingspan and wing [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle-of-incidence]] to give better takeoff performance, and a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder).<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, pp. 242-243\">Ethell 1995, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref> The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate  of any USAAF bomber.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 243\">Ethell 1995, p. 243.</ref>\n\nA total of 5,288 were produced between February 1941 and March 1945; 522 of these were flown by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[South African Air Force]]. By the time the [[United States Air Force]] was created as an independent military service separate from the [[United States Army]] in 1947, all Martin B-26s had been retired from U.S. service. After the Marauder was retired the unrelated [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] then assumed the \"B-26\" designation which led to confusion between the two aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn March 1939, the [[United States Army Air Corps]] issued Circular Proposal 39-640, a specification for a twin-engined medium bomber with a maximum speed of {{convert|350|mph|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} and a bomb load of {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}. On 5 July 1939, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] submitted its design, produced by a team led by [[Peyton M. Magruder]], to meet the requirement, the Martin Model 179. Martin's design was evaluated as superior to the other proposals and was awarded a contract for 201 aircraft, to be designated B-26.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 23.</ref> The B-26 went from paper concept to an operational bomber in approximately two years.<ref name=\"Trent p. 647\">Trent 2008, p. 647.</ref> Additional orders for a further 930 B-26s followed in September 1940, still prior to the first flight of the type.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 25.</ref>\n\n[[File:Closeup view of Martin B-26C in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup view of a Martin B-26B Marauder in flight]]\nThe B-26 was a shoulder-winged [[monoplane]] of all-metal construction, fitted with a [[tricycle landing gear]]. It had a streamlined, circular section [[fuselage]] housing the crew, consisting of a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the nose, armed with a {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]], a pilot and co-pilot sitting side by side, with positions for the radio operator and navigator behind the pilots. A gunner manned a dorsal turret armed with two {{convert|.50|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns (the first powered dorsal turret to be fitted to a U.S. bomber), and an additional {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine gun was fitted in the tail.{{refn|Rare photos on pp. 61\u201362 show the original tail gun position for the B-26 Marauder 1A with the single .30 caliber replaced with a single .50 caliber, and tail gun position of the B-26B which was upgraded from one .50 caliber to two .50 caliber machine guns.<ref name=\"Hot\"/> |group=Note}}\n\nTwo [[bomb bay]]s were fitted mid-fuselage, capable of carrying {{convert|5800|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of bombs, although in practice such a bomb load reduced range too much, and the aft bomb bay was usually fitted with additional fuel tanks instead of bombs. The aircraft was powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp]] [[radial engine]]s in nacelles slung under the wing, driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were manufactured at the [[Ford Dearborn Engine plant]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], USA. The wings were of low [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] and relatively small in area for an aircraft of its weight, giving the required high performance, but also resulting in a [[wing loading]] of {{cvt|53|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} for the initial versions, which at the time was the highest of any aircraft accepted for service by the Army Air Corps, until the introduction of the  [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], with the then-astonishing wing loading of {{cvt|69.12|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} (although both would be considered lightly loaded by the standard of combat aircraft of the next decade).<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23-5\">''Air International'' January 1988, pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nThe first B-26, with Martin test pilot William K. \"Ken\" Ebel at the controls, flew on 25 November 1940 and was effectively the prototype. Deliveries to the U.S. Army Air Corps began in February 1941 with the second aircraft, ''40-1362''.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\"/> In March 1941, the Army Air Corps started Accelerated Service Testing of the B-26 at [[Wright-Patterson AFB|Patterson Field]], near [[Dayton, Ohio]].\n\n===Accidents===\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\nThe B-26's relatively small wing area and resulting high [[wing loading]] required a high landing speed of {{convert|120|to|135|mph|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] depending on load. At least two of the earliest B-26s suffered hard landings and damage to the main landing gear, engine mounts, propellers and fuselage. The type was grounded briefly in April 1941<ref>Mendenhall; lack of entries on Forms 5A</ref> to investigate the landing difficulties. Two causes were found: insufficient landing speed (producing a [[stall (flight)|stall]]) and improper weight distribution. The latter was due to the lack of a dorsal turret; the Martin power turret was not yet ready.\n\nSome of the very earliest B-26s suffered collapses of the nose landing gear. It is said that they were caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941.\n\nThe Pratt & Whitney [[R-2800-5]] engines were reliable, but the Curtiss electric [[Propeller governor|pitch change mechanism]] in the propellers required impeccable maintenance, not always attainable in the field. [[Human error]] and some failures of the mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a \"runaway prop\". Due to its sound and the possibility that the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the [[22nd Bombardment Group]], Colonel Mark Lewis.\n\nThe Martin B-26 suffered only two fatal accidents during its first year of flight, from November 1940 to November 1941: a crash shortly after takeoff near Martin's [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]] plant in [[Maryland]] (cause unknown, but engine malfunction strongly suggested) and the loss of a [[38th Bombardment Group]] B-26 when its vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the aircraft at altitude (cause unknown, but the accident report discussed the possibility that a canopy hatch broke off and struck the vertical stabilizer).\n\nAs pilots were trained quickly for the war, relatively inexperienced pilots entered the cockpit and the accident rate increased. This occurred at the same time as more experienced B-26 pilots of the 22nd, 38th and [[42nd Bombardment Group]]s were proving the merits of the bomber.\n\nFor a time in 1942, pilots in training believed that the B-26 could not be flown on one engine. This was disproved by several experienced pilots, including Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who flew demonstration flights at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Army Air Field]], which featured take offs and landings with only one engine. Also, seventeen [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] were trained to demonstrate the B-26, in an attempt to \"shame\" male pilots into the air.<ref>[https://www.worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii0015 WASPs Receive Final Instructions Before Flying Martin B-26 Marauder]</ref>\n\nIn 1942, aviation pioneer and company founder [[Glenn L. Martin]] was called before the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, (or also known as the \"[[Truman Committee]]\"), which was investigating defense contracting abuses. Senator [[Harry S Truman]] of [[Missouri]], the committee chairman (and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and 33rd [[President of the United States]] in 1945-1952), asked Martin why the B-26 had problems. Martin responded that the wings were too short. Senator Truman curtly asked why the wings had not been changed. When Martin replied that the plans were too close to completion, and his company already had the contract, Truman's testy response was quick and to the point: In that case, the contract would be canceled. Martin corrected the wings.<ref>McCullough 2003, p. 319.</ref> (By February 1943, the newest model aircraft, the B-26B-10, had an additional {{convert|6|ft|m}} of wingspan, plus uprated engines, more armor and larger guns.)<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:uNu9nEjaJVEJ:www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/pdf/B26_spec.pdf+%22B-26+B%22+%226+feet%22+wing&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShJ8tOuOvd1pcVqdXRF6iguphAruZ8OJbXvwKxPPUHAt9aKzeJ8uYApDG4ExYpgZRow5RAljNb6YE_3BPPdGIgjP5xJEDOVd8RWREDPqlNIAZanXhNL7QxK6lMJpMR-kiV-M-tO&sig=AHIEtbS9G--srwDYxQY0W20gly_Xe-kOyw&pli=1 \"Martin Aircraft Specifications: B-26 Marauder Types.\"] ''The Glenn L.

This instability is similar to \"[[Dutch roll]]\". This would make for a very uncomfortable ride, especially for the tail gunner.\n\nThe B-26 is stated by the [[9th Air Force]] to have had the lowest combat loss rate of any US aircraft used during the war. Nevertheless, it remained a challenging aircraft to fly and continued to be unpopular with some pilots throughout its military career. In 1944, in answer to many pilots complaining to the press and their relatives back home, the USAAF and Martin took the unusual step during war, of commissioning large articles to be placed in various popular publications, \"educating\" and defending the so-called flying/accident record of the B-26 against \"slanders\". One of the largest of these articles was in the May 1944 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''.<ref name=\"Hot\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hd8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=popular+Mechanics+1944+Marader&hl=en&ei=tq2iTI7hEouenQflj92IBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"They Said It Was Too 'Hot' To Fly.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1944.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Martin Marauder ExCC.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Air Force B-26 flying over [[Banja Luka]] during World War II]]\n\nThe B-26 Marauder was used mostly in Europe, but also saw action in the Mediterranean and the Pacific.

There, the 38th continued the testing of the B-26, including its range and fuel efficiency. Immediately after the entry of the United States into World War II, plans were tentatively developed to send the 38th BG to the South West Pacific and to equip it with B-26Bs fitted with more auxiliary fuel tanks and provisions for carrying [[aerial torpedo]]es.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p75\"/> Three 38th BG B-26Bs<ref>Letters from Maj.

Two were shot down and the other two were so badly damaged that they were written off after the mission. Their torpedoes failed to hit any Japanese ships, although they did shoot down one [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter and killed two seamen aboard the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] with machine-gun fire.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p75\"/><ref name=\"Shattered p151-3\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 151\u2013153.</ref> Notably, one of them, ''Susie Q'', after dropping its single torpedo and searching for a safer escape route, flew directly down the length of the ''Akagi'' while being chased by interceptors and anti-aircraft fire, which had to hold their fire to avoid hitting their own flagship.

In 1943, it was decided that the B-26 would be phased out of operations in the South West Pacific Theater in favor of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell]]. Nevertheless, the 19th Bombardment Squadron of the 22nd BG continued to fly missions in the B-26.

They were initially used to carry out low-level attacks against heavily defended targets, incurring heavy losses with poor results, before switching to medium level attacks. By the end of the [[North African Campaign]], the three B-26 groups had flown 1,587 sorties, losing 80 aircraft. This was double the loss rate of the B-25, which also flew 70% more sorties with fewer aircraft.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p76-7\">''Air International'' February 1988, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> Despite this, the B-26 continued in service with the [[Twelfth Air Force]], supporting the Allied advance through [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and [[Operation Dragoon|southern France]].<ref name=\"Donald p177\">Donald 1995, p. 177.</ref><ref name=\"Swan army p338\">Swanborough and Bowers 1963, p. 338.</ref> [[John Slessor|Air Marshal Sir John Slessor]], Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, wrote of \"the astonishing accuracy of the experienced medium bomber groups \u2013 particularly the Marauders; I think that the 42nd Bombardment Group in Sardinia is probably the best day-bomber unit in the world.\"<ref name=\"Slessor p572\">Slessor 1957, p. 572.</ref> Slessor in fact meant the 42nd Bomb Wing\u201417th, 319th and 320th Bomb Groups\u2014but a US 'wing' equated roughly to a British 'group', and vice versa.\n\n===Northwest Europe===\n[[File:B-26B Flak Damage.jpg|thumb|right|Martin B-26B-1-MA Marauder, AAF Ser.

None is in active military service with U.S  forces. The B-26 was built at two locations : Baltimore, MD; and Omaha,  NE, by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. The Baltimore plant was located at [[Middle River, Maryland]] (just east of [[Baltimore]]) from 1941 to 1945. The western location was part of the expansion of government owned, inland plants.\n\nFirst used in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]] in early 1942, it was also used in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]] and in [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Europe]].\n\nAfter entering service with the [[United States Army]] aviation units, the [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] quickly received the reputation of a \"[[:en:wikt:widow-maker|widowmaker]]\" due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was due to the fact that the Marauder had to be flown at precise [[airspeed]]s, particularly on final runway approach or when one engine was out. The unusually high 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to many pilots who were used to much slower approach speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below what the manual stipulated, the aircraft would often stall and crash.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 242\">Ethell 1995, p. 242.</ref>\n\nThe B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were re-trained, and after [[aerodynamics]] modifications (an increase of wingspan and wing [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle-of-incidence]] to give better takeoff performance, and a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder).<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, pp. 242-243\">Ethell 1995, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref> The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate  of any USAAF bomber.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 243\">Ethell 1995, p. 243.</ref>\n\nA total of 5,288 were produced between February 1941 and March 1945; 522 of these were flown by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[South African Air Force]]. By the time the [[United States Air Force]] was created as an independent military service separate from the [[United States Army]] in 1947, all Martin B-26s had been retired from U.S. service. After the Marauder was retired the unrelated [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] then assumed the \"B-26\" designation which led to confusion between the two aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn March 1939, the [[United States Army Air Corps]] issued Circular Proposal 39-640, a specification for a twin-engined medium bomber with a maximum speed of {{convert|350|mph|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} and a bomb load of {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}. On 5 July 1939, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] submitted its design, produced by a team led by [[Peyton M. Magruder]], to meet the requirement, the Martin Model 179. Martin's design was evaluated as superior to the other proposals and was awarded a contract for 201 aircraft, to be designated B-26.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 23.</ref> The B-26 went from paper concept to an operational bomber in approximately two years.<ref name=\"Trent p. 647\">Trent 2008, p. 647.</ref> Additional orders for a further 930 B-26s followed in September 1940, still prior to the first flight of the type.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 25.</ref>\n\n[[File:Closeup view of Martin B-26C in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup view of a Martin B-26B Marauder in flight]]\nThe B-26 was a shoulder-winged [[monoplane]] of all-metal construction, fitted with a [[tricycle landing gear]]. It had a streamlined, circular section [[fuselage]] housing the crew, consisting of a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the nose, armed with a {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]], a pilot and co-pilot sitting side by side, with positions for the radio operator and navigator behind the pilots. A gunner manned a dorsal turret armed with two {{convert|.50|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns (the first powered dorsal turret to be fitted to a U.S. bomber), and an additional {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine gun was fitted in the tail.{{refn|Rare photos on pp. 61\u201362 show the original tail gun position for the B-26 Marauder 1A with the single .30 caliber replaced with a single .50 caliber, and tail gun position of the B-26B which was upgraded from one .50 caliber to two .50 caliber machine guns.<ref name=\"Hot\"/> |group=Note}}\n\nTwo [[bomb bay]]s were fitted mid-fuselage, capable of carrying {{convert|5800|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of bombs, although in practice such a bomb load reduced range too much, and the aft bomb bay was usually fitted with additional fuel tanks instead of bombs. The aircraft was powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp]] [[radial engine]]s in nacelles slung under the wing, driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were manufactured at the [[Ford Dearborn Engine plant]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], USA. The wings were of low [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] and relatively small in area for an aircraft of its weight, giving the required high performance, but also resulting in a [[wing loading]] of {{cvt|53|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} for the initial versions, which at the time was the highest of any aircraft accepted for service by the Army Air Corps, until the introduction of the  [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], with the then-astonishing wing loading of {{cvt|69.12|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} (although both would be considered lightly loaded by the standard of combat aircraft of the next decade).<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23-5\">''Air International'' January 1988, pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nThe first B-26, with Martin test pilot William K. \"Ken\" Ebel at the controls, flew on 25 November 1940 and was effectively the prototype. Deliveries to the U.S. Army Air Corps began in February 1941 with the second aircraft, ''40-1362''.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\"/> In March 1941, the Army Air Corps started Accelerated Service Testing of the B-26 at [[Wright-Patterson AFB|Patterson Field]], near [[Dayton, Ohio]].\n\n===Accidents===\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\nThe B-26's relatively small wing area and resulting high [[wing loading]] required a high landing speed of {{convert|120|to|135|mph|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] depending on load. At least two of the earliest B-26s suffered hard landings and damage to the main landing gear, engine mounts, propellers and fuselage. The type was grounded briefly in April 1941<ref>Mendenhall; lack of entries on Forms 5A</ref> to investigate the landing difficulties. Two causes were found: insufficient landing speed (producing a [[stall (flight)|stall]]) and improper weight distribution. The latter was due to the lack of a dorsal turret; the Martin power turret was not yet ready.\n\nSome of the very earliest B-26s suffered collapses of the nose landing gear. It is said that they were caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941.\n\nThe Pratt & Whitney [[R-2800-5]] engines were reliable, but the Curtiss electric [[Propeller governor|pitch change mechanism]] in the propellers required impeccable maintenance, not always attainable in the field. [[Human error]] and some failures of the mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a \"runaway prop\". Due to its sound and the possibility that the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the [[22nd Bombardment Group]], Colonel Mark Lewis.\n\nThe Martin B-26 suffered only two fatal accidents during its first year of flight, from November 1940 to November 1941: a crash shortly after takeoff near Martin's [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]] plant in [[Maryland]] (cause unknown, but engine malfunction strongly suggested) and the loss of a [[38th Bombardment Group]] B-26 when its vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the aircraft at altitude (cause unknown, but the accident report discussed the possibility that a canopy hatch broke off and struck the vertical stabilizer).\n\nAs pilots were trained quickly for the war, relatively inexperienced pilots entered the cockpit and the accident rate increased. This occurred at the same time as more experienced B-26 pilots of the 22nd, 38th and [[42nd Bombardment Group]]s were proving the merits of the bomber.\n\nFor a time in 1942, pilots in training believed that the B-26 could not be flown on one engine. This was disproved by several experienced pilots, including Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who flew demonstration flights at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Army Air Field]], which featured take offs and landings with only one engine. Also, seventeen [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] were trained to demonstrate the B-26, in an attempt to \"shame\" male pilots into the air.<ref>[https://www.worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii0015 WASPs Receive Final Instructions Before Flying Martin B-26 Marauder]</ref>\n\nIn 1942, aviation pioneer and company founder [[Glenn L. Martin]] was called before the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, (or also known as the \"[[Truman Committee]]\"), which was investigating defense contracting abuses. Senator [[Harry S Truman]] of [[Missouri]], the committee chairman (and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and 33rd [[President of the United States]] in 1945-1952), asked Martin why the B-26 had problems. Martin responded that the wings were too short. Senator Truman curtly asked why the wings had not been changed. When Martin replied that the plans were too close to completion, and his company already had the contract, Truman's testy response was quick and to the point: In that case, the contract would be canceled. Martin corrected the wings.<ref>McCullough 2003, p. 319.</ref> (By February 1943, the newest model aircraft, the B-26B-10, had an additional {{convert|6|ft|m}} of wingspan, plus uprated engines, more armor and larger guns.)<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:uNu9nEjaJVEJ:www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/pdf/B26_spec.pdf+%22B-26+B%22+%226+feet%22+wing&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShJ8tOuOvd1pcVqdXRF6iguphAruZ8OJbXvwKxPPUHAt9aKzeJ8uYApDG4ExYpgZRow5RAljNb6YE_3BPPdGIgjP5xJEDOVd8RWREDPqlNIAZanXhNL7QxK6lMJpMR-kiV-M-tO&sig=AHIEtbS9G--srwDYxQY0W20gly_Xe-kOyw&pli=1 \"Martin Aircraft Specifications: B-26 Marauder Types.\"] ''The Glenn L.

In 1944, in answer to many pilots complaining to the press and their relatives back home, the USAAF and Martin took the unusual step during war, of commissioning large articles to be placed in various popular publications, \"educating\" and defending the so-called flying/accident record of the B-26 against \"slanders\".

A widow since 1998, she lives with actor [[John Corbett]]. Now in semi-retirement, she makes occasional film, television, and documentary appearances.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nDerek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father, Paul Collins, was a [[Hobie Cat]] executive, and her mother, Norma (n\u00e9e White), was a make-up artist and hairdresser to [[Ann-Margret]]. Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S. Patton Continuation School, both in [[Harbor City, California]]. She remarked in a 1985 interview on ''Late Night with David Letterman'':\n\n{{quote|quote=I was 16 when I quit high school.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios. The film remained unreleased until 1981, at which time it received negative notices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Bo Derek In 'Fantasies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/movies/young-bo-derek-in-fantasies.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-11-07|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nCollins and John Derek married on June 10, 1976; she was 19 and he 49.

This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied.

Several scenes of Derek wearing revealing outfits were featured, along with nude scenes of Derek being bathed and body-painted. Prior to the film's release MGM and the film's distributor, [[United Artists]], were sued by the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] estate over the name of the film, as Derek's role and body overshadowed the story of Tarzan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bo Derek Takes To The Jungle To Bring 'Tarzan' Back Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/movies/bo-derek-takes-to-the-jungle-to-bring-tarzan-back-alive.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-07-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> Although the film received negative reviews from many critics, ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' became a box-office success, making over $35 million in ticket sales and becoming the [[1981 in film|15th highest-grossing film of 1981]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|title=1981 Yearly Box Office Results \u2013 Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> For her performance, Derek shared the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] with [[Faye Dunaway]], the latter for her starring role as [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]''.\n\nDerek starred in ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984). Again directed by John Derek, the film explored the female protagonist's sexual awakening, and her journey around the world to find an ideal first lover to take her virginity. Its sexual nature, along with its substantial use of nudity, resulted in the film receiving an [[X rating]], usually reserved for [[pornographic]] or extremely violent horror films.

A widow since 1998, she lives with actor [[John Corbett]]. Now in semi-retirement, she makes occasional film, television, and documentary appearances.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nDerek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father, Paul Collins, was a [[Hobie Cat]] executive, and her mother, Norma (n\u00e9e White), was a make-up artist and hairdresser to [[Ann-Margret]]. Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S. Patton Continuation School, both in [[Harbor City, California]]. She remarked in a 1985 interview on ''Late Night with David Letterman'':\n\n{{quote|quote=I was 16 when I quit high school.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios. The film remained unreleased until 1981, at which time it received negative notices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Bo Derek In 'Fantasies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/movies/young-bo-derek-in-fantasies.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-11-07|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nCollins and John Derek married on June 10, 1976; she was 19 and he 49.

Derek's appearance in a dream sequence, racing towards Moore in a flimsy flesh-colored swimsuit, launched her status as a mainstream sex symbol. This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied. ''10'' was a critical and financial success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1979 Movies at the Domestic Box Office|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1979|publisher=Nash Information Services LLC|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''10,'' Derek was cast in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' (1980), a dramatic-comedy film that featured [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]].

Directed by her husband, the film dealt little with [[Tarzan]] and instead focused on Derek's character of [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Parker]], and specifically on Derek's physical attributes. Several scenes of Derek wearing revealing outfits were featured, along with nude scenes of Derek being bathed and body-painted. Prior to the film's release MGM and the film's distributor, [[United Artists]], were sued by the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] estate over the name of the film, as Derek's role and body overshadowed the story of Tarzan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bo Derek Takes To The Jungle To Bring 'Tarzan' Back Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/movies/bo-derek-takes-to-the-jungle-to-bring-tarzan-back-alive.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-07-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> Although the film received negative reviews from many critics, ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' became a box-office success, making over $35 million in ticket sales and becoming the [[1981 in film|15th highest-grossing film of 1981]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|title=1981 Yearly Box Office Results \u2013 Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> For her performance, Derek shared the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] with [[Faye Dunaway]], the latter for her starring role as [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]''.\n\nDerek starred in ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984). Again directed by John Derek, the film explored the female protagonist's sexual awakening, and her journey around the world to find an ideal first lover to take her virginity. Its sexual nature, along with its substantial use of nudity, resulted in the film receiving an [[X rating]], usually reserved for [[pornographic]] or extremely violent horror films.

The final collaboration of Derek with her husband as director, ''Ghosts Can't Do It'' was a failure both critically (a \"cinematic abomination\")<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghosts Can't Do It|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ghosts-cant-do-it-v19688|publisher=Allmovie|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> and financially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Movie Sucks|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/your-movie-sucks/|publisher=ultimatemovierankings.com|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> For her performance in ''Ghosts Can't Do It'', during which she delivered such lines as \"You have my heart...how can I live without my heart,\" Derek won her third [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]].

The offender must be at least 25 years of age, have served sentences for at least two [[Indictment|indictable]] offenses, and the sentencing judge must decide that [[preventive detention]] is required to protect the public.<ref name=\"johnhoward\">http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/PUB/C20.htm#aus  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722101411/http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/PUB/C20.htm#aus |date=July 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n====Tasmania====\nAn offender who is at least 17 years of age and has been convicted of at least two violent or sexual offences can be declared a dangerous offender and detained indeterminately. A judge must consider the potential of future harm that could be caused by  offenders, the circumstances of their offenses, medical and psychiatric opinion and any other matters of relevance. The decision passed by the court is not reviewable; the indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed and release is by way of an order from the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"johnhoward\" />\n\n====Western Australia====\nThe ''Criminal Code Act 1913'' (WA) and the ''Crimes (Serious and Repeat Offenders) Act 1992 ''(WA) contain provisions for the indeterminate incarceration of youths and adults convicted of particular offenses. The indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and release is through a Supreme Court Order or at the discretion of the Governor.<ref name=\"johnhoward\" />\n\n====The Northern Territory and South Australia====\nThe ''Criminal Code Act 1983'' (NT) and the ''Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988'' (SA) allow for the indeterminate incarceration of a person who is determined to be a habitual criminal and/or incapable of controlling their sexual urges.\n\nIn South Australia, the indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and are reviewed every three years after that. Release is only by way of an order from the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"johnhoward\" />\n\nIn the Northern Territory, a prisoner serving indefinite sentence(s) has a nominal sentence set at half the sentence that would have been imposed if not they were not dangerous, or 20 years (25 years in some circumstances) if the sentence imposed would have been one or more consecutive sentences of life imprisonment. The indeterminate sentence(s) must be reviewed by the court when the nominal sentence (the minimum term the offender would have been required to serve if they were ''not'' dangerous) has expired, and every three years after.\n\n====The Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, and Victoria====\nThe ''Sentencing Act 2005'' (ACT), the ''Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003'' (Qld), and the ''Sentencing Act 1991'' (Vic) govern habitual offenders. An offender can be incarcerated indeterminately if there is a high probability, given the offender's character, the nature of their offense, psychiatric evidence as to the dangerousness of the defendant, and any other relevant circumstances, that the offender poses a serious threat to the community. The indeterminate sentence(s) must be reviewed by the court when the nominal sentence (the minimum term the offender would have been required to serve if they were ''not'' dangerous) has expired, and every three years after.\n\nThe minimum nominal sentence that can be imposed is ten years, but the sentencing judge can extend this if they believe that the prisoner's criminal history and/or the nature of the prisoner's offending warrants it.\n\nThe longest nominal sentence on sentence(s) of indeterminate imprisonment is 30 years, currently being served by serial pedophile Geoffrey Robert Dobbs (Queensland), who pleaded guilty to 124 sex offences and one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice committed against 63 girls aged between one month and 15 years (including five family members) under his care as a teacher and youth leader from 1972 to 2000.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], the Habitual Offender Act in Canada dealt with multiple offenders. The law was repealed after a Law Commission Report of 1969 found it to be erratically applied and was often used against non-violent and non-dangerous offenders. In 1977, Part XXIV of the Criminal Code was enacted for habitual offenders, providing for indeterminate or determinate sentences for offenders found to be dangerous who would be eligible for [[parole]] after three years and has the authority to extend such indeterminate non-parole period at any time.<ref>http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/PUB/C20.htm#canad  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722101411/http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/PUB/C20.htm#canad |date=July 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\nIn 1930, the town of [[Guangzhou]] enacted a [[mandatory death penalty]] for those offenders who received their third conviction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19301116&id=ZZAxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y00DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2394,5830971|title=Canton restaures death penalty to halt crime|date=November 16, 1930|access-date=September 11, 2017|agency=Associated Press|page=13}}</ref>\n\n=== France ===\nFrom 2007 to 2014, [[France]] had <span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"fr\">''peines planchers''</span> (literally \"floor sentences\"), which set a minimum floor to the sentences of recidivist offenders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/decouverte-institutions/justice/fonctionnement/justice-penale/que-sont-peines-plancher.html|title=Quentend-on par \" peines planchers \" ?|date=2014-09-17|website=Vie publique|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\nEnacted under President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20070726.OBS8252/le-projet-de-loi-contre-la-recidive-est-definitivement-adopte.html|title=Le projet de loi contre la r\u00e9cidiveest d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9|work=L'Obs|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr-FR}}</ref> they were repealed under his successor [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/06/05/les-deputes-suppriment-les-peines-planchers_4433100_3224.html|title=Suppression des \" peines planchers \", symbole du quinquennat Sarkozy|date=2014-06-05|work=Le Monde|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}</ref> which made this point a part of [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande presidential campaign, 2012|his platform]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/09/19/quel-bilan-pour-les-peines-planchers_1762046_3224.html|title=Suppression des peines plancher, mesure phare du quinquennat Sarkozy|last=B\u00e9guin|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=2012-09-19|work=Le Monde|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\nBased on earlier reform plans, the [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist regime]] issued in 1933 the so-called ''Gewohnheitsverbrechergesetz'' against 'criminals by habit'; not only was the punishment raised, it also introduced a [[preventive detention]] to be reconsidered every three years. After 1945, the Allied military governments did not contest this law, and its regulations were taken over in 1953 into the German penal code [[Strafgesetzbuch]].  In 1969, the liberalization of civil and penal law made it more difficult to impose preventive detention and other measures. Contrary to the situation in the US, the discretion lies with the sentencing judge.\n\n===Hungary===\nIn [[Hungary]], the [[Fidesz]]-dominated new parliament changed the Penal Code, introducing a habitual criminal statute for repeat offenders and acts of [[recividism]] <ref>[http://www.politics.hu/20100609/parliament-passes-laws-on-smaller-local-councils-asset-management-penal-code Parliament passes laws on smaller local councils, asset management, penal code], June 09, 2010, politics.hu.</ref> on June 8, 2010. The change has been signed into law. The law is codified under Sections 89 and 90 of the Hungarian Criminal Code.  The law explicitly denies parole for any person convicted of certain serious offences, including murder, that was a repeat offender at the time of the offence. Moreover, the law mandates a sentence of [[life imprisonment]] for any person that is a repeat offender of any offences that would exceed twenty years, or if any of the offenses carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20100624-solyom-laszlo-alairta-a-btk-szigoritasarol-es-a-harom-csapasrol.html S\u00f3lyom al\u00e1\u00edrta a h\u00e1rom csap\u00e1st bevezet\u0151 t\u00f6rv\u00e9nyt, origo.hu]</ref>\n\n===India===\nThe [[Criminal Tribes Act]], 1872 was amended a number of times. After Independence, the leaders and social reformers paid attention to this problem. In 1949, the Central government appointed a committee to study the utility of the existence of this law. The committee viewed that the act was against the spirit of the Indian Constitution. It recommended suitable steps to be taken for amelioration of the pitiable conditions of the Criminal Tribes rather than stigmatising them as criminals. As a result, the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed in 1952 and the '''Habitual Offenders Act''' was enacted in its place. According to the Habitual Offenders Act, a habitual offender is one who has been a victim of subjective and objective influences and has manifested a set practice in crime, and also presents a danger to the society in which they live. The Habitual Offenders are usually hardened criminals whose major part of life has been spent in jails. It is because they commit offences at frequent intervals and are sent back to jail.\n\n===Pakistan===\nSection 75 of the Pakistan Penal Code deals with Habitual Offenders. The provisions are activated upon a second conviction for a crime with a minimum sentence of three years imprisonment. The Guidelines for sentencing given to criminal court indicate that the discretion lies with the judge, and an enhanced sentence is not mandatory, and should usually not be given in less serious criminal cases (such as petty theft) or where the convictions are old. The judge is expected to adopt an individualized view and tailor both the decision of awarding an enhanced sentence and the length of it to the case at hand. For this the transcripts of the previous trials can be used.<ref>http://www.lhc.gov.pk/rulesorder/vol_3/v3ch23-b.htm  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120160620/http://www.lhc.gov.pk/rulesorder/vol_3/v3ch23-b.htm|date=November 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] have passed laws which require the [[State court (United States)|state courts]] to hand down a mandatory and extended sentences to habitual offenders (for example, making the repeated commission of the same [[misdemeanor]] a [[felony]]). [[Three strikes law]]s specifically target those who have been convicted of a serious criminal [[Offense (law)|offense]] on three or more separate occasions.\n\n==Criticism==\nThere has been various criticism of Habitual Offender Laws. Some examples are included below.\n\n===Unjust and unusual results===\nHabitual Offender laws, depending on their scope and discretionary room given to judges, can lead to persons being punished quite severely for relatively minor offenses. The discretionary nature of the laws means that they can be applied unevenly.\n\nIn Australia, laws relating to dangerous and Habitual offenders have been criticized as ignoring the principle of certainty in sentencing. Another major concern in Australia is the considerable disparity that exists in the requirements for dangerous offender status and in the available sentences for such offenders across jurisdictions. Age and offense requirements, indeterminate or fixed sentencing provisions, and review procedures are quite different from state to state;<ref name=\"johnhoward\" /> these inconsistencies have been removed to some extent in the past decade.\n\nSome unusual scenarios have arisen, particularly in California in the United States&nbsp;&mdash; the state punishes shoplifting and similar crimes involving over $500 in property as [[felony petty theft]] if the person who committed the crime has a prior conviction for any form of [[theft]], including [[robbery]] or [[burglary]]. As a result, some defendants have been given sentences of 25 years to life in prison for such crimes as [[shoplifting]] golf clubs (Gary Ewing, previous strikes for burglary and robbery with a knife), nine videotapes ([[Leandro Andrade]], 50 years to life for two counts of shoplifting), or, along with a violent assault, a slice of pepperoni pizza from a group of children (Jerry Dewayne Williams, four previous non-violent felonies, sentence later reduced to six years on appeal), some have even been sentenced to life without parole for nonviolent crimes ([[Alice Marie Johnson]], and Alvin Kennard).\n\n===Undue prosecutorial leverage===\nHabitual Offender laws also give prosecutors more power to force a defendant to plea bargain, as often the only deviation from a mandatory minimum sentence is with prosecutor approval.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Tina M.|title=Strike One, Ready for More?: The Consequences of Plea Bargaining \"First Strike\" Offenders under California's \"Three Strikes\" Law|journal=California Western Law Review|date=2000|volume=36|issue=2|pages=18 (fn 162)|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.cwsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1230&context=cwlr|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en|issn=0008-1639}}</ref>\n\n===Compatibility with fundamental rights===\nThe laws have been challenged on the basis of violating fundamental rights.\n\nIn the US on March 5, 2003, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held by a 5\u20134 majority that such sentences do not violate the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishment.\"<ref>Linda Greenhouse, \"Justices Uphold Long Sentences In Repeat Cases,\" ''[[New York Times]]'', 6 March 2003, A1.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aggravation (legal concept)]]\n* [[Recidivism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.asianlii.org/pk/legis/pj/consol_act/rohoa1918386/ Restriction of Habitual Offenders (Punjab) Act 1918] at ''Asian Legal Information Institute''.\n\n[[Category:Criminal law]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement]]\n", "text_old": "A '''habitual offender''', '''repeat offender''', or '''career criminal''' is a person convicted of a new crime who was previously convicted of a crimes.

The decision passed by the court is not reviewable; the indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed and release is by way of an order from the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"johnhoward\" />\n\n====Western Australia====\nThe ''Criminal Code Act 1913'' (WA) and the ''Crimes (Serious and Repeat Offenders) Act 1992 ''(WA) contain provisions for the indeterminate incarceration of youths and adults convicted of particular offenses. The indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and release is through a Supreme Court Order or at the discretion of the Governor.<ref name=\"johnhoward\" />\n\n====The Northern Territory and South Australia====\nThe ''Criminal Code Act 1983'' (NT) and the ''Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988'' (SA) allow for the indeterminate incarceration of a person who is determined to be a habitual criminal and/or incapable of controlling their sexual urges.\n\nIn South Australia, the indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and are reviewed every three years after that. Release is only by way of an order from the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"johnhoward\" />\n\nIn the Northern Territory, a prisoner serving indefinite sentence(s) has a nominal sentence set at half the sentence that would have been imposed if not they were not dangerous, or 20 years (25 years in some circumstances) if the sentence imposed would have been one or more consecutive sentences of life imprisonment. The indeterminate sentence(s) must be reviewed by the court when the nominal sentence (the minimum term the offender would have been required to serve if they were ''not'' dangerous) has expired, and every three years after.\n\n====The Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, and Victoria====\nThe ''Sentencing Act 2005'' (ACT), the ''Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003'' (Qld), and the ''Sentencing Act 1991'' (Vic) govern habitual offenders. An offender can be incarcerated indeterminately if there is a high probability, given the offender's character, the nature of their offense, psychiatric evidence as to the dangerousness of the defendant, and any other relevant circumstances, that the offender poses a serious threat to the community. The indeterminate sentence(s) must be reviewed by the court when the nominal sentence (the minimum term the offender would have been required to serve if they were ''not'' dangerous) has expired, and every three years after.\n\nThe minimum nominal sentence that can be imposed is ten years, but the sentencing judge can extend this if they believe that the prisoner's criminal history and/or the nature of the prisoner's offending warrants it.\n\nThe longest nominal sentence on sentence(s) of indeterminate imprisonment is 30 years, currently being served by serial pedophile Geoffrey Robert Dobbs (Queensland), who pleaded guilty to 124 sex offences and one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice committed against 63 girls aged between one month and 15 years (including five family members) under his care as a teacher and youth leader from 1972 to 2000.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], the Habitual Offender Act in Canada dealt with multiple offenders. The law was repealed after a Law Commission Report of 1969 found it to be erratically applied and was often used against non-violent and non-dangerous offenders. In 1977, Part XXIV of the Criminal Code was enacted for habitual offenders, providing for indeterminate or determinate sentences for offenders found to be dangerous who would be eligible for [[parole]] after three years and has the authority to extend such indeterminate non-parole period at any time.<ref>http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/PUB/C20.htm#canad  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722101411/http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/PUB/C20.htm#canad |date=July 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\nIn 1930, the town of [[Guangzhou]] enacted a [[mandatory death penalty]] for those offenders who received their third conviction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19301116&id=ZZAxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y00DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2394,5830971|title=Canton restaures death penalty to halt crime|date=November 16, 1930|access-date=September 11, 2017|agency=Associated Press|page=13}}</ref>\n\n=== France ===\nFrom 2007 to 2014, [[France]] had <span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"fr\">''peines planchers''</span> (literally \"floor sentences\"), which set a minimum floor to the sentences of recidivist offenders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/decouverte-institutions/justice/fonctionnement/justice-penale/que-sont-peines-plancher.html|title=Quentend-on par \" peines planchers \" ?|date=2014-09-17|website=Vie publique|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\nEnacted under President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20070726.OBS8252/le-projet-de-loi-contre-la-recidive-est-definitivement-adopte.html|title=Le projet de loi contre la r\u00e9cidiveest d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9|work=L'Obs|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr-FR}}</ref> they were repealed under his successor [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/06/05/les-deputes-suppriment-les-peines-planchers_4433100_3224.html|title=Suppression des \" peines planchers \", symbole du quinquennat Sarkozy|date=2014-06-05|work=Le Monde|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}</ref> which made this point a part of [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande presidential campaign, 2012|his platform]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/09/19/quel-bilan-pour-les-peines-planchers_1762046_3224.html|title=Suppression des peines plancher, mesure phare du quinquennat Sarkozy|last=B\u00e9guin|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=2012-09-19|work=Le Monde|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\nBased on earlier reform plans, the [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist regime]] issued in 1933 the so-called ''Gewohnheitsverbrechergesetz'' against 'criminals by habit'; not only was the punishment raised, it also introduced a [[preventive detention]] to be reconsidered every three years. After 1945, the Allied military governments did not contest this law, and its regulations were taken over in 1953 into the German penal code [[Strafgesetzbuch]].  In 1969, the liberalization of civil and penal law made it more difficult to impose preventive detention and other measures. Contrary to the situation in the US, the discretion lies with the sentencing judge.\n\n===Hungary===\nIn [[Hungary]], the [[Fidesz]]-dominated new parliament changed the Penal Code, introducing a habitual criminal statute for repeat offenders and acts of [[recividism]] <ref>[http://www.politics.hu/20100609/parliament-passes-laws-on-smaller-local-councils-asset-management-penal-code Parliament passes laws on smaller local councils, asset management, penal code], June 09, 2010, politics.hu.</ref> on June 8, 2010. The change has been signed into law. The law is codified under Sections 89 and 90 of the Hungarian Criminal Code.  The law explicitly denies parole for any person convicted of certain serious offences, including murder, that was a repeat offender at the time of the offence. Moreover, the law mandates a sentence of [[life imprisonment]] for any person that is a repeat offender of any offences that would exceed twenty years, or if any of the offenses carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20100624-solyom-laszlo-alairta-a-btk-szigoritasarol-es-a-harom-csapasrol.html S\u00f3lyom al\u00e1\u00edrta a h\u00e1rom csap\u00e1st bevezet\u0151 t\u00f6rv\u00e9nyt, origo.hu]</ref>\n\n===India===\nThe [[Criminal Tribes Act]], 1872 was amended a number of times. After Independence, the leaders and social reformers paid attention to this problem. In 1949, the Central government appointed a committee to study the utility of the existence of this law. The committee viewed that the act was against the spirit of the Indian Constitution. It recommended suitable steps to be taken for amelioration of the pitiable conditions of the Criminal Tribes rather than stigmatising them as criminals. As a result, the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed in 1952 and the '''Habitual Offenders Act''' was enacted in its place. According to the Habitual Offenders Act, a habitual offender is one who has been a victim of subjective and objective influences and has manifested a set practice in crime, and also presents a danger to the society in which they live. The Habitual Offenders are usually hardened criminals whose major part of life has been spent in jails. It is because they commit offences at frequent intervals and are sent back to jail.\n\n===Pakistan===\nSection 75 of the Pakistan Penal Code deals with Habitual Offenders. The provisions are activated upon a second conviction for a crime with a minimum sentence of three years imprisonment. The Guidelines for sentencing given to criminal court indicate that the discretion lies with the judge, and an enhanced sentence is not mandatory, and should usually not be given in less serious criminal cases (such as petty theft) or where the convictions are old. The judge is expected to adopt an individualized view and tailor both the decision of awarding an enhanced sentence and the length of it to the case at hand. For this the transcripts of the previous trials can be used.<ref>http://www.lhc.gov.pk/rulesorder/vol_3/v3ch23-b.htm  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120160620/http://www.lhc.gov.pk/rulesorder/vol_3/v3ch23-b.htm|date=November 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] have passed laws which require the [[State court (United States)|state courts]] to hand down a mandatory and extended sentences to habitual offenders (for example, making the repeated commission of the same [[misdemeanor]] a [[felony]]). [[Three strikes law]]s specifically target those who have been convicted of a serious criminal [[Offense (law)|offense]] on three or more separate occasions.\n\n==Criticism==\nThere has been various criticism of Habitual Offender Laws. Some examples are included below.\n\n===Unjust and unusual results===\nHabitual Offender laws, depending on their scope and discretionary room given to judges, can lead to persons being punished quite severely for relatively minor offenses. The discretionary nature of the laws means that they can be applied unevenly.\n\nIn Australia, laws relating to dangerous and Habitual offenders have been criticized as ignoring the principle of certainty in sentencing. Another major concern in Australia is the considerable disparity that exists in the requirements for dangerous offender status and in the available sentences for such offenders across jurisdictions. Age and offense requirements, indeterminate or fixed sentencing provisions, and review procedures are quite different from state to state;<ref name=\"johnhoward\" /> these inconsistencies have been removed to some extent in the past decade.\n\nSome unusual scenarios have arisen, particularly in California in the United States&nbsp;&mdash; the state punishes shoplifting and similar crimes involving over $500 in property as [[felony petty theft]] if the person who committed the crime has a prior conviction for any form of [[theft]], including [[robbery]] or [[burglary]]. As a result, some defendants have been given sentences of 25 years to life in prison for such crimes as [[shoplifting]] golf clubs (Gary Ewing, previous strikes for burglary and robbery with a knife), nine videotapes ([[Leandro Andrade]], 50 years to life for two counts of shoplifting), or, along with a violent assault, a slice of pepperoni pizza from a group of children (Jerry Dewayne Williams, four previous non-violent felonies, sentence later reduced to six years on appeal), some have even been sentenced to life without parole for nonviolent crimes ([[Alice Marie Johnson]], and Alvin Kennard).\n\n===Undue prosecutorial leverage===\nHabitual Offender laws also give prosecutors more power to force a defendant to plea bargain, as often the only deviation from a mandatory minimum sentence is with prosecutor approval.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Tina M.|title=Strike One, Ready for More?: The Consequences of Plea Bargaining \"First Strike\" Offenders under California's \"Three Strikes\" Law|journal=California Western Law Review|date=2000|volume=36|issue=2|pages=18 (fn 162)|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.cwsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1230&context=cwlr|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en|issn=0008-1639}}</ref>\n\n===Compatibility with fundamental rights===\nThe laws have been challenged on the basis of violating fundamental rights.\n\nIn the US on March 5, 2003, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held by a 5\u20134 majority that such sentences do not violate the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishment.\"<ref>Linda Greenhouse, \"Justices Uphold Long Sentences In Repeat Cases,\" ''[[New York Times]]'', 6 March 2003, A1.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aggravation (legal concept)]]\n* [[Recidivism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.asianlii.org/pk/legis/pj/consol_act/rohoa1918386/ Restriction of Habitual Offenders (Punjab) Act 1918] at ''Asian Legal Information Institute''.\n\n[[Category:Criminal law]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement]]\n", "name_user": "Opencooper", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:I played myself...", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_offender"}

Measures included:\n\n* The ability to force businesses to shut and crack down on people who leave their homes without a \"reasonable excuse\".\n* Penalties, ranging from fixed penalty notices to fines of up to \u00a35,000, are being introduced as enforcement.\n* Anyone who can work from home must work from home\n* Employers must facilitate working from home where it is feasible\n* No employer should compel an employee to come to work if it is feasible to work from home\n* Every employer must take all reasonable steps to safeguard the health, safety and wellbeing of employees during the COVID-19 emergency, whether working from home or in the workplace\n* Every employer must have particular regard to the safety of employees in the workplace and must put into effect the guidance on social distancing issued by the Department for the Economy\n* Every employer has a legal duty to ensure, so far as it is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all employees\n* Where a business is failing to observe the Department for the Economy guidance and breaching the legal duty on health and safety, the statutory authorities will take robust action, which may include prosecution for criminal offences\n* Where necessary, the Executive Office will also use its power of direction to close or restrict businesses that do not ensure the safety of their employees.\n\nCommenting on the new measures, Arlene Foster said \"We are asking the people of Northern Ireland to make fundamental changes to how they live their lives. But we are doing this to keep you safe, to flatten the curve of the Covid-19 infection so that the health service has the capacity to deal with those who need their help the most.\" Deputy First Minister [[Michelle O'Neill]] also commented \"Each one of us has a personal responsibility to do everything we can to fight back against Covid-19 for the good of everyone across society.

We will use every power we have to ensure people stay at home so that we save as many lives as we possibly can.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52079959 |title=Coronavirus: New regulations come into force|accessdate=28 March 2020|work=[[BBC]]|date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0328/1127017-northern-irish-figures/ |title=Sweeping new powers to combat virus for Northern Ireland|accessdate=28 March 2020|work=[[RTE]]|date=28 March 2020|last1=Kearney|first1=Vincent}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/news/executive-approves-new-powers-protect-public |title=Executive approves new powers to protect the public|accessdate=28 March 2020|work=NI Executive|date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 March new cases announced by the Public Health Service were 86 and 6 new deaths, the highest for both in a single day to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52084560 |title=Coronavirus: Six more deaths in Northern Ireland|accessdate=29 March 2020|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the announcement on 31 March that there were 53 new cases and 6 new deaths, the totals at the end of the month of March were 586 confirmed cases and 28 deaths.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52104195 |title=Coronavirus: Six more people die in Northern Ireland\n|accessdate=31 March 2020|work=[[BBC]]|date=31 March 2020\n}}</ref>\n\n===April 2020===\n\n[[File:A_deserted_A1_near_Newry.jpg|thumb|A deserted A1 on the outskirts of [[Newry]] during lockdown on 4 April.]]\nOn 1 April a further 103 cases and 2 deaths were confirmed as Health Minister Robin Swann warned that 3000 people could die in the first wave of the pandemic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52121143 |title=Coronavirus: NI could see 3,000 deaths in 'first wave'|accessdate=1 April 2020|work=[[BBC]]|date=April 2020}}</ref> On 2 April 85 more cases and 6 more deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 774 and 36 respectively.<ref name=\"2April\">{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-updates-diane-dodds-outlines-massive-shock-to-economy-as-six-further-deaths-in-northern-ireland-confirmed-39096431.html|title=Coronavirus updates: Diane Dodds outlines 'massive shock' to economy as six further deaths in Northern Ireland confirmed|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|first=Gareth|last=Cross|date=2 April 2020|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> On 3 April the largest increase in deaths and cases to date was published by the Public Health Agency with 130 cases and 12 deaths, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 904 and the number of deaths to 48.<ref name=\"3April\">{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-updates-12-more-deaths-in-northern-ireland-and-130-new-covid-19-cases-39099564.html|title=Coronavirus updates: 12 more deaths in Northern Ireland and 130 new Covid-19 cases|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|first1=Andrew|last1=Madden|first2=Gareth|last2=Cross|date=3 April 2020|accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nOn Saturday 4 April a further 94 new cases and 8 new deaths were announced, as Northern Ireland's first coronavirus testing centre for healthcare workers opened at the [[SSE Arena, Belfast]].<ref name=\"4 April\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52166720|title=Coronavirus: Eight more Covid-19 linked deaths in NI|work=[[BBC]]|date=4 April 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Health Minister Robin Swann said the new testing facility in Belfast \u201cwill allay some of the concern and speculation we have had of late.
