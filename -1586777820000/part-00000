{"title_page": "Role of music in World War II", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=February 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n}}\n[[World War II]] was the first conflict to take place in the age of electronically mass distributed music.\n\nMany people in the war and the need to listened to radio and long playing records en masse.  By 1940, 96.2% of Northeastern American urban households had [[radio]]. The lowest American demographic to embrace mass distributed music, Southern rural families, still had 1 radio for every two households.<ref>[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/118953906_1.html \"How America adopted radio: demographic differences in set ownership reported in the 1930\u20131950 U.S. censuses\" by Steve Craig June 2004.]</ref>\n\nSimilar adoption rates of electronically mass distributed music occurred in Europe.  During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule, radio ownership in [[Germany]] rose from 4 to 16 million households.<ref>[http://www.historyonthenet.com/Nazi_Germany/propaganda.htm http://www.historyonthenet.com]</ref> As the major powers entered the war, millions of citizens had home radio devices that did not exist in the [[World War I|First World War]]. Also during the pre-war period, sound was introduced to cinema and [[musicals]] were very popular.\n\nTherefore, World War II was a unique situation for music and its relationship to warfare. Never before was it possible for not only single songs, but also single recordings of songs to be so widely distributed to the population. Never before had the number of listeners to a single performance (a recording or broadcast production) been so high. Also, never before had [[Sovereign state|states]] had so much power to determine not only what songs were performed and listened to, but to control the recordings not allowing local people to alter the songs in their own performances. Though local people still sang and produced songs, this form of music faced serious new competition from centralized electronic distributed music.\n\n==German English song==\n\"[[Lili Marlene]]\" was the most popular song of World War II with both German and [[United Kingdom|British]] forces. Based on a German poem, the song was recorded in both [[English language|English]] and German versions. The poem was set to music in 1938 and was a hit with troops in the [[Afrika Korps]]. Mobile desert combat required a large number of radio units and the [[British troops]] in the [[North African Campaign]] started to enjoy the song so much that it was quickly translated into English. The song was used throughout the war as not only a popular song, but a propaganda tool.\n\n==American songs==\n{{main|American music during World War II}}\n\nAmerican troops had regular access to radio in all but the most difficult combat situations, and not only did soldiers know specific songs, but specific recordings.

In ''[[Sounds of War: Music in the United States during World War II]]'', it is made clear that music composed had various purposes, but more importantly it mentions the tension that grew between institutions in order to find the right way to use music for U.S overall interest. Examples can be seen throughout the different types of songs being produced and publicized during this time. Songs like ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1938) and ''[[Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition]]'' (1942) were songs that kept the citizens back in the U.S calm and hopeful for the return of their loved ones.<ref name=fauser>{{cite book|title=Sounds of War: Music in the United States during World War II|last=Fauser|first=Annegret|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2013|isbn=978-0-19-932376-0}}</ref> On the other hand, these songs had other effects on the soldiers fighting abroad. For them songs like these brought nostalgia and homesickness.\n \nWith the war brewing through the 1940s, initiatives to help the soldiers continue fighting arose. With drafting numbers reaching close to 500,000, the Army along with other Defense institutions began to make military bands which would serve the purpose of boosting morale in the home front, while at the same time keeping patriotism and nationalism at an all-time high. The first patriotic war song of WWII in the U.S. was \"''[[God Bless America]]'',\" written by Irving Berlin for a World War I wartime revue, but was withheld and later revised and used in World War II.<ref name=winkler>{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Sheldon|title=The Music of World War II: War Songs and their Stories|location=Bennington|publisher=Merriam Press|date=2013|isbn=978-1-4825-3626-3}}</ref> There were many other popular patriotic wartime songs during this time such as, \"''[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]''\" by Glenn Miller and \"Arms for the Love of America\" by once again Irving Berlin in 1941.<ref name=winkler/>\n\nAfter successful incorporation of music into the war efforts, more was needed in order to keep hopes alive and stable both back in the U.S and in the Home Front. Various times music was used as a tool for battle in the war, whether it was to entertain or to recuperate the soldiers during the war.<ref name=fauser /> More importantly was the impact that the music during the 1940s had on the people then and the effect that it continues to have now. Sounds of War: Music in the United States during World War II argues that music composed during the 1940s was unlike any other time of music because of its emphasis on making the listener feel like they are part of the war or if they are somewhere else.<ref name=fauser /> It adds that songs from World War II continue to be used today in order to remember those harsh times of war and to remind everyone of what the cost of liberty and freedom was.<ref name=fauser /> Some examples of this would include Aaron Copland's \"''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]''\" (1942) and \"''[[Lincoln's Portrait]]''\" (1942). These are still being played for presidential inaugurations and continue to have the effect of \"loss for freedom\".\n\nDuring the 1940s the [[United States State Department]] also encouraged the mutual exchange of music on the radio with the neutral countries of Latin America in order to promote President Franklin Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor policy]] and [[Pan-Americanism]].<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16152 \"84 - Executive Order 8840 Establishing the Office of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, July 30, 1941\"], ''The American Presidency Project''</ref> Through the establishment of the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (OIAA), President Roosevelt utilized music as a form of [[cultural diplomacy]] in order to improve [[international relations]] with Latin America and forestall the spread of military hostilities throughout the Americas.<ref>Media Sound & Culture in Latin America.

In 1952, the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] was established under the musical direction of the composer [[Samuel Adler (composer)|Samuel Adler]] in an effort to demonstrate the shared musical heritage of the United States and the vanquished nations of Europe. Through a series of live musical performances and broadcasts over the [[Armed Forces Radio]] Services network, the orchestra successfully promoted mutual understanding and peace between the German and American people for a decade until 1962.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9SOCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA311&dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra+Samuel+Adler&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ_s-XgYbdAhUHvlkKHU4nCjgQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Seventh%20Army%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20Samuel%20Adler&f=false ''A Dictionary for the Modern Composer''], Emily Freeman Brown, Scarecrow Press , Oxford, 2015, p. 311 {{ISBN|9780810884014}} ''Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra'' founded by Samuel Adler in 1952 on https://books.google.com</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MMwkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlxeykrIbdAhXOslkKHXP1A5MQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&q=Seventh%20Army%20Symphony%20Orchestra&f=false ''New Music New Allies''] Amy C.

Whether women were incorporated because of sexual attraction or actual acceptance by the institutions is still not very clear, what is clear is that groups were now mixed sexes and some even mixed races in an era of sexism and racism.

This meant the American and British government could count on popular music reflecting much of the same war aims that the government wanted. The people of America wanted a quick final victory over the [[Axis powers|Axis]] without compromise and the songs about a world after the war at peace with the boys coming home not only meet the personal desires of people but also reflected the goals of US government. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] had always been motivated for a quick end to the war.\n\nThis unity of private and state desire likely gave the UK and the USA a degree of energy that allowed the nations to accomplish a great deal more at less human cost than the other major powers in the war. The mass suffering at the hands of the governments was not necessary as it was in Germany.\n\n==British popular music and the BBC==\nBefore the war, [[BBC radio]] had had quite an elitist approach to popular music. Jazz, swing or big band music for dancing was relegated to a few late night spots. During the war, the [[BBC]] was obliged to adapt, if only because British soldiers were listening to German radio stations to hear their dance music favourites.\n\nThis adaptation was not without conflict. The BBC establishment reluctantly increased the amount of dance music played, but [[censorship]] was severe. The American hit \"Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer\" for example was censored because of its almost blasphemous mix of religious words and a foxtrot melody. BBC heads were also worried about American-style crooners undermining the virility of British men.\n\nThe BBC establishment tried hard to stick to the jaunty tone which they felt had helped to win the first world war - so [[George Formby]] and [[Gracie Fields]] were very much played on the radio. Indeed, these two stars were undoubtedly more heroes to working-class people in Britain than was [[Winston Churchill]], since they were seen to \"come from the ordinary people.\"\n\nThe United States did not need a forward Propaganda Minister; it could count on big bands producing music that reflected the government's primary interests because those were the interests of the population.\n\nBritain did have a mass media which played popular music, much enjoyed by the Germans stationed in France and the Low Countries or flying over Britain. The most famous single performer was [[Vera Lynn]] who became known as \"the forces' sweetheart\".\n\nPopular concert songs in Britain during the war included:\n\n* [[Run Rabbit Run]] - Sung by [[Flanagan and Allen]] (1939) Words by [[Noel Gay]] & [[Ralph Butler]].

The Nazi government had an obsession with controlling culture and promoting the culture it controlled. For this reason the common people's tastes in music were much more secret. Many Germans used their new radios to listen to the [[jazz]] music hated by Hitler but loved all over the world.\n\nIn art, this attack came after [[expressionism]], [[impressionism]], and all forms of [[modernism]]. Forms of music targeted included [[jazz]] as well as the music of many of the more dissonant modern classical composers, including that of [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Hindemith was one of many composers who fled the Third Reich as a result of musical persecution (as well as racial persecution, since Hindemith's wife was part Jewish). Modern composers who took a more conventional approach to music, however, were welcomed by the Third Reich; [[Carl Orff]] and [[Richard Strauss]], for example, were able to stay in the country during the Nazi period.\n\nAlso a subtle factor of history makes gaining a reliable picture of the music of Germany more difficult than among the Allies. World War II in the English speaking world is usually remembered as a great triumph and the music is often performed with a sense of pride. Therefore, over time the collective consciousness of this period's music has become stronger. In Germany, World War II is generally seen as a shameful period; it would be difficult to imagine a band playing 'all the old favorites' of World War II in a public place.\n\nPopular music is tied with nostalgia and collective memory. Though a historian can find samples of music that were played in radio, or can collect soldiers' songs from a period, ranking the subjective meaning and value assigned to a song by the people of that period will be greatly impacted by those subjects' later opinion of that music.\n\nFor example, it is known that many Germans enjoyed American [[jazz]] music, it is also known that Germans sang songs in Nazi sponsored events; but it would be difficult to determine the relative popularity of this music in the current context of shame concerning the war.\n\nTherefore, the best that can be understood about German Music during the war is the official Nazi government policy, the level of enforcement, and some notion of the diversity of other music listened to, but as the losers in the war German Music and [[Nazi songs]] from World War II has not been assigned the high heroic status of American and British popular music.  As the music itself goes, however, it is considered by many as being above the level of the latter, which is also true of Fascist Italian music of the time.\n\n===Approved and unapproved German music===\nThe Nazis were dedicated to the concept that German Culture was the greatest in history, but, as with all parts of art, Hitler took an interest in suppressing the work of all those he considered \"unfit\" while promoting certain composers as proper Germans. All musicians were required to join the ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', or \"Reich Music Chamber\", part of the [[Reich Chamber of Culture]] founded by [[Joseph Goebbels]] in 1933. Membership required a so-called [[Aryan certificate]], meaning that Jewish musicians could no longer work.\n\nAlong with exhibitions of \"[[degenerate art]]\" (''[[entartete Kunst]]'') the Nazi government identified certain music, composers and performers as ''[[entartete Musik]]''. Designation into this category was based upon the race, ethnicity, and political orientation of the composers and performers in question. The works of Jewish composers were banned, including those of [[Mahler]], [[Mendelssohn]], [[Schoenberg]] and [[Debussy]] (who had a Jewish wife).\n\nIn 1938 Nazi Germany passed an official law on Jazz music. Not surprisingly it deals with the racial nature of the music and makes law based on racial theories. Jazz was \"Negroid\"; It posed a threat to European higher culture, and was therefore forbidden except in the case of scientific study.\n\n===Music permitted under the Nazis===\nThe Reichsmusikkammer promoted [[classical music]] by German composers such as [[Beethoven]] and [[Wagner]], as well as Austrians such as [[Mozart]]. Military music was also promoted, but lighter, non-political music was a source of escapism for many. The ''{{interlanguage link|Wunschkonzert f\u00fcr die Wehrmacht|de}}'', or \"Request Concert for the Armed Forces\", was a popular radio program broadcast from Berlin. The subject of a [[Wunschkonzert|1940 film]], it consisted of live music requested by soldiers. By connecting the military to the home front and vice versa, it contributed to the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'', the Nazi concept of a \"people's community\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The war that Hitler won : the most infamous propaganda campaign in history |publisher=Putnam |isbn=0-399-11845-4 |pages=294-295}}</ref>\n\nDegrees of censorship varied, and the Germans were likely more concerned with the war than styles of music. But as the war went poorly the objectives of the government moved from building a perfect German state to keeping the population in line, and the relative importance of morale-raising songs would have increased.\n\nPopular songs were officially encouraged during the war including:\n\n* \"Berlin bleibt doch Berlin!\" (Berlin is still Berlin) (words [[Bruno Balz]], music [[Will Meisel]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruno-balz.com/index.php/berlin-lieder|title=BERLIN - LIEDER - Der Textdichter Bruno Balz|year=2012|work=Bruno Balz - Archiv|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> was popular with [[Joseph Goebbels]] near the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n* ''\"[[Erika (song)|Erika]]\"'', a [[marching song]] about a soldier who misses his fianc\u00e9e, does not have political lyrics, but its composer, [[Herms Niel]], had joined the Nazi Party in 1934.\n\nA strange note is that Goebbels commissioned a swing band called \"[[Charlie and His Orchestra]]\" which seemed to have existed for propaganda purposes\n\n==Polish songs==\n{{See also|Polish_culture_during_World_War_II#Visual_arts_and_music|l1=Polish music in World War II}}\n\nThere were specific songs of [[Polish resistance in WWII|Polish resistance]], [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] and [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]]. Notable ones included ''[[Siekiera, motyka]]'', the most popular song in [[occupied Poland]]; '''Rozszumia\u0142y si\u0119 wierzby p\u0142acz\u0105ce''' - the most popular song of the Polish partisans; ''[[Czerwone maki na Monte Cassino]]'' - the most popular song of the Polish Armed Forces in the West;''[[Oka (song)|Oka]]'', the most popular song of the Polish Armed Forces in the East and ''[[Marsz Gwardii Ludowej]]'' - popular song also known as ''Partisans' Song'' anthem of [[Gwardia Ludowa|GL]].\n\n==Propaganda against the enemy==\n''They played a few American records first. I don't remember everything she said. She said, \"Your wives and girlfriends are probably home in a nice warm building, dancing with some other men. You're over here in the cold.\" It was cold and it was snowing.''\nDent Wheeler on Axis Sally during the battle of the Bulge<ref>Excerpt from Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge, edited by Robert Van Houten. Paducah, Kentucky: Turner Publishing Co., 1991. ({{ISBN|1-56311-013-X}})</ref>\n\n\"There is no 'Tokyo Rose'; the name is strictly a GI invention. The name has been applied to at least two lilting Japanese voices on the Japanese radio.&nbsp;... Government monitors listening in 24 hours a day have never heard the words 'Tokyo Rose' over a Japanese-controlled Far Eastern radio.\"<ref>The U.S. Office of War Information, August 1945</ref>\n\nDuring World War II often cut off troops or isolated outposts found themselves exposed in the radio range of the enemy, which used popular music as a means to attract listeners and then provide propaganda messages.\n\nThis type of propaganda was performed by both sides and is some of the earliest mass psych-ops. Often the propagandist became popular with the other sides, and there is little evidence that these had any impact, except that the Axis participants were often detained and if originally from allied countries prosecuted, while Allied broadcasters were seen as legitimate. Again it shows the way music is understood in the context of World War II is from the winners point of view, whereas [[Tokyo Rose]] ([[Iva Ikuko Toguri D'Aquino]]) and [[Mildred Gillars|Axis Sally]] ([[Mildred Gillars]]) faced years of persecution after the war.\nEngland executed [[Lord Haw Haw]] ([[William Joyce]]) for treason, in 1946. Again there can really be little in the way of an objective history of music in World War II. The historical context since the war, the revelations of the evils of the Axis regimes, and the ultimate victory of the consumer society foretold in the songs of the allies impose a context upon the events like viewing a star through the lens of a telescope.\n\n==Songs, compositions and others written after the war==\n* ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'', by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] in 1960\n* ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' by [[George Duning]] and [[Morris Stoloff]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for best musical score.\n* ''[[The Hiroshima Symphony]]'', by [[Erkki Aaltonen]] in 1949\n* ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] describes the horrors of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].\n* ''[[On The Nameless Height (song)|On The Nameless Height]]''\n* ''[[Sink the Bismark]]'' (''sic'', later corrected to \"Sink the Bismarck\"), a 1960 song by [[Johnny Horton]] about the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|sinking]] of that battleship in 1941.\n* ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' - Musical produced and directed by [[Hal Prince]] in 1966, narrates the [[Nazi Party]] ascent to power, featuring a song expressing Nazi ideology \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\".\n* [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' is famous for perhaps the strangest song about World War II, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\".\n* ''[[Den Pobedy]]'' (\"Victory Day\")\n* ''[[Last King Tiger]]'' by [[Ignitor (band)|Ignitor]] is about the Russian invasion to Berlin and the fall of the Reich.\n* ''[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]'', ''[[Bring the Boys Back Home]]'' and other songs by [[Pink Floyd]].\n<!--commenting out: interesting, but not sure how _original_ these are:\n* [[Gravity's Rainbow]] contains a number of songs about the situation at the end of, and just after WWII in Europe.-->\n* [[Coat_of_Arms_(album)|Uprising]], which is about [[Warsaw Uprising]], the song '''Bismarck''' is about the [[Last_battle_of_the_battleship_Bismarck|last battle]] of the Germany's largest battleship [[German_battleship_Bismarck|Bismarck]]  and other songs of world war 2 from [[Sabaton_(band)|Sabaton]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Music and political warfare]]\n*[[Interpretive communities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* \"The Songs that Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home Front, 1939\u20131945\" By [[John Bush Jones]]\n* \"God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War\" By Kathleen E.R.

By 1940, 96.2% of Northeastern American urban households had [[radio]]. The lowest American demographic to embrace mass distributed music, Southern rural families, still had 1 radio for every two households.<ref>[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/118953906_1.html \"How America adopted radio: demographic differences in set ownership reported in the 1930\u20131950 U.S. censuses\" by Steve Craig June 2004.]</ref>\n\nSimilar adoption rates of electronically mass distributed music occurred in Europe.  During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule, radio ownership in [[Germany]] rose from 4 to 16 million households.<ref>[http://www.historyonthenet.com/Nazi_Germany/propaganda.htm http://www.historyonthenet.com]</ref> As the major powers entered the war, millions of citizens had home radio devices that did not exist in the [[World War I|First World War]]. Also during the pre-war period, sound was introduced to cinema and [[musicals]] were very popular.\n\nTherefore, World War II was a unique situation for music and its relationship to warfare. Never before was it possible for not only single songs, but also single recordings of songs to be so widely distributed to the population. Never before had the number of listeners to a single performance (a recording or broadcast production) been so high. Also, never before had [[Sovereign state|states]] had so much power to determine not only what songs were performed and listened to, but to control the recordings not allowing local people to alter the songs in their own performances. Though local people still sang and produced songs, this form of music faced serious new competition from centralized electronic distributed music.\n\n==German English song==\n\"[[Lili Marlene]]\" was the most popular song of World War II with both German and [[United Kingdom|British]] forces. Based on a German poem, the song was recorded in both [[English language|English]] and German versions. The poem was set to music in 1938 and was a hit with troops in the [[Afrika Korps]]. Mobile desert combat required a large number of radio units and the [[British troops]] in the [[North African Campaign]] started to enjoy the song so much that it was quickly translated into English. The song was used throughout the war as not only a popular song, but a propaganda tool.\n\n==American songs==\n{{main|American music during World War II}}\n\nAmerican troops had regular access to radio in all but the most difficult combat situations, and not only did soldiers know specific songs, but specific recordings. This gave a nature to American troops music during WWII, not as much songs sung around a fire or while marching, but listened to between combat on Armed Forces Radio.\n\n* \"[[Amor (1943 song)|Amor]]\" - [[Andy Russell (singer) | Andy Russell]] with [[Al Sack]] & His Orchestra (1944)\n* \"[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive]]\" - [[Johnny Mercer]] (1944)\n* \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\" - [[Andy Russell (singer) | Andy Russell]] with [[Al Sack]] & His Orchestra\n* \"[[Be Careful, It's My Heart]]\" - Composer: [[Irving Berlin]] - From: Movie [[Holiday Inn]] (1942)\n* \"[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]\" - [[Andrews Sisters]] (1941)\"\n* \"[[Comin' In On A Wing And A Prayer]]\" - The Song Spinners\n* \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]\" - [[Spike Jones]] and his City Slickers (1943)\n* \"Remember Pearl Harbor\" - [[Sammy Kaye]] (1942)\n* \"[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]\" - [[Bing Crosby]] and [[The Andrews Sisters]] (Cover)\n* \"[[Don't Get Around Much Anymore]] (Never No Lament)\" - [[Duke Ellington]] & His Orchestra\n* \"[[Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree]] (With Anyone Else But Me)\" - Composer: [[Lew Brown]], [[Sam H.

In ''[[Sounds of War: Music in the United States during World War II]]'', it is made clear that music composed had various purposes, but more importantly it mentions the tension that grew between institutions in order to find the right way to use music for U.S overall interest. Examples can be seen throughout the different types of songs being produced and publicized during this time. Songs like ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1938) and ''[[Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition]]'' (1942) were songs that kept the citizens back in the U.S calm and hopeful for the return of their loved ones.<ref name=fauser>{{cite book|title=Sounds of War: Music in the United States during World War II|last=Fauser|first=Annegret|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2013|isbn=978-0-19-932376-0}}</ref> On the other hand, these songs had other effects on the soldiers fighting abroad. For them songs like these brought nostalgia and homesickness.\n \nWith the war brewing through the 1940s, initiatives to help the soldiers continue fighting arose. With drafting numbers reaching close to 500,000, the Army along with other Defense institutions began to make military bands which would serve the purpose of boosting morale in the home front, while at the same time keeping patriotism and nationalism at an all-time high. The first patriotic war song of WWII in the U.S. was \"''[[God Bless America]]'',\" written by Irving Berlin for a World War I wartime revue, but was withheld and later revised and used in World War II.<ref name=winkler>{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Sheldon|title=The Music of World War II: War Songs and their Stories|location=Bennington|publisher=Merriam Press|date=2013|isbn=978-1-4825-3626-3}}</ref> There were many other popular patriotic wartime songs during this time such as, \"''[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]''\" by Glenn Miller and \"Arms for the Love of America\" by once again Irving Berlin in 1941.<ref name=winkler/>\n\nAfter successful incorporation of music into the war efforts, more was needed in order to keep hopes alive and stable both back in the U.S and in the Home Front. Various times music was used as a tool for battle in the war, whether it was to entertain or to recuperate the soldiers during the war.<ref name=fauser /> More importantly was the impact that the music during the 1940s had on the people then and the effect that it continues to have now. Sounds of War: Music in the United States during World War II argues that music composed during the 1940s was unlike any other time of music because of its emphasis on making the listener feel like they are part of the war or if they are somewhere else.<ref name=fauser /> It adds that songs from World War II continue to be used today in order to remember those harsh times of war and to remind everyone of what the cost of liberty and freedom was.<ref name=fauser /> Some examples of this would include Aaron Copland's \"''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]''\" (1942) and \"''[[Lincoln's Portrait]]''\" (1942).

This meant the American and British government could count on popular music reflecting much of the same war aims that the government wanted. The people of America wanted a quick final victory over the [[Axis powers|Axis]] without compromise and the songs about a world after the war at peace with the boys coming home not only meet the personal desires of people but also reflected the goals of US government. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] had always been motivated for a quick end to the war.\n\nThis unity of private and state desire likely gave the UK and the USA a degree of energy that allowed the nations to accomplish a great deal more at less human cost than the other major powers in the war. The mass suffering at the hands of the governments was not necessary as it was in Germany.\n\n==British popular music and the BBC==\nBefore the war, [[BBC radio]] had had quite an elitist approach to popular music. Jazz, swing or big band music for dancing was relegated to a few late night spots. During the war, the [[BBC]] was obliged to adapt, if only because British soldiers were listening to German radio stations to hear their dance music favourites.\n\nThis adaptation was not without conflict. The BBC establishment reluctantly increased the amount of dance music played, but [[censorship]] was severe. The American hit \"Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer\" for example was censored because of its almost blasphemous mix of religious words and a foxtrot melody. BBC heads were also worried about American-style crooners undermining the virility of British men.\n\nThe BBC establishment tried hard to stick to the jaunty tone which they felt had helped to win the first world war - so [[George Formby]] and [[Gracie Fields]] were very much played on the radio. Indeed, these two stars were undoubtedly more heroes to working-class people in Britain than was [[Winston Churchill]], since they were seen to \"come from the ordinary people.\"\n\nThe United States did not need a forward Propaganda Minister; it could count on big bands producing music that reflected the government's primary interests because those were the interests of the population.\n\nBritain did have a mass media which played popular music, much enjoyed by the Germans stationed in France and the Low Countries or flying over Britain. The most famous single performer was [[Vera Lynn]] who became known as \"the forces' sweetheart\".\n\nPopular concert songs in Britain during the war included:\n\n* [[Run Rabbit Run]] - Sung by [[Flanagan and Allen]] (1939) Words by [[Noel Gay]] & [[Ralph Butler]]. Music by [[Noel Gay]].\n* [[There'll Always Be An England]] (1939\u201340) Words by [[Hughie Charles]]. Music by [[Ross Parker (songwriter)|Ross Parker]].

With lyrics by Jimmy Perry and music by Perry and Derek Taverner, it was sung by one of Perry's childhood idols, wartime entertainer [[Bud Flanagan]] who died in 1968, soon after the first episode played.\n\n==Russian songs==\n\n* \"[[Katyusha (song)|Katyusha]]\"\n* \"[[The 22 June song|Blue Kerchief]]\"\n* \"[[The Sacred War]]\"\n* \"[[Dark Is the Night (Soviet song)|Dark Is the Night]]\"\n* \"[[Farewell of Slavianka]]\"\n* \"[[March of the Soviet Tankmen]]\"\n* \"March of Stalin's Artillery\"\n* \"Ogoniok\" (Beacon)\n* \"Oy, Tumany\" (Oh, the Fogs)\n* \"V lesu prifrontovom\" (In a forest near the front)\n* \"\u017ddi Menia\" (Await Me)\n* [[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f:\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b|Category:World War II songs]] (in Russian)\n* [[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f:\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u043e \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0435|Category:Songs about World War II]] (in Russian)\n\n==German songs==\nThe [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] took a strong interest in promoting Germanic culture and music, which returned people to the folk culture of their remote ancestors, while promoting the distribution of radio to transmit propaganda. The Nazi government had an obsession with controlling culture and promoting the culture it controlled. For this reason the common people's tastes in music were much more secret. Many Germans used their new radios to listen to the [[jazz]] music hated by Hitler but loved all over the world.\n\nIn art, this attack came after [[expressionism]], [[impressionism]], and all forms of [[modernism]]. Forms of music targeted included [[jazz]] as well as the music of many of the more dissonant modern classical composers, including that of [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Hindemith was one of many composers who fled the Third Reich as a result of musical persecution (as well as racial persecution, since Hindemith's wife was part Jewish). Modern composers who took a more conventional approach to music, however, were welcomed by the Third Reich; [[Carl Orff]] and [[Richard Strauss]], for example, were able to stay in the country during the Nazi period.\n\nAlso a subtle factor of history makes gaining a reliable picture of the music of Germany more difficult than among the Allies. World War II in the English speaking world is usually remembered as a great triumph and the music is often performed with a sense of pride. Therefore, over time the collective consciousness of this period's music has become stronger. In Germany, World War II is generally seen as a shameful period; it would be difficult to imagine a band playing 'all the old favorites' of World War II in a public place.\n\nPopular music is tied with nostalgia and collective memory. Though a historian can find samples of music that were played in radio, or can collect soldiers' songs from a period, ranking the subjective meaning and value assigned to a song by the people of that period will be greatly impacted by those subjects' later opinion of that music.\n\nFor example, it is known that many Germans enjoyed American [[jazz]] music, it is also known that Germans sang songs in Nazi sponsored events; but it would be difficult to determine the relative popularity of this music in the current context of shame concerning the war.\n\nTherefore, the best that can be understood about German Music during the war is the official Nazi government policy, the level of enforcement, and some notion of the diversity of other music listened to, but as the losers in the war German Music and [[Nazi songs]] from World War II has not been assigned the high heroic status of American and British popular music.  As the music itself goes, however, it is considered by many as being above the level of the latter, which is also true of Fascist Italian music of the time.\n\n===Approved and unapproved German music===\nThe Nazis were dedicated to the concept that German Culture was the greatest in history, but, as with all parts of art, Hitler took an interest in suppressing the work of all those he considered \"unfit\" while promoting certain composers as proper Germans. All musicians were required to join the ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', or \"Reich Music Chamber\", part of the [[Reich Chamber of Culture]] founded by [[Joseph Goebbels]] in 1933. Membership required a so-called [[Aryan certificate]], meaning that Jewish musicians could no longer work.\n\nAlong with exhibitions of \"[[degenerate art]]\" (''[[entartete Kunst]]'') the Nazi government identified certain music, composers and performers as ''[[entartete Musik]]''. Designation into this category was based upon the race, ethnicity, and political orientation of the composers and performers in question. The works of Jewish composers were banned, including those of [[Mahler]], [[Mendelssohn]], [[Schoenberg]] and [[Debussy]] (who had a Jewish wife).\n\nIn 1938 Nazi Germany passed an official law on Jazz music. Not surprisingly it deals with the racial nature of the music and makes law based on racial theories. Jazz was \"Negroid\"; It posed a threat to European higher culture, and was therefore forbidden except in the case of scientific study.\n\n===Music permitted under the Nazis===\nThe Reichsmusikkammer promoted [[classical music]] by German composers such as [[Beethoven]] and [[Wagner]], as well as Austrians such as [[Mozart]]. Military music was also promoted, but lighter, non-political music was a source of escapism for many. The ''{{interlanguage link|Wunschkonzert f\u00fcr die Wehrmacht|de}}'', or \"Request Concert for the Armed Forces\", was a popular radio program broadcast from Berlin. The subject of a [[Wunschkonzert|1940 film]], it consisted of live music requested by soldiers. By connecting the military to the home front and vice versa, it contributed to the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'', the Nazi concept of a \"people's community\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The war that Hitler won : the most infamous propaganda campaign in history |publisher=Putnam |isbn=0-399-11845-4 |pages=294-295}}</ref>\n\nDegrees of censorship varied, and the Germans were likely more concerned with the war than styles of music. But as the war went poorly the objectives of the government moved from building a perfect German state to keeping the population in line, and the relative importance of morale-raising songs would have increased.\n\nPopular songs were officially encouraged during the war including:\n\n* \"Berlin bleibt doch Berlin!\" (Berlin is still Berlin) (words [[Bruno Balz]], music [[Will Meisel]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruno-balz.com/index.php/berlin-lieder|title=BERLIN - LIEDER - Der Textdichter Bruno Balz|year=2012|work=Bruno Balz - Archiv|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> was popular with [[Joseph Goebbels]] near the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n* ''\"[[Erika (song)|Erika]]\"'', a [[marching song]] about a soldier who misses his fianc\u00e9e, does not have political lyrics, but its composer, [[Herms Niel]], had joined the Nazi Party in 1934.\n\nA strange note is that Goebbels commissioned a swing band called \"[[Charlie and His Orchestra]]\" which seemed to have existed for propaganda purposes\n\n==Polish songs==\n{{See also|Polish_culture_during_World_War_II#Visual_arts_and_music|l1=Polish music in World War II}}\n\nThere were specific songs of [[Polish resistance in WWII|Polish resistance]], [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] and [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]]. Notable ones included ''[[Siekiera, motyka]]'', the most popular song in [[occupied Poland]]; '''Rozszumia\u0142y si\u0119 wierzby p\u0142acz\u0105ce''' - the most popular song of the Polish partisans; ''[[Czerwone maki na Monte Cassino]]'' - the most popular song of the Polish Armed Forces in the West;''[[Oka (song)|Oka]]'', the most popular song of the Polish Armed Forces in the East and ''[[Marsz Gwardii Ludowej]]'' - popular song also known as ''Partisans' Song'' anthem of [[Gwardia Ludowa|GL]].\n\n==Propaganda against the enemy==\n''They played a few American records first. I don't remember everything she said. She said, \"Your wives and girlfriends are probably home in a nice warm building, dancing with some other men. You're over here in the cold.\" It was cold and it was snowing.''\nDent Wheeler on Axis Sally during the battle of the Bulge<ref>Excerpt from Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge, edited by Robert Van Houten. Paducah, Kentucky: Turner Publishing Co., 1991. ({{ISBN|1-56311-013-X}})</ref>\n\n\"There is no 'Tokyo Rose'; the name is strictly a GI invention. The name has been applied to at least two lilting Japanese voices on the Japanese radio.&nbsp;... Government monitors listening in 24 hours a day have never heard the words 'Tokyo Rose' over a Japanese-controlled Far Eastern radio.\"<ref>The U.S. Office of War Information, August 1945</ref>\n\nDuring World War II often cut off troops or isolated outposts found themselves exposed in the radio range of the enemy, which used popular music as a means to attract listeners and then provide propaganda messages.\n\nThis type of propaganda was performed by both sides and is some of the earliest mass psych-ops. Often the propagandist became popular with the other sides, and there is little evidence that these had any impact, except that the Axis participants were often detained and if originally from allied countries prosecuted, while Allied broadcasters were seen as legitimate. Again it shows the way music is understood in the context of World War II is from the winners point of view, whereas [[Tokyo Rose]] ([[Iva Ikuko Toguri D'Aquino]]) and [[Mildred Gillars|Axis Sally]] ([[Mildred Gillars]]) faced years of persecution after the war.\nEngland executed [[Lord Haw Haw]] ([[William Joyce]]) for treason, in 1946. Again there can really be little in the way of an objective history of music in World War II. The historical context since the war, the revelations of the evils of the Axis regimes, and the ultimate victory of the consumer society foretold in the songs of the allies impose a context upon the events like viewing a star through the lens of a telescope.\n\n==Songs, compositions and others written after the war==\n* ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'', by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] in 1960\n* ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' by [[George Duning]] and [[Morris Stoloff]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for best musical score.\n* ''[[The Hiroshima Symphony]]'', by [[Erkki Aaltonen]] in 1949\n* ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] describes the horrors of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].\n* ''[[On The Nameless Height (song)|On The Nameless Height]]''\n* ''[[Sink the Bismark]]'' (''sic'', later corrected to \"Sink the Bismarck\"), a 1960 song by [[Johnny Horton]] about the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|sinking]] of that battleship in 1941.\n* ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' - Musical produced and directed by [[Hal Prince]] in 1966, narrates the [[Nazi Party]] ascent to power, featuring a song expressing Nazi ideology \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\".\n* [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' is famous for perhaps the strangest song about World War II, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\".\n* ''[[Den Pobedy]]'' (\"Victory Day\")\n* ''[[Last King Tiger]]'' by [[Ignitor (band)|Ignitor]] is about the Russian invasion to Berlin and the fall of the Reich.\n* ''[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]'', ''[[Bring the Boys Back Home]]'' and other songs by [[Pink Floyd]].\n<!--commenting out: interesting, but not sure how _original_ these are:\n* [[Gravity's Rainbow]] contains a number of songs about the situation at the end of, and just after WWII in Europe.-->\n* [[Coat_of_Arms_(album)|Uprising]], which is about [[Warsaw Uprising]], the song '''Bismarck''' is about the [[Last_battle_of_the_battleship_Bismarck|last battle]] of the Germany's largest battleship [[German_battleship_Bismarck|Bismarck]]  and other songs of world war 2 from [[Sabaton_(band)|Sabaton]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Music and political warfare]]\n*[[Interpretive communities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* \"The Songs that Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home Front, 1939\u20131945\" By [[John Bush Jones]]\n* \"God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War\" By Kathleen E.R.
