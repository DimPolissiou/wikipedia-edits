An early interest in mathematics led to a [[National Science Foundation]] scholarship for the high school summer program in mathematics at [[Bard College]] in 1977. From the age of fifteen, she took part in courses in painting and drawing at the [[Parsons School of Design]]'s Summer Program and the Saturday Program at [[Cooper Union]]. Scrima studied fine arts at the [[School of Visual Arts]] and received a BFA in 1983. In 1984, a scholarship from the [[:de:Stiftung Luftbr\u00fcckendank|Stiftung Luftbr\u00fcckendank]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffet|first=Cyril|title=50 Jahre Stiftung Luftbr\u00fcckendank 1959-2009|url=http://www.stiftung-luftbrueckendank.de/index_htm_files/festschrift.pdf|journal=50 Jahre Stiftung Luftbr\u00fcckendank 1959-2009}}</ref> brought her to West Berlin, where she received the German [[:de:Meistersch\u00fcler|Meistersch\u00fcler]] degree in fine arts at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] in 1986.\n\n== Career ==\nScrima has received numerous awards for her artistic work, including the [[:de:Kunsthalle Lingen|Lingener Kunstpreis]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kunsthallelingen.de/1996-andrea-scrima/|title=Kunstpreis 1996: Andrea Scrima \u2013 Kunsthalle Lingen|website=www.kunsthallelingen.de|language=de-DE|access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref> and a grant from the [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]].

[[Kate Christensen]] writes: \"Scrima paints vivid, detailed memories of places to evoke a web of intimate relationships that emerges gradually from a temporal fog into shocking, unforgettable clarity\", while [[Robert Goolrick]] calls ''A Lesser Day'' \"a monument to the human struggle to survive, to remember, to understand, and to love\".

He was most famous for his campaign in the [[Indian Ocean]], in which he fought a series of intense and evenly matched battles for [[Command of the sea|supremacy]] against the established British power there, led by Vice-Admiral Sir [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Edward Hughes]]. [[Alfred T.

During the battle, ''Solide'' engaged [[HMS Northumberland (1705)|HMS ''Northumberland'']]. <ref name=cunat9>Cunat, p.9</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1745, Suffren transferred on ''Pauline'', part of a 5-ship and 2-frigate squadron under Captain [[Jean-Baptiste Mac Nemara]],{{refn|Alternatively spelt \"Macn\u00e9mara\", \"Macnemara\"<ref name=cunat10 /> or \"Macnamara\"|group=Note}} sent to America to harasse British forces.<ref name=cunat10>Cunat, p.10</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}. At his return, Suffren served on the 60-gun [[French ship Trident (1742)|''Trident'']], under Captain d'Estourmel, and took part in [[Duc d'Anville expedition]].<ref name=cunat11>Cunat, p.11</ref>\n\nSuffren graduated from the Gardes-Marine in 1747 as an Ensign,<ref name=hennequin289 /> and worked on commissioning the brand new [[74-gun]] [[HMS Monarch (1747)|''Monarque'']], under Captain de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re.<ref name=cunat12>Cunat, p.12</ref> He took part in the [[Second Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747)|Second Battle of Cape Finisterre]] on 25 October 1747, where La B\u00e9doy\u00e8re was killed and ''Monarque'', badly damaged, was captured.<ref name=cunat15>Cunat, p.15</ref> Suffren was taken prisoner.<ref name=cunat18>Cunat, p.18</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] restoring peace, Suffren joined the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Malta]].<ref name=cunat19>Cunat, p.19</ref> He served in several commercial expeditions <ref name=hennequin290>Hennequin, p.290</ref> on galleys of the Order, escorting merchantmen and defending them against the depredation of the [[Barbary pirates|Barbary corsairs]].  In late 1754, Suffren departed Malta to return to Toulon.<ref name=cunat19 />\n\n===Seven Years' War===\n{{further|France in the Seven Years War}}\nIn 1756, Suffren had returned to Toulon and had risen to [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]]. At the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]], Suffren was appointed to the 64-gun [[French ship Orph\u00e9e (1750)|''Orph\u00e9e'']], part of a 12-ship squadron under [[Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissoni\u00e8re|La Galissoni\u00e8re]] tasked with ferrying 12,000 men under [[Armand de Vignerot du Plessis|Mar\u00e9chal de Richelieu]] to strike [[Menorca]]. The squadron departed on 10 April, arriving on 17 and landing troops; the British garrison retreated to [[St. Philip's Castle]] and was forced to surrender after the [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|Siege of Fort St Philip]].<ref name=cunat25>Cunat, p.25</ref> Patrolling between [[Menorca]] and [[Mallorca]] to prevent British relief to support Fort St. Philip, La Galissoni\u00e8re intercepted a 13-ship squadron under [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]], leading to the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca]]. The British failed to break the French blockade, and Fort St. Philip fell on 29 July.<ref name=cunat26>Cunat, p.26</ref>\n\nIn 1757, Suffren transferred to the 80-gun [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1756)|''Oc\u00e9an'']], flagship of a 6-ship and 2-frigate squadron under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]]. The squadron departed Toulon in November, bound for Brest. On 7 December, it called [[Cartagena]] to resupply, and found itself blockaded by a British from under [[Henry Osborne]]. <ref name=cunat26 /> A relief squadron under [[Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville|Duquesne de Menneville]] attempted to break the blockade, but was destroyed in the [[Battle of Cartagena (1758)|Battle of Cartagena]], as La Clue failed to [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]]. Suffren witnessed the capture of [[HMS Foudroyant (1758)|''Foudroyant'']] and ''Orph\u00e9e'' on 28 February 1758. La Clue's squadron eventually returned to Toulon.<ref name=cunat27>Cunat, p.27</ref>\n\nToulon was blockaded by [[Edward Boscawen]]'s forces but, on 16 August 1758, La Clue seized an opportunity to make a sortie with 12 ships and 3 frigates. The frigate [[HMS Gibraltar (1754)|HMS ''Gibraltar'']] detected La Clue's squadron and reported to Boscawen, who moved to intercept.<ref name=cunat29>Cunat, p.29</ref> Meanwhile, the French squadron failed to maintain formation and scattered.<ref name=cunat30>Cunat, p.30</ref> In the ensuing [[Battle of Lagos]], ''Oc\u00e9an'' ran aground in Almadora Bay and was burnt by the British, while her crew was taken prisoner, including Suffren.<ref name=cunat31>Cunat, p.31</ref> He returned to France after several months and was left without employ at sea for several years.<ref name=cunat32>Cunat, p.32</ref>\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nOn the return of peace in 1763 Suffren intended again to do the service in the caravans which was required to qualify him to hold the high and lucrative posts of the Order. He was, however, named to the command of the 20-gun [[xebec]] ''Cam\u00e9l\u00e9on'',<ref name=cunat32 /> which he cruised against the [[Barbary pirates]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Shortly thereafter, he transferred on ''Singe'', also a 20-gun xebec, part of a squadron under [[Louis Charles du Chaffault de Besn\u00e9]]. He took part in the [[Larache expedition]].<ref name=cunat32 /> In 1767, Suffren was promoted to [[frigate captain]] and called to Brest to serve on the 64-gun [[French ship Union (1763)|''Union'']], flagship of a squadron headed by [[Pierre-Claude Haudeneau de Breugnon]].<ref name=cunat33>Cunat, p.33</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the expedition, Suffren returned to Malta to resume escort duty with the Order. He spent four years, rising from Knight to Commander. In February 1772, he was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in the French Navy, and returned to Toulon to take command of the 26-gun frigate [[French frigate Mignonne (1767)|''Mignonne'']]. He conducted two patrols in the Eastern Mediterranean. <ref name=cunat33 />\n\nIn 1776, [[Louis Charles du Chaffault de Besn\u00e9|Duchaffault]] appointed Suffren to the command of the 26-gun frigate [[French frigate Alcm\u00e8ne (1774)|''Alcm\u00e8ne'']]. She departed for a training cruise to drill new navy officers. <ref name=cunat33 />  From that time till the beginning of the [[War of American Independence]] he commanded vessels in the squadron of evolution which the French government had established for the purpose of training its officers. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n\n===Operations against the British, 1770s\u20131780s===\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance}}\nIn 1778 and 1779, Suffren formed part of the squadron of Vice-Amiral \u00e8s Mers d'Asie et d'Amerique [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|D'Estaing]] throughout its operations on the coast of [[North America]] and in the [[West Indies]]. He led the line in the [[Battle of Grenada|action]] with [[John Byron|Admiral John Byron]] off [[Grenada]], and his ship, ''Fantasque'' (64), lost 62 men. His letters to his admiral show that he strongly disapproved of D'Estaing's half-hearted methods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1780, he was captain of {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} (74), in the combined French and Spanish fleets which [[Action of 9 August 1780|captured a great English]] convoy in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. His candour towards his chief, [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], had done him no harm in the opinion of D'Estaing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt is said to have been largely by the advice of this admiral that Suffren was chosen to command a squadron of five ships of the line sent out to help the Dutch who had joined France and Spain to defend the Cape against an expected English attack, and then to go on to the East Indies. He sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on March 22. On April 16, 1781 he found the English expedition on its way to the Cape under the command of Commodore, commonly called Governor, [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]] (1730\u20131787), at anchor in [[Porto Praya]], [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Remembering how little respect Boscawen had shown for the neutrality of [[Portugal]] at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]], he attacked at once, in the [[Battle of Porto Praya]]. No serious losses were sustained by either side. Suffren pushed on to the Cape, which he saved from capture by Johnstone, and then made his way to the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), then held by the French. M. D'Orves, his superior officer, died as the united squadrons, now eleven sail of the line, were on their way to the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

He was most famous for his campaign in the [[Indian Ocean]], in which he fought a series of intense and evenly matched battles for [[Command of the sea|supremacy]] against the established British power there, led by Vice-Admiral Sir [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Edward Hughes]]. [[Alfred T.

During the battle, ''Solide'' engaged [[HMS Northumberland (1705)|HMS ''Northumberland'']]. <ref name=cunat9>Cunat, p.9</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1745, Suffren transferred on ''Pauline'', part of a 5-ship and 2-frigate squadron under Captain [[Jean-Baptiste Mac Nemara]],{{refn|Alternatively spelt \"Macn\u00e9mara\", \"Macnemara\"<ref name=cunat10 /> or \"Macnamara\"|group=Note}} sent to America to harasse British forces.<ref name=cunat10>Cunat, p.10</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}. At his return, Suffren served on the 60-gun [[French ship Trident (1742)|''Trident'']], under Captain d'Estourmel, and took part in [[Duc d'Anville expedition]].<ref name=cunat11>Cunat, p.11</ref>\n\nSuffren graduated from the Gardes-Marine in 1747 as an Ensign,<ref name=hennequin289 /> and worked on commissioning the brand new [[74-gun]] [[HMS Monarch (1747)|''Monarque'']], under Captain de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re.<ref name=cunat12>Cunat, p.12</ref> He took part in the [[Second Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747)|Second Battle of Cape Finisterre]] on 25 October 1747, where La B\u00e9doy\u00e8re was killed and ''Monarque'', badly damaged, was captured.<ref name=cunat15>Cunat, p.15</ref> Suffren was taken prisoner.<ref name=cunat18>Cunat, p.18</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] restoring peace, Suffren joined the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Malta]].<ref name=cunat19>Cunat, p.19</ref> He served in several commercial expeditions <ref name=hennequin290>Hennequin, p.290</ref> on galleys of the Order, escorting merchantmen and defending them against the depredation of the [[Barbary pirates|Barbary corsairs]].  In late 1754, Suffren departed Malta to return to Toulon.<ref name=cunat19 />\n\n===Seven Years' War===\n{{further|France in the Seven Years War}}\nIn 1756, Suffren had returned to Toulon and had risen to [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]]. At the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]], Suffren was appointed to the 64-gun [[French ship Orph\u00e9e (1750)|''Orph\u00e9e'']], part of a 12-ship squadron under [[Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissoni\u00e8re|La Galissoni\u00e8re]] tasked with ferrying 12,000 men under [[Armand de Vignerot du Plessis|Mar\u00e9chal de Richelieu]] to strike [[Menorca]]. The squadron departed on 10 April, arriving on 17 and landing troops; the British garrison retreated to [[St. Philip's Castle]] and was forced to surrender after the [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|Siege of Fort St Philip]].<ref name=cunat25>Cunat, p.25</ref> Patrolling between [[Menorca]] and [[Mallorca]] to prevent British relief to support Fort St. Philip, La Galissoni\u00e8re intercepted a 13-ship squadron under [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]], leading to the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca]]. The British failed to break the French blockade, and Fort St. Philip fell on 29 July.<ref name=cunat26>Cunat, p.26</ref>\n\nIn 1757, Suffren transferred to the 80-gun [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1756)|''Oc\u00e9an'']], flagship of a 6-ship and 2-frigate squadron under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]]. The squadron departed Toulon in November, bound for Brest. On 7 December, it called [[Cartagena]] to resupply, and found itself blockaded by a British from under [[Henry Osborne]]. <ref name=cunat26 /> A relief squadron under [[Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville|Duquesne de Menneville]] attempted to break the blockade, but was destroyed in the [[Battle of Cartagena (1758)|Battle of Cartagena]], as La Clue failed to [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]]. Suffren witnessed the capture of [[HMS Foudroyant (1758)|''Foudroyant'']] and ''Orph\u00e9e'' on 28 February 1758. La Clue's squadron eventually returned to Toulon.<ref name=cunat27>Cunat, p.27</ref>\n\nToulon was blockaded by [[Edward Boscawen]]'s forces but, on 16 August 1758, La Clue seized an opportunity to make a sortie with 12 ships and 3 frigates. The frigate [[HMS Gibraltar (1754)|HMS ''Gibraltar'']] detected La Clue's squadron and reported to Boscawen, who moved to intercept.<ref name=cunat29>Cunat, p.29</ref> Meanwhile, the French squadron failed to maintain formation and scattered.<ref name=cunat30>Cunat, p.30</ref> In the ensuing [[Battle of Lagos]], ''Oc\u00e9an'' ran aground in Almadora Bay and was burnt by the British, while her crew was taken prisoner, including Suffren.<ref name=cunat31>Cunat, p.31</ref> He returned to France after several months and was left without employ at sea for several years.<ref name=cunat32>Cunat, p.32</ref>\n\n=== Interwar period ==\nOn the return of peace in 1763 Suffren intended again to do the service in the caravans which was required to qualify him to hold the high and lucrative posts of the Order. He was, however, named to the command of the 20-gun [[xebec]] ''Cam\u00e9l\u00e9on'',<ref name=cunat32 /> which he cruised against the [[Barbary pirates]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Shortly thereafter, he transferred on ''Singe'', also a 20-gun xebec, part of a squadron under [[Louis Charles du Chaffault de Besn\u00e9]]. He took part in the [[Larache expedition]].<ref name=cunat32 /> In 1767, Suffren was promoted to [[frigate captain]] and called to Brest to serve on the 64-gun [[French ship Union (1763)|''Union'']], flagship of a squadron headed by [[Pierre-Claude Haudeneau de Breugnon]].<ref name=cunat33>Cunat, p.33</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the expedition, Suffren returned to Malta to resume escort duty with the Order. He spent four years, rising from Knight to Commander. In February 1772, he was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in the French Navy, and returned to Toulon to take command of the 26-gun frigate [[French frigate Mignonne (1767)|''Mignonne'']]. He conducted two patrols in the Eastern Mediterranean. <ref name=cunat33 />\n\nIn 1776, [[Louis Charles du Chaffault de Besn\u00e9|Duchaffault]] appointed Suffren to the command of the 26-gun frigate [[French frigate Alcm\u00e8ne (1774)|''Alcm\u00e8ne'']]. She departed for a training cruise to drill new navy officers. <ref name=cunat33 />  From that time till the beginning of the [[War of American Independence]] he commanded vessels in the squadron of evolution which the French government had established for the purpose of giving practice to its officers. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n\n===Operations against the British, 1770s\u20131780s===\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance}}\nIn 1778 and 1779, Suffren formed part of the squadron of Vice-Amiral \u00e8s Mers d'Asie et d'Amerique [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|D'Estaing]] throughout its operations on the coast of [[North America]] and in the [[West Indies]]. He led the line in the [[Battle of Grenada|action]] with [[John Byron|Admiral John Byron]] off [[Grenada]], and his ship, ''Fantasque'' (64), lost 62 men. His letters to his admiral show that he strongly disapproved of D'Estaing's half-hearted methods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1780, he was captain of {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} (74), in the combined French and Spanish fleets which [[Action of 9 August 1780|captured a great English]] convoy in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. His candour towards his chief, [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], had done him no harm in the opinion of D'Estaing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt is said to have been largely by the advice of this admiral that Suffren was chosen to command a squadron of five ships of the line sent out to help the Dutch who had joined France and Spain to defend the Cape against an expected English attack, and then to go on to the East Indies. He sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on March 22. On April 16, 1781 he found the English expedition on its way to the Cape under the command of Commodore, commonly called Governor, [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]] (1730\u20131787), at anchor in [[Porto Praya]], [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Remembering how little respect Boscawen had shown for the neutrality of [[Portugal]] at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]], he attacked at once, in the [[Battle of Porto Praya]]. No serious losses were sustained by either side. Suffren pushed on to the Cape, which he saved from capture by Johnstone, and then made his way to the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), then held by the French. M. D'Orves, his superior officer, died as the united squadrons, now eleven sail of the line, were on their way to the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

In turn, there are a few factors that are likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism.\n\n*''[[Democracy]]'': Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C.

To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandals.\n*''News beats'': The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization.

The detached watchdog journalism is predominant especially in the western countries such as Germany, the United States, Austria, and Switzerland.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn the detached approach, the most predominant form of watchdog journalism, criticism and question which are done by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny.

As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism  ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered.

In turn, there are a few factors that are likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism.\n\n*''[[Democracy]]'': Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C.

To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandals.\n*''News beats'': The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization.

It involved [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation.

As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism  ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies.

Paden, Muslim Civic Cultures and Conflict Resolution: the challenge of democratic federalism in Nigeria, Brookings Institution Press, 2005. p 60. {{ISBN|0-8157-6817-6}}</ref> He was a close associate of [[Ahmadu Bello]], the premier of the Northern region in the 1950s and 1960s and became the Grand Khadi in 1967, the position was abolished.\n\nGumi emerged as a vocal leader during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] era, where he felt the practice of [[indirect rule]] had weakened the religious power of [[Emir]]s and encouraged [[westernization]]. Beginning in the 1960s, public conflicts emerged between him and leaders of the [[Sufi]] brotherhood, some of whom he later debated on television programs in the 1970s and 1980s. By that time, he had managed to keep his ideas in the spotlight by holding Friday talking sessions inside the [[Kaduna]] Central [[Mosque]] ([[Sultan Bello Mosque]]). He used the sessions to revive his criticism of established authorities based on his views of a back to the source approach or the need to embrace a puritanical practice of Islam. He also criticized harshly the involvement of [[mysticism]] and the resulting [[Syncreticism|syncreticized]] practice of the Sufis.\n\nhe has an unclear number of children, however his first born and must popular child happens to be Dr [[Ahmad Abubakar Gumi]] who succeeded his father as the scholar of the central mosque Kaduna (Sultan Bello), Dr Ahmad Gumi is a certified medical doctor from [[Ahmadu Bello University]] Zaria and was a former military officer, he left the military and travel to study fiqh (''[[Islamic jurisprudence]]'') at the [[umm Al-Qura University]] in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]]  where he obtained his PhD.\n\nAbubakar Gumi has proven not to have anything to do with the present Nigerian sunni movement of Boko haram because of his strong support for democracy, civil law and western education since his early years as a teacher, he's often quoted to have said, \"during election, voting is more necessary than to pray\".\n\nGumi is a follower of the [[Maliki|Maliki school]] of thought, this was derived through his writings including his Qur'anic tafsir (''Raddul azhaan ila ma'anil kur'an'')\n\nand other books like (''hullu nizam ala nuzuul isa'').{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nGumi was born in the village of Gummi now a local government area in Zamfara state on the last Friday of Ramadan in the Islamic year 1344, to the family of Mahmud, an Islamic scholar and Alkali (judge) of Gummi. His education started within the walls of his family when he was a pupil of his father's Islamic teachings. He later sent to a school under the tutelage of a Malam called Musa at Ambursa, [[Sokoto]] province. There he was introduced to [[Fiqh]] and read books and praise poems on the prophet. The first secular school he attended was the Dogondaji Primary School, while in the primary school, he met the future 18th Sultan of Sokoto, [[Ibrahim Dasuki]] and excelled in religious duties. He was made Hakimin Salla (leader of prayer) and was delegated responsibility for catering to the students religious activities. Within a year, he was transferred to the Sokoto [[Middle School]], where Ahamdu Bello was teaching, there he was acquainted with [[Shehu Shagari]], Waziri [[Muhammadu Junaidu]], and Yahaya Gusau, the latter was a co-founder of Jamaat nasr al-Islam, a prominent [[Nigerian]] [[Muslim]] organization.\n\nAfter completing his studies at the middle school, he went to [[Kano]] to study Law and was trained as a [[Qadi]]. He started work as a scribe to Qadi Attahiru but he soon became disenchanted with the specifics of his job. He gave private lessons on Islam and [[tafsir]] as an escape from his disenchantment. He lost his father in 1937 while he was at the middle school. He got married 3 years later to maryam in 1941 when he was just 19.\n\n===Early career===\nIn 1947, Abubakar Gumi, left his job as secretary to Qadi Attahiru and went to teach at the Kano Law School, which he had previously attended. While in Kano, he met Sheik Sa'id Hayatu, a man widely considered one of the most prominent victims of colonial rule. Hayatu was the leader of the Mahdiyya movement and had just returned from a forced sojourn in [[Cameroon]]. Abubakar became enthralled with the teachings of the movement and briefly became a follower of the Mahdiyya movement; he later married Hayatu's daughter, Maryam. However, she died after giving birth to a son. Abubakar Gumi first son wasn't Ahmad Abubakar, but, Dr Hamza Abubakar a medical Doctor currently practicing in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, followed by Maj. Gen. Abdulkadir Abubakar rtd. & two other elder sisters married to late Justice Muhammadu Bello former chief justice of the federation, and other married to Sheik Sunusi Gumbi a well known Islamic scholar and student to Abubakar Gumi.\n\nIn 1949, he took a teaching job at a school in Maru, Sokoto. The school had a famous tutor, [[Aminu Kano]], who was the co-founder of the Northern Teachers Association and proprietor of a few [[Muslim school]]s.

Gumi's fears about the movement were later fomented by the organizational skills of the Nigerian founder, the movement gradually became involved in the Western Nigerian [[pilgrimage]] board and had established schools for pupils in the South and was moving up north in his dissemination of the principles of the Ahmadis. Gumi took on the challenge easily and the movement's northward agenda was curtailed.\n\n==Mass media approach ==\nSheik Gumi made his first pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in 1955 and was joined in the journey by Ahmadu Bello. While in Mecca, he translated Islamic works in the company of Bello and King Sa'ud. He also met and befriended many members of the Ummah or Muslim community in Saudi Arabia, many of whom later became his benefactors after the death of Ahmadu Bello in 1966. On returning to Nigeria, he began to teach at the School of Arabic Studies in Kano and also at some Muslim schools founded by the [[Jama'atu Nasril Islam]]<!--[[Jammat nasr al-Islam]]--> (JNI) which were situated near the [[metropolis]] of Kaduna. A large part of his teachings focused on the differences between tradition and Religion, and how to understand and embrace an Islamic identity. He also wrote interpretations of the [[Qur'an]], mostly based on the [[Sunnah|Sunna]] and translated the Qur'an from [[Arabic]] to [[Hausa language|Hausa]].

He felt the new administration had the political power to curtail his views, and in the process, he resulted to consult his friends in Saudi Arabia for moral, dogmatic and financial support to promote a [[Wahhabi movement|Wahabbist]] interpretation of Islam centering on the rejection of mysticism, return to [[Athari|puritanical]] Islamic teaching and rejection of the then dominant Sufi brotherhoods. He also wanted to find mass support in his battle with the brotherhood and what he felt was their hold on the political process. Gumi, became more interested in ensuring political support for his ideas, based on his perception that a political Muslim has the power to change the course of lives of a larger number of people than publishing scholarly works or engaging in private debates and gradually became more interested in political means to achieve an Islamic reformist end. In the process, he became a supporter of [[women's rights]] to vote. By the early 1970s, to contest what he felt was the hijacking of major Islamic political organizations by the Fityan al-Islam, an organization founded in Kano by Mudi Salga, a leader of the Salgawa network and who was opposed to some of the policies of the late Ahmadu Bello and his Jamaat nasr al-Islam (the Association for the support of Islam). He decided to start a movement and relied on his old students to spread his views on Islamic dogma,<ref>Lomeier p 209</ref> prodding many to take jobs at the JNI and enter into legislative duties. He used his students as a foundation for the new movement to challenge the Sufi brotherhoods and ensure a return of Islam to a fundamental way. The rise of this movement ''[[Izala Society|Izalatul Bidi'a Wa Ikamatul Sunnah]]'' or ''Movement for the Rivival of the Sunnah'', popularly called Izala, heralded the [[Islamic Extremism in Northern Nigeria|radicalization of Northern Nigeria]].\n\nMany within the political cycles and Sufi Brotherhoods of [[Northern Nigeria]] held that Gumi was the principle that drove a wedge between Muslims and non Muslims in Northern Nigeria, his interpretations of the [[Hadith]] and Qur'an were based on his own personal views and not the Sunnah, and that he was monopolizing the [[mass media]] for his personal views.

Beginning in the 1960s, public conflicts emerged between him and leaders of the [[Sufi]] brotherhood, some of whom he later debated on television programs in the 1970s and 1980s. By that time, he had managed to keep his ideas in the spotlight by holding Friday talking sessions inside the [[Kaduna]] Central [[Mosque]] ([[Sultan Bello Mosque]]). He used the sessions to revive his criticism of established authorities based on his views of a back to the source approach or the need to embrace a puritanical practice of Islam. He also criticized harshly the involvement of [[mysticism]] and the resulting [[Syncreticism|syncreticized]] practice of the Sufis.\n\nhe has an unclear number of children, however his first born and must popular child happens to be Dr [[Ahmad Abubakar Gumi]] who succeeded his father as the scholar of the central mosque Kaduna (Sultan Bello), Dr Ahmad Gumi is a certified medical doctor from [[Ahmadu Bello University]] Zaria and was a former military officer, he left the military and travel to study fiqh (''[[Islamic jurisprudence]]'') at the [[umm Al-Qura University]] in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]]  where he obtained his PhD.\n\nAbubakar Gumi has proven not to have anything to do with the present Nigerian sunni movement of Boko haram because of his strong support for democracy, civil law and western education since his early years as a teacher, he's often quoted to have said, \"during election, voting is more necessary than to pray\".\n\nGumi is a follower of the [[Maliki|Maliki school]] of thought, this was derived through his writings including his Qur'anic tafsir (''Raddul azhaan ila ma'anil kur'an'')\n\nand other books like (''hullu nizam ala nuzuul isa'').{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nGumi was born in the village of Gummi now a local government area in Zamfara state on the last Friday of Ramadan in the Islamic year 1344, to the family of Mahmud, an Islamic scholar and Alkali (judge) of Gummi. His education started within the walls of his family when he was a pupil of his father's Islamic teachings. He later sent to a school under the tutelage of a Malam called Musa at Ambursa, [[Sokoto]] province. There he was introduced to [[Fiqh]] and read books and praise poems on the prophet. The first secular school he attended was the Dogondaji Primary School, while in the primary school, he met the future 18th Sultan of Sokoto, [[Ibrahim Dasuki]] and excelled in religious duties. He was made Hakimin Salla (leader of prayer) and was delegated responsibility for catering to the students religious activities. Within a year, he was transferred to the Sokoto [[Middle School]], where Ahamdu Bello was teaching, there he was acquainted with [[Shehu Shagari]], Waziri [[Muhammadu Junaidu]], and Yahaya Gusau, the latter was a co-founder of Jamaat nasr al-Islam, a prominent [[Nigerian]] [[Muslim]] organization.\n\nAfter completing his studies at the middle school, he went to [[Kano]] to study Law and was trained as a [[Qadi]]. He started work as a scribe to Qadi Attahiru but he soon became disenchanted with the specifics of his job. He gave private lessons on Islam and [[tafsir]] as an escape from his disenchantment. He lost his father in 1937 while he was at the middle school. He got married 3 years later to maryam in 1941 when he was just 19.\n\n===Early career===\nIn 1947, Abubakar Gumi, left his job as secretary to Qadi Attahiru and went to teach at the Kano Law School, which he had previously attended. While in Kano, he met Sheik Sa'id Hayatu, a man widely considered one of the most prominent victims of colonial rule. Hayatu was the leader of the Mahdiyya movement and had just returned from a forced sojourn in [[Cameroon]]. Abubakar became enthralled with the teachings of the movement and briefly became a follower of the Mahdiyya movement; he later married Hayatu's daughter, Maryam. However, she died after giving birth to a son. Abubakar Gumi first son wasn't Ahmad Abubakar, but, Dr Hamza Abubakar a medical Doctor currently practicing in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, followed by Maj. Gen. Abdulkadir Abubakar rtd. & two other elder sisters married to late Justice Muhammadu Bello former chief justice of the federation, and other married to Sheik Sunusi Gumbi a well known Islamic scholar and student to Abubakar Gumi.\n\nIn 1949, he took a teaching job at a school in Maru, Sokoto. The school had a famous tutor, [[Aminu Kano]], who was the co-founder of the Northern Teachers Association and proprietor of a few [[Muslim school]]s. Aminu and Gumi mingled and shared views on the influence of the traditional society with the Islamic faith and also the indifference or support given to the situation of [[Bida]] or syncretism by the Sufi brotherhoods.<ref>Lomeier p 48-50.</ref>\n\nHe left Maru to further his education at the school of Arabic Studies in Kano.

He launched the site to compare urban slang used by university students in different parts of California.

Peckham continued as the site's sole employee and maintained that he was not interested in venture funding or an [[Initial Public Offering]] (IPO) : \"It is weird to be in Silicon Valley and want to be independent and not be on track to IPO or want an acquisition ...

As such, \"to define\" a word or phrase on Urban Dictionary does not necessarily entail providing a strict definition; merely a description of some aspect of the word or phrase could suffice for inclusion in the dictionary.\n\nOriginally, Urban Dictionary was intended as a dictionary of [[slang dictionary|slang, or cultural words or phrases]], not typically found in standard dictionaries, but it is now used to define any word or phrase. Words or phrases on Urban Dictionary may have multiple definitions, usage examples, and [[tag (metadata)|tags]]. Some examples include, but are not limited to, \"Angry Hitler\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = angry hitler|url = http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=angry+hitler|website = Urban Dictionary|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}</ref> and \"Russian Candy Cane.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title = russian candy cane|url = http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=russian+candy+cane|website = Urban Dictionary|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\nVisitors to Urban Dictionary may submit definitions without registering, but they must provide a valid email address.\n\n=== Quality control ===\nBy default, each definition is accepted or rejected based on the number of \"Publish\" or \"Don't Publish\" votes it receives from volunteer editors. The editors are not bound by any criteria for the approval or rejection of definitions. Editors previously needed a valid email address, but it is no longer required, as three options are provided for new words: \"Add It!,\" \"Keep Out!,\" and \"I Can't Decide.\" However, a [[Facebook]] or [[Gmail]] account is required to post a new definition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Approve new words - 1. Should this be in Urban Dictionary?|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/game.php|website=Urban Dictionary|publisher=Urban Dictionary|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=31 January 2015}}</ref> Editors are not allowed to edit entries for spelling, wording or punctuation.\n\n=== Issues with content ===\nOne objection about content is that the very name \"Urban Dictionary\" misleadingly implies that urbanites in different cities share a common vocabulary. A more serious objection is that definitions can be trumped up for the sole purpose of embarrassing people.\n\nAlthough the explicit nature of many definitions on the site has led to objections, the site contains many non-explicit definitions. For example, the word \"massive\" is Jamaican in origin and is used to describe a group or collective. Peckham responded to the issue, stating that people may not be able to understand the meaning of such words without the aid of Urban Dictionary.\n\nUrban Dictionary has been criticized for hosting and failing to remove offensive submissions, including ones containing racist and sexist content.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chang |first1=Clio |title=Why Urban Dictionary Is Horrifically Racist |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/143704/urban-dictionary-horrifically-racist |website=The New Republic |date=15 July 2017}}</ref>  For example, the abundance of racist definitions of \"aboriginal\" prompted a petition calling for their removal on [[Change.org]] which received over 7,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lieu |first1=Johnny |title=Urban Dictionary deletes racist and offensive entries for 'aboriginal' following outrage |url=https://mashable.com/2018/02/08/urban-dictionary-racist-definitions/#ERu9UCpkdaqk |website=Mashable |date=2 February 2018}}</ref>  Many of such definitions were later purged.\n\nAnother objection that has arisen since 2018; several users have been noticing that a vast amount of their definitions have been getting deleted after approval. Users have had 20+ approved definitions and, after looking over their definitions in 3-4 weeks, noticed that Urban Dictionary has (without users consent) deleted a vast amount, leaving said users with one or two definitions in their personal definition list. Users have contacted Urban Dictionary Support via e-mail though have been left unanswered after providing their terminated definitions. The reasoning behind this is unknown.\n\n==Usage==\nAt the start of 2014, the dictionary had over seven million definitions, while 2,000 new entries were being added daily.<ref name=\"Jen\"/>\n\nIn November 2014, the Advertise page of the website stated that, on a monthly basis, Urban Dictionary averages 72 million impressions and 18 million unique readers.

For example, a man in Las Vegas was allowed to keep \"HOE\" as his license plate after managing to convince the state, with the use of Urban Dictionary, that it meant \"TAHOE\", as in [[Chevrolet Tahoe|the vehicle]] made by [[Chevrolet]], since that was already taken.<ref name=\"Praise\"/>\n\n[[IBM]] had programmed [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] to use Urban Dictionary.

Some examples include, but are not limited to, \"Angry Hitler\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = angry hitler|url = http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=angry+hitler|website = Urban Dictionary|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}</ref> and \"Russian Candy Cane.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title = russian candy cane|url = http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=russian+candy+cane|website = Urban Dictionary|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\nVisitors to Urban Dictionary may submit definitions without registering, but they must provide a valid email address.\n\n=== Quality control ===\nBy default, each definition is accepted or rejected based on the number of \"Publish\" or \"Don't Publish\" votes it receives from volunteer editors. The editors are not bound by any criteria for the approval or rejection of definitions. Editors previously needed a valid email address, but it is no longer required, as three options are provided for new words: \"Add It!,\" \"Keep Out!,\" and \"I Can't Decide.\" However, a [[Facebook]] or [[Gmail]] account is required to post a new definition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Approve new words - 1. Should this be in Urban Dictionary?|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/game.php|website=Urban Dictionary|publisher=Urban Dictionary|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=31 January 2015}}</ref> Editors are not allowed to edit entries for spelling, wording or punctuation.\n\n=== Issues with content ===\nOne objection about content is that the very name \"Urban Dictionary\" misleadingly implies that urbanites in different cities share a common vocabulary. A more serious objection is that definitions can be trumped up for the sole purpose of embarrassing people.\n\nAlthough the explicit nature of many definitions on the site has led to objections, the site contains many non-explicit definitions. For example, the word \"massive\" is Jamaican in origin and is used to describe a group or collective. Peckham responded to the issue, stating that people may not be able to understand the meaning of such words without the aid of Urban Dictionary.\n\nUrban Dictionary has been criticized for hosting and failing to remove offensive submissions, including ones containing racist and sexist content.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chang |first1=Clio |title=Why Urban Dictionary Is Horrifically Racist |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/143704/urban-dictionary-horrifically-racist |website=The New Republic |date=15 July 2017}}</ref>  For example, the abundance of racist definitions of \"aboriginal\" prompted a petition calling for their removal on [[Change.org]] which received over 7,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lieu |first1=Johnny |title=Urban Dictionary deletes racist and offensive entries for 'aboriginal' following outrage |url=https://mashable.com/2018/02/08/urban-dictionary-racist-definitions/#ERu9UCpkdaqk |website=Mashable |date=2 February 2018}}</ref>  Many of such definitions were later purged.\n\nAnother objection that has arisen since 2018; several users have been noticing that a vast amount of their definitions have been getting deleted after approval. Users have had 20+ approved definitions and, after looking over their definitions in 3-4 weeks, noticed that Urban Dictionary has (without users consent) deleted a vast amount, leaving said users with one or two definitions in their personal definition list. Users have contacted Urban Dictionary Support via e-mail though have been left unanswered after providing their terminated definitions. The reasoning behind this is unknown.\n\n==Usage==\nAt the start of 2014, the dictionary had over seven million definitions, while 2,000 new entries were being added daily.<ref name=\"Jen\"/>\n\nIn November 2014, the Advertise page of the website stated that, on a monthly basis, Urban Dictionary averages 72 million impressions and 18 million unique readers. According to Peckham in January 2014, just under 40% of the site's traffic is international, while the site's audience was predominantly male and aged between 15 and 24.<ref name=\"Jen\"/><ref name=\"Ham\"/>\n\nIn February 2019, the dictionary had over 1,500 words to define, while 4 new words were being added weekly.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferris |first1=Jackson |title=Urban Dictionary All Words |url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/yesterday.php?date=2019-02-19 |website=Urban Dictionary |accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Application ==\n===Legal cases===\nAs of 2013, Urban Dictionary has been used in several court cases to define slang terms not found in standard dictionaries. For example, the slang term \"jack\" was used to define the name the defendant used for his team, \"the jack boys.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Kaufman|first1=Leslie|title=For the Word on the Street, Courts Call Up an Online Witness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/business/media/urban-dictionary-finds-a-place-in-the-courtroom.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1|website=The New York Times|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref> Urban Dictionary was also used in a District Court complaint where a man posted a threat on a gun exchange Facebook page to \"murk that cocksucker\".<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":1\"/> The crowd-sourced dictionary was also used in a sexual harassment court case in Tennessee to define the phrase \"to nut\" as \"to [[ejaculate]]\".<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===Other===\nIn the United States, some state [[Departments of Motor Vehicles]] refer to Urban Dictionary in determining if certain license plates are appropriate or not. For example, a man in Las Vegas was allowed to keep \"HOE\" as his license plate after managing to convince the state, with the use of Urban Dictionary, that it meant \"TAHOE\", as in [[Chevrolet Tahoe|the vehicle]] made by [[Chevrolet]], since that was already taken.<ref name=\"Praise\"/>\n\n[[IBM]] had programmed [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] to use Urban Dictionary. After having all the words and definitions incorporated into Watson, it began responding to researchers' questions with profanity, leading the programmers to remove it from its memory and adding an additional filter to prevent it from swearing in the future.<ref>Matthew Humphries (10 January 2013).

Retrieved 25 August 2015.</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, The Malaca\u00f1ang Palace reacted to a definition referring to Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], defining him as deceptive, sly, fake and other words. Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the definitions of \"duterte\" are \"exact opposites\" of the traits of President Rodrigo Duterte, and said Duterte to them means \"honest, incorruptible, politically-willed person, courageous, selfless, honest, transparent and all good things...and other synonymous terms.\"\n\nLinguists continue to use Urban Dictionary for charting the development of slang terms, particularly those from the early 2000s before the advent of social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://daily.jstor.org/how-linguists-are-using-urban-dictionary/|title=How Linguists Are Using Urban Dictionary|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=2019-11-13|website=JSTOR Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Reference.com]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Peckham|first=Aaron|title=Urban dictionary: fularious street slang defined|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing, L.L.C|location=Kansas City, Missouri|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780740751431/page/320 320]|isbn=0-7407-5143-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780740751431/page/320}}\n* {{cite book|last=Peckham|first=Aaron|title=Mo' Urban Dictionary: Ridonkulous Street Slang Defined|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing, L.L.C|location=Kansas City, Missouri|year=2007|pages=240|isbn=0-7407-6875-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n{{Dictionaries of English}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Online English dictionaries]]\n[[Category:Slang dictionaries]]\n[[Category:American websites]]\n[[Category:Neologisms]]\n[[Category:Internet slang]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1999]]\n", "name_user": "79.68.123.11", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Dictionary"}

The group combines traditional [[Merengue t\u00edpico|merengue]] with elements of other genres such as [[House music|house]], [[Latin hip hop|hip hop]], and [[bachata (music)|bachata]] among others. With over five million albums sold throughout the world, they were at one time the top selling act in [[Colombia]], and were placed on other charts including those of [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]], and [[Chile]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Their name means \"Little John Doe\" (i.e. unknown) in Spanish (see ''[[wikt:Fulano|Fulano]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ito|-ito]]''). Members of Fulanito had previously been in popular groups such as [[740 Boyz]] and [[2 in a Room]].\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Album !! Year !!

Vargas grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in [[Manhattan, New York]], and Winston grew up in the [[South Bronx]].  They met in 1992 during a studio session where Winston was working as a recording engineer on one of Rafael\u2019s earlier projects.  Their first album, \u201cEl Hombre Mas Famoso De La Tierra\u201d gained international fame with the hit singles \u201cGuallando\u201d, \u201cEl Cepillo\u201d and \u201cLa Novela,. The album sold over 500,000 units worldwide.   They further gained international notoriety with their second album, \u201cEl Padrino\u201d which garnered them their first Grammy nomination.  Their third album, \u201cAmericanizao\u201d (2001) would be the last production both Vargas and Rosa would work on together.\n\n===Influences===\nFulanito\u2019s influences trace back to the early days of Tropical Latin music in New York. \u201cGrowing up in New York City during the late 70\u2019s,and 80\u2019s, our generation has been influenced by the sounds of classic dance music and Hip-hop, all while the classic tropical sounds waved through our ears\u201d states Vargas.  From their Latin roots, Vargas and Rosa were driven by the likes of [[Hector Lavoe]], [[Willie Col\u00f3n]], [[Johnny Pacheco]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Fernandito Villalona]].  Their more youthful roots go as far back as [[Run DMC]], [[T La Rock]], and [[LL Cool J]], among others.\n\n===2 in a Room===\nVargas began his quest in the music business when he first collaborated on a compilation project headed by Aldo Marin and his record label Cutting Records.  The compilation was to consist of various producers bring in their very own sounds in dance music.  Vargas and then partner, Roger Pauletta submitted a House/Hip-hop fused track \"Do What you Wanna Do\", the song gain notoriety in the underground House Music industry for its unique flow of Rap mixed in with a dance-friendly House beat. The song's popularity prompted Marin to suggest that Vargas collaborate his rap style on another single from the album.  Vargas would team up with DJ/producer George Morel on the international hit \"Wiggle It\".  With the immediate success of \"Wiggle It\", Vargas was eventually stapled as the frontman to the group ''2 in a Room'', releasing the album \"Wiggle It\" (Cutting/Charisma, 1990).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fraser Delgado|first=Celeste|title=What's in A Name|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2001-06-07/music/what-s-his-name/|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=June 7, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Vargas met Winston Rosa while Rosa was engineering one of his featured singles.  Having similar music styles and influences in common, they hit it off very well, eventually teaming up and forming their production company, WinDose International.  Following the success of \"Wiggle It\", Vargas was looking to bring in something new. With the help of Rosa, he released the album \"World Party\" (Cutting Records, 1994), which added the Latin element to his already popular House/Hip-Hop blend.  Vargas recruited his classmate Elvin Ovalles as his lyrical partner.  The first single on \"World Party\" was the Latin Urban club hit \"El Trago\", produced by the dance music DJ duo of Victor and Danny Vargas (No relation to Rafael)\n\n===740 Boyz===\nThe sound and popularity from \"World Party\" was the motivation that both Vargas and Rosa needed to build on a new sound in the ever changing Dance music circuit.  WIth the addition of Jose \"Pickles\" Fuentes, their friend and local club promoter and DJ from Vargas' neighborhood, they went on to form the [[740 Boyz]].  Their self-titled album was released in 1995, gaining a worldwide following with the international hit \"Shimmy Shake\".  The group gained greater popularity in Europe, specifically in France. 740 Boyz was the precursor to what defined the legacy of Fulanito, where Vargas first utilized his signature high-pitched chanted choruses and rap style.\n\n===El Hombre M\u00e1s Famoso de la Tierra (1997-1999)===\nAs the popularity of the 740 Boyz began to wind down, Vargas was once again in search of a new sound and market to exploit his talents.  With the growing success of many young urban Latin groups such as [[Proyecto Uno|Proyect Uno]], [[Ilegales]] and [[Sandy & Papo|Sandy y Papo]] surging in South America, Vargas and Rosa were eager to tap in.  Vargas was well aware of the rising success of the grassroots traditional merengue genre known as Perico Ripiao (Spanish for \"ripe parrot\"). Vargas found a way to keep his previous projects together by bringing Ovalles, Fuentes and adding Marino Paredes to the mix.  Rosa, being very close to the genre, enlisted the talents of his father, Arcenio De La Rosa, an accomplished well-known traditional merengue artist in his own right, to add to the authenticity of the sound.  They merged their hip hop styles with the sounds of merengue, as well as samba and cumbia, and released \"El Hombre Mas Famoso De La Tierra\" in 1997.  The album gained immediate worldwide recognition selling over 500,000 units.  The first single off the album, \"Guallando,\" became a household chant, gaining song of the year honors in Colombia in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ross|first = Karl|title = The Dominican Squeezebox Goes Digital|url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-04-06/music/the-dominican-squeezebox-goes-digital/|publisher = Miami New Times|accessdate = April 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===El Padrino (1999-2001)===\nFulanito's second studio album, \"El Padrino\" (Cutting, 1999) used many of the same elements that garnered them international fame, with only minor changes to the sound and the frontline.  Rosa decided to step down as one of the frontmen to concentrate on the production end.  Vargas would add Welington Belen to replace Rosa.  Belen, born and raised in the Dominican Republic and a student of merengue genre, was very instrumental in the production of \"El Padrino\". Vargas and Rosa were able to incorporate more of the authentic merengue sound while adding their American urban element with ease.  The album received a Grammy nomination in 1999, and had several songs featured in [[John Singleton|John Singelton]]'s modern day film release of [[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]].\n\n===Americanizao (2001-2004)===\nThe release of \"Americanizao\" (Cutting, 2001) saw the group becoming a quartet.  Belen left the group and Vargas would focus on a more urban dance feel for the album.  With its hit single \"Callate\", hip-hop tracks \"Otra Vez\" and \"Eight Million Ways\", the sound that Fulanito producing was making waves for a change, while still staying grounded in its merengue roots with \"Pecho A Pechuga\", \"La Tiembladera\" and \"El Generalissimo\", a song that created slight controversy in the Dominican Republic.  \"El Generalissimo\" was eventually prohibited from the nations airwaves just days after the album's release.  Officials cited the use of the title \"Generalissimo\" as a certain glorification to the country's last dictator, [[Rafael Trujillo]].\n\n===La Verdad (2004-2007)===\nIn 2004, Fulanito had a slight change in its front staff. Vargas would replace Ovalles and Paredes, and add Jesus Martinez and Daniel Fernandez to fill in.\n\n===Vacaner\u00eda! (2007-2009)===\nThe release of \"Vacaner\u00eda!\" saw the emergence of Rafael Vargas as he was solidifying his staple as a solo artist. Other artists and producers were invited to participate in the construction of the album to insure variety, depth and a breath of fresh air for Latin hip hop listeners everywhere. Music producers and brothers, Cristian Mendez and Cleyton Mendez, aka Guary & Cleyton, were among the contributors to the new album. The duo produced a salsa hip-hop track titled \"Pa Que Sepa\", properly utilizing a piece of the Roberto Ruena composition \"Que Se Sepa\", and also the track \"Mataron El Negro\", cleverly embodying a portion of the composition \"El Negron Bembon\", performed by legendary salsero [[Ismael Rivera]]. The first single release from the album was \"Mira\", which features vocals from Rhingo 'Truko' Fernandez. Truko is also featured alongside Magic Juan (former vocalist of the group Proyecto Uno) in the song \"Ajena\". \"No Hay Otro Como Yo\" features salsero [[Kevin Ceballo]] singing the hook in Spanglish. \"Sabado en La Noche\", a merengue-influenced reggaeton track, was produced by and features Tonny Tun Tun. Two other reggaeton songs on the album are the tracks \"Contigo\" and \"Sigue (Oh Oh)\". The Arabian-flavored club track \"Culebrita\" was produced by Rahdeekhal. In 2007, the album garnered Rafael his second Grammy Nomination in the best Latin Urban Urban Album category<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete List of Grammy  Nominees for 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/06grammylist.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Merengue music groups]]\n[[Category:American rappers of Dominican Republic descent]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American rappers]]\n", "text_old": "{{citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n{{POV|date=August 2012}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = Fulanito\n| image           = Fulanito En La Puerta Grande.jpg\n| image_size      = \n| landscape       = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = Fulanito En La Puerta Grande\n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = \"El Hombre M\u00e1s Famoso De La Tierra\"\n| origin          = [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]\n| genre           = {{flatlist|\n* [[Merengue music|Merengue]]\n* [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]\n* [[Dance music|dance]]\n* [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]\n}}\n| years_active    = 1996\u2013present\n| label           = {{flatlist|\n* Cutting Records (1997\u20132007)\n* Verdugo Entertainment (2008\u2013present)\n}}\n| associated_acts = {{flatlist|\n* [[740 Boyz]]\n* [[2 in a Room]]\n}}\n| current_members = \n* Winston Rosa (founder)\n* Rafael Vargas (founder)\n| past_members    = \n* Jos\u00e9 \"Pickles\" Fuentes (1997\u20132007)\n* Elvin Ovalles (1997\u20132002)\n* Marino Paredes (1997\u20132002)\n* Wellington Belen (1999\u20132000)\n* Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez (2003\u20132006)\n* Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez (2003\u20132005)\n}}\n\n'''Fulanito''' is an American musical group based in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in New York City.

The album gained immediate worldwide recognition selling over 500,000 units.  The first single off the album, \"Guallando,\" became a household chant, gaining song of the year honors in Colombia in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ross|first = Karl|title = The Dominican Squeezebox Goes Digital|url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-04-06/music/the-dominican-squeezebox-goes-digital/|publisher = Miami New Times|accessdate = April 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===El Padrino (1999-2001)===\nFulanito's second studio album, \"El Padrino\" (Cutting, 1999) used many of the same elements that garnered them international fame, with only minor changes to the sound and the frontline.  Rosa decided to step down as one of the frontmen to concentrate on the production end.  Vargas would add Welington Belen to replace Rosa.  Belen, born and raised in the Dominican Republic and a student of merengue genre, was very instrumental in the production of \"El Padrino\". Vargas and Rosa were able to incorporate more of the authentic merengue sound while adding their American urban element with ease.  The album received a Grammy nomination in 1999, and had several songs featured in [[John Singleton|John Singelton]]'s modern day film release of [[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]].\n\n===Americanizao (2001-2004)===\nThe release of \"Americanizao\" (Cutting, 2001) saw the group becoming a quartet.  Belen left the group and Vargas would focus on a more urban dance feel for the album.  With its hit single \"Callate\", hip-hop tracks \"Otra Vez\" and \"Eight Million Ways\", the sound that Fulanito producing was making waves for a change, while still staying grounded in its merengue roots with \"Pecho A Pechuga\", \"La Tiembladera\" and \"El Generalissimo\", a song that created slight controversy in the Dominican Republic.  \"El Generalissimo\" was eventually prohibited from the nations airwaves just days after the album's release.  Officials cited the use of the title \"Generalissimo\" as a certain glorification to the country's last dictator, [[Rafael Trujillo]].\n\n===La Verdad (2004-2007)===\nIn 2004, Fulanito had a slight change in its front staff. Vargas would replace Ovalles and Paredes, and add Jesus Martinez and Daniel Fernandez to fill in.\n\n===Vacaner\u00eda! (2007-2009)===\nThe release of \"Vacaner\u00eda!\" saw the emergence of Rafael Vargas as he was solidifying his staple as a solo artist. Other artists and producers were invited to participate in the construction of the album to insure variety, depth and a breath of fresh air for Latin hip hop listeners everywhere. Music producers and brothers, Cristian Mendez and Cleyton Mendez, aka Guary & Cleyton, were among one of the contributors to the new album. The duo produced a salsa hip-hop track titled \"Pa Que Sepa\", properly utilizing a piece of the Roberto Ruena composition \"Que Se Sepa\", and also the track \"Mataron El Negro\", cleverly embodying a portion of the composition \"El Negron Bembon\", performed by legendary salsero [[Ismael Rivera]]. The first single release from the album was \"Mira\", which features vocals from Rhingo 'Truko' Fernandez. Truko is also featured alongside Magic Juan (former vocalist of the group Proyecto Uno) in the song \"Ajena\". \"No Hay Otro Como Yo\" features salsero [[Kevin Ceballo]] singing the hook in Spanglish. \"Sabado en La Noche\", a merengue-influenced reggaeton track, was produced by and features Tonny Tun Tun. Two other reggaeton songs on the album are the tracks \"Contigo\" and \"Sigue (Oh Oh)\". The Arabian-flavored club track \"Culebrita\" was produced by Rahdeekhal. In 2007, the album garnered Rafael his second Grammy Nomination in the best Latin Urban Urban Album category<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete List of Grammy  Nominees for 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/06grammylist.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Merengue music groups]]\n[[Category:American rappers of Dominican Republic descent]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American rappers]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reword - you can't be \"among one\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulanito"}
