Paul Varisco, a musician who had come to Brian's studio and attended this session, offered her a job in his band called Paul Varisco & The Milestones,<ref name=\"fandalism.com\"/> a 9 piece R&B band from New Orleans including the late drummer \"Big\" Johnny Thomassie.\n\nShe left Texas in 1967 at age of 18 to join them.\n\nIn 1969, Judy and Johnny left the Milestones to join another R&B \"pop\" recording group called \"Eternity's Children\",<ref name=\"fandalism.com\"/> who had a record on the charts named \"Mrs. Bluebird\".\n\nThis band had several \"incarnations\" and Judy replaced Mike MacClain who was called up to do his military service.\n\nShe stayed with the group 9 months before returning to Texas with Dino Vera,<ref name=\"fandalism.com\"/> a drummer who she met in New Orleans during this time.

Experimenting with local songwriters and artists, the company began producing master recordings. Malaco needed to license their early recordings with established labels for national distribution. Between 1968 and 1970, [[Capitol Records]] released six singles and a [[Grammy Award]]-nominated album by [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]]. Revenue from record releases was minimal, however, and Malaco survived doing jingles, booking bands, promoting concerts, and renting the studio for custom projects.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nIn May 1970, a bespectacled producer-arranger changed the struggling company's fortune. [[Wardell Quezergue]] made his mark with [[New Orleans]] stalwarts [[Fats Domino]] and [[Professor Longhair]], among others. Quezergue offered to supply Malaco with artists in return for studio time and session musicians.<ref name=\"Source\"/> Quezergue brought five artists to Jackson in a borrowed school bus for a marathon session that yielded two hits \u2013 [[King Floyd]]'s \"[[Groove Me]]\" and [[Jean Knight]]'s \"[[Mr. Big Stuff]].\" But the tracks met rejection when submitted to [[Stax Records|Stax]] and [[Atlantic Records]] for distribution. Frustrated, Malaco released the King Floyd tracks on its own Chimneyville label. When \"Groove Me\" started radio play and sales, Atlantic picked the record up for distribution after all, giving Malaco a label deal for future Chimneyville product.<ref name=\"Source\"/> \"Groove Me\" entered the national charts in October, going to No. 1 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] and No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 1971, Chimneyville scored again with King Floyd's \"Baby Let Me Kiss You\" (No. 5 R&B and No. 29 Pop). Meanwhile, Stax decided to take a chance on \"Mr. Big Stuff\", selling over two million copies on the way to No. 1 on the R&B chart and No. 2 pop.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nMalaco's studio and [[session musician]]s were now in demand. Drummer [[James Stroud]], bassist Verne Robbins and guitarist Jerry Puckett were the nucleus of the Malaco Rhythm Section.  Atlantic sent the [[Pointer Sisters]] among others for the Malaco touch; Stax sent [[Rufus Thomas]] and others. In January 1973, [[Paul Simon]] recorded material for his ''[[There Goes Rhymin' Simon]]'' album. Later that year, Malaco released its first gospel record, \"Gospel Train\" by the Golden Nuggets on Atlantic's Cotillion label.  Also in 1973, King Floyd's \"Woman Don't Go Astray\" made No. 5 R&B.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nWhen Dorothy Moore recorded \"[[Misty Blue]]\" in 1973, Malaco got rejection slips trying to shop the master to other labels. Two years later, Malaco was just about broke and desperate for something to sell. With just enough cash to press and mail out the record, \"Misty Blue\" was released on the Malaco label just before [[Thanksgiving]].<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\n===Golden era: 1976\u20131985===\nDorothy Moore's \"Misty Blue\" earned gold records around the world, peaking at No. 2 R&B and No. 3 pop in the US, and No. 5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Source\"/> This was followed by thirteen chart records.  Moore got four Grammy Award nominations in her career. Other signings to the label included funk bands such as Freedom, Natural High, Power, and Sho-Nuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/ja/artist/227801-Sho-Nuff |title=Sho Nuff Discogs|website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-25}}</ref>\n\nAnother Malaco gamble in the late 1970s was targeting the gospel market again with the [[Jackson Southernaires]]. The gamble paid off, and other premium gospel artists signed on, including the [[Soul Stirrers]], [[The Sensational Nightingales]], [[The Williams Brothers (gospel group)|The Williams Brothers]], The Truthettes, Willie Banks and the Messengers and the [[Angelic Gospel Singers]]. The Southernaires's Frank Williams became Malaco's Director of Gospel Operations, producing virtually every Malaco gospel release until his death in 1993. By 1977, songwriters, artists, and producers from the defunct Stax Records were knocking on Malaco's doors, including [[Eddie Floyd]], [[Frederick Knight (singer)|Frederick Knight]], The Fiestas, and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]].<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nBy this time, Malaco had stopped trying to compete with mainstream labels. However, Malaco could make a tidy profit selling between 25,000 and 50,000 units.<ref name=\"Source\"/> Starting with [[Z. Z. Hill]], Malaco became the center for old-time blues and soul artists.  Hill released the single \"Cheating in the Next Room\", which reached R&B No. 19 in 1982.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/ZZ-Hill-Cheating-In-The-Next.../235 ]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref> Hill's album, ''Down Home Blues'', sold over 500,000 copies, before he suddenly died in 1984. Hearing [[Johnnie Taylor]] sing at the funeral service, Tommy Couch invited Taylor to become Malaco's new flagship artist.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\n[[Denise LaSalle]] charted fourteen times in the 1970s. After 29 chart entries for other labels, blues guitarist [[Little Milton]] signed with Malaco in 1984.<ref name=\"Source\"/> Little Milton's first Malaco single \"The Blues is Alright\" re-established his presence as a major blues artist and solidified Malaco's reputation as the contemporary southern blues company.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1985, Malaco signed [[Bobby Bland]]. He had notched up 62 ''Billboard'' R&B chart records in 25 years. \n\nIn 1985, the principals at Malaco, Tommy Couch, Wolf Stephenson and Stewart Madison bought [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studios]] which, by that time, was located at 1000 Alabama Avenue in Sheffield, Alabama.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\n===1986\u20132010===\nBobby Bland had a hit album, ''Midnight Run'', on the US soul album chart in 1989. Johnnie Taylor had his final hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] chart in 1990. In 1996, the label signed the Chicago-based soul singer, [[Tyrone Davis]] to the label, almost 30 years after his first major hit \"[[Can I Change My Mind]]\", an [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] No. 1.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nIn 2005, the owners decided to sell this studio because they were having difficulty keeping the studio booked.  The building was bought by a film and television production company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64002/historic-muscle-shoals-sound-studios-closes |title=Historic Muscle Shoals Sound Studios Closes  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=February 23, 2005 |website=Billboard.com|access-date=January 17, 2017 |quote=the last four years saw a sharp decline in outside projects.

Thousands of master tapes from recording sessions survived intact in a separate concrete vault. The company decided to re-build the damaged offices and recording studio on the same site and the new buildings were opened in the fall of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2012/jun/20/how-malaco-got-its-groove-back/ |title=How Malaco Got Its Groove Back |last=Lee |first=Garrad |date=June 20, 2012 |newspaper=[[Jackson Free Press]] |access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref> This storm came six years after [[Hurricane Katrina]] also hit the area, causing some damage to the Malaco premises.\n\n==Gospel==\nClearly the dominant contemporary southern blues label, Malaco purchased the gospel division of Savoy Records in 1986. Now, Malaco was also the preeminent black gospel company in North America. The Savoy acquisition brought a vast catalog of recordings, including albums by [[Shirley Caesar]], Rev. [[James Cleveland]], [[Albertina Walker]], [[The Caravans]], and [[Inez Andrews]]. In further expansion moves that year, Malaco entered the world of [[telemarketing]]. Malaco's gospel labels under Jerry Mannery, and Savoy Records under Milton Biggham, earned multiple honors, including Billboard designations as Top Gospel Label and Top Gospel Distributor, while the artists received numerous awards (Grammy, Stellar, Soul Train, and Gospel Music Workshop), as well as Billboard Top Gospel Artist of the Year designations.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The company also dominated Billboard Gospel charts, achieving No. 1 rankings by [[Keith Pringle]], [[Walter Hawkins]], Rev. James Moore, The [[Mississippi Mass Choir]], and [[Dorothy Norwood]].\n\n==Malaco Music Group==\nMalaco's market focus widened dramatically in 1995. Songwriter/producer Rich Cason cut \"Good Love\" with Johnnie Taylor. In 1996, Taylor's eighth album for Malaco, ''Good Love!'', reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Blues Albums]] chart (No. 15 R&B), and was the most commercially successful album in Malaco's history.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1997, Malaco was without a distribution deal and formed Malaco Music Group, which consists of Malaco Records and its subsidiaries. The company continued its steady, prudent expansion, purchasing half of the Memphis-based distributor [[Select-O-Hits]] and also making inroads into the [[urban contemporary]], [[jazz]], and contemporary [[Christian music|Christian]] markets.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nMalaco Records has been designated as a marker on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msbluestrail.org/blues_marker_list|title=List of Blues Trail Markers|website=Msbluestrail.org|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref> The company continue to release records in the 21st century.\n\n==Labels under Malaco==\n*[[Atlanta International Records]]\n*[[Savoy Records]]\n*[[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo Records]]\n*[[Shurfine Records]]\n*[[Juana Records]]\n*[[601 Records]]\n*[[Onyx Records]]\n\n==Artists==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Col-begin|width=90%}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Angelic Gospel Singers]]\n* [[Anita Ward]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeinmississippi.us/malaco-music-group/|title=Malaco Music Group|website=Madeinmississippi.us|accessdate=February 6, 2020}}</ref>\n*[[Blind Boys of Alabama]]\n*[[Bobby Bland]]<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n*[[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]]<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20294/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Bobby Rush |author=Ankeny, Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=February 21, 2020}}</ref> \n*[[Bryan Andrew Wilson]]\n*[[The Caravans]]\n*[[Clara Ward]] & The Famous Ward Singers\n* Clyde Bradley Singers\n*[[The Controllers (R&B band)|The Controllers]]\n*[[The Davis Sisters]]\n*[[Denise LaSalle]]\n* Dolores Barrett & Her Sisters\n*[[Dondria]]\n*[[Dorothy Moore]]<ref>Carpenter, Bil.

In 1971, Chimneyville scored again with King Floyd's \"Baby Let Me Kiss You\" (No. 5 R&B and No. 29 Pop). Meanwhile, Stax decided to take a chance on \"Mr. Big Stuff\", selling over two million copies on the way to No. 1 on the R&B chart and No. 2 pop.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nMalaco's studio and [[session musician]]s were now in demand. Drummer [[James Stroud]], bassist Verne Robbins and guitarist Jerry Puckett were the nucleus of the Malaco Rhythm Section.  Atlantic sent the [[Pointer Sisters]] among others for the Malaco touch; Stax sent [[Rufus Thomas]] and others. In January 1973, [[Paul Simon]] recorded material for his ''[[There Goes Rhymin' Simon]]'' album. Later that year, Malaco released its first gospel record, \"Gospel Train\" by the Golden Nuggets on Atlantic's Cotillion label.  Also in 1973, King Floyd's \"Woman Don't Go Astray\" made No. 5 R&B.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nWhen Dorothy Moore recorded \"[[Misty Blue]]\" in 1973, Malaco got rejection slips trying to shop the master to other labels. Two years later, Malaco was just about broke and desperate for something to sell. With just enough cash to press and mail out the record, \"Misty Blue\" was released on the Malaco label just before [[Thanksgiving]].<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\n===Golden era, 1976\u20131985===\nDorothy Moore's \"Misty Blue\" earned gold records around the world, peaking at No. 2 R&B and No. 3 pop in the US, and No. 5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Source\"/> This was followed by thirteen chart records.  Moore got four Grammy Award nominations in her career. Other signings to the label included funk bands such as Freedom, Natural High, Power, and Sho-Nuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/ja/artist/227801-Sho-Nuff |title=Sho Nuff Discogs|website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-25}}</ref>\n\nAnother Malaco gamble in the late 1970s was targeting the gospel market again with the [[Jackson Southernaires]]. The gamble paid off, and other premium gospel artists signed on, including the [[Soul Stirrers]], [[The Sensational Nightingales]], [[The Williams Brothers (gospel group)|The Williams Brothers]], The Truthettes, Willie Banks and the Messengers and the [[Angelic Gospel Singers]]. The Southernaires's Frank Williams became Malaco's Director of Gospel Operations, producing virtually every Malaco gospel release until his death in 1993. By 1977, songwriters, artists, and producers from the defunct Stax Records were knocking on Malaco's doors, including [[Eddie Floyd]], [[Frederick Knight (singer)|Frederick Knight]], The Fiestas, and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]].<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nBy this time, Malaco had stopped trying to compete with mainstream labels. However, Malaco could make a tidy profit selling between 25,000 and 50,000 units.<ref name=\"Source\"/> Starting with [[Z. Z. Hill]], Malaco became the center for old-time blues and soul artists.  Hill released the single \"Cheating in the Next Room\", which reached R&B No. 19 in 1982.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/ZZ-Hill-Cheating-In-The-Next.../235 ]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref> Hill's album, ''Down Home Blues'', sold over 500,000 copies, before he suddenly died in 1984. Hearing [[Johnnie Taylor]] sing at the funeral service, Tommy Couch invited Taylor to become Malaco's new flagship artist.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\n[[Denise LaSalle]] charted fourteen times in the 1970s. After 29 chart entries for other labels, blues guitarist [[Little Milton]] signed with Malaco in 1984.<ref name=\"Source\"/> Little Milton's first Malaco single \"The Blues is Alright\" re-established his presence as a major blues artist and solidified Malaco's reputation as the contemporary southern blues company.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1985, Malaco signed [[Bobby Bland]]. He had notched up 62 ''Billboard'' R&B chart records in 25 years. \n\nIn 1985, the principals at Malaco, Tommy Couch, Wolf Stephenson and Stewart Madison bought [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studios]] which, by that time, was located at 1000 Alabama Avenue in Sheffield, Alabama.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\n===1986\u20132010===\nBobby Bland had a hit album, ''Midnight Run'', on the US soul album chart in 1989. Johnnie Taylor had his final hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] chart in 1990. In 1996, the label signed the Chicago-based soul singer, [[Tyrone Davis]] to the label, almost 30 years after his first major hit \"[[Can I Change My Mind]]\", an [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] No. 1.<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n\nIn 2005, the owners decided to sell this studio because they were having difficulty keeping the studio booked.  The building was bought by a film and television production company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64002/historic-muscle-shoals-sound-studios-closes |title=Historic Muscle Shoals Sound Studios Closes  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=February 23, 2005 |website=Billboard.com|access-date=January 17, 2017 |quote=the last four years saw a sharp decline in outside projects.

Thousands of master tapes from recording sessions survived intact in a separate concrete vault. The company decided to re-build the damaged offices and recording studio on the same site and the new buildings were opened in the fall of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2012/jun/20/how-malaco-got-its-groove-back/ |title=How Malaco Got Its Groove Back |last=Lee |first=Garrad |date=June 20, 2012 |newspaper=[[Jackson Free Press]] |access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref> This storm came six years after [[Hurricane Katrina]] also hit the area, causing some damage to the Malaco premises.\n\n==Gospel==\nClearly the dominant contemporary southern blues label, Malaco purchased the gospel division of Savoy Records in 1986. Now, Malaco was also the preeminent black gospel company in North America. The Savoy acquisition brought a vast catalog of recordings, including albums by [[Shirley Caesar]], Rev. [[James Cleveland]], [[Albertina Walker]], [[The Caravans]], and [[Inez Andrews]]. In further expansion moves that year, Malaco entered the world of [[telemarketing]]. Malaco's gospel labels under Jerry Mannery, and Savoy Records under Milton Biggham, earned multiple honors, including Billboard designations as Top Gospel Label and Top Gospel Distributor, while the artists received numerous awards (Grammy, Stellar, Soul Train, and Gospel Music Workshop), as well as Billboard Top Gospel Artist of the Year designations.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The company also dominated Billboard Gospel charts, achieving No. 1 rankings by [[Keith Pringle]], [[Walter Hawkins]], Rev. James Moore, The [[Mississippi Mass Choir]], and [[Dorothy Norwood]].\n\n==Malaco Music Group==\nMalaco's market focus widened dramatically in 1995. Songwriter/producer Rich Cason cut \"Good Love\" with Johnnie Taylor. In 1996, Taylor's eighth album for Malaco, ''Good Love!'', reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Blues Albums]] chart (No. 15 R&B), and was the most commercially successful album in Malaco's history.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1997, Malaco was without a distribution deal and formed Malaco Music Group, which consists of Malaco Records and its subsidiaries. The company continued its steady, prudent expansion, purchasing half of the Memphis-based distributor [[Select-O-Hits]] and also making inroads into the [[urban contemporary]], [[jazz]], and contemporary [[Christian music|Christian]] markets.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nMalaco Records has been designated as a marker on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msbluestrail.org/blues_marker_list|title=List of Blues Trail Markers|website=Msbluestrail.org|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref> The company continue to release records in the 21st century.\n\n==Labels under Malaco==\n*[[Atlanta International Records]]\n*[[Savoy Records]]\n*[[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo Records]]\n*[[Shurfine Records]]\n*[[Juana Records]]\n*[[601 Records]]\n*[[Onyx Records]]\n\n==Artists==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Col-begin|width=90%}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Angelic Gospel Singers]]\n* [[Anita Ward]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeinmississippi.us/malaco-music-group/|title=Malaco Music Group|website=Madeinmississippi.us|accessdate=February 6, 2020}}</ref>\n*[[Blind Boys of Alabama]]\n*[[Bobby Bland]]<ref name=\"Source\"/>\n*[[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]]<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20294/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Bobby Rush |author=Ankeny, Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=February 21, 2020}}</ref> \n*[[Bryan Andrew Wilson]]\n*[[The Caravans]]\n*[[Clara Ward]] & The Famous Ward Singers\n* Clyde Bradley Singers\n*[[The Controllers (R&B band)|The Controllers]]\n*[[The Davis Sisters]]\n*[[Denise LaSalle]]\n* Dolores Barrett & Her Sisters\n*[[Dondria]]\n*[[Dorothy Moore]]<ref>Carpenter, Bil.
