However, the town was completely devoid of shopping malls and food stores, as they were totally unneeded. The sky provided the townsfolk with all of their required daily meals by raining (or in some cases, snowing) food. Unlike typical weather, the weather of Chewandswallow always came three times a day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinnertime. The only thing that was different was its weather; it didn't rain actual rain and it didn't snow actual snow. Instead, the weather was entirely food (juice or milk rain, mashed potato snow, clouds of hamburgers or fried eggs, etc).\n\nDespite not containing shopping malls and supermarkets to get food, Chewandswallow did contain restaurants. But roofless restaurants, where customers essentially served themselves the food that came down from the sky and into the roofless building (while the book never points it out, this essentially renders the restaurants totally useless). So for lunch one day, there were [[frankfurter]]s already in their buns. Then there were [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] clouds and [[baked bean]]s (for the frankfurters) and finally, a drizzle of soda (which finished off the meal). People could keep their food in refrigerators as meals or snacks whenever they felt hungry. \n\nThe town was also kept up by The Sanitation Department of Chewandswallow (which was a public clean-up service responsible for cleaning the leftover food from the day's weather). The service used the leftover food to feed stray pets, as well as sea creatures (including [[fish]], [[sea turtle]]s, and [[cetacean]]s) in the sea, [[bird]]s in the sky, and wildlife (the rest of the animals) on land. Some was also buried to enrich the soil. With the devoid of malls and grocery stores, this for the residents in the town of Chewandswallow was a much better arrangement. \n\nLife in the town of Chewandswallow was delicious for the town's residence. Well, at first, it was delicious. But after a couple of millenniums had passed (and all the excitement of the food in the weather died down), the weather (for the townspeople) gradually (but inexplicably) took them a turn for the worse. Then the people began to realize that they were not happy about it as they thought. It began with days where only one unappetizing food fell (spaghetti flooding the town, [[Gorgonzola]] cheese, overcooked and/or burned broccoli, birthday parties of not [[birthday cake]] but brussels sprouts and peanut butter with mayonnaise, and a pea soup fog) and included days where too much of a food fell (bread roll hurricane, drifts of sandwiches, etc).  During this time, the food also began to get bigger and more violent (pancake covering the school, tomato tornado). In the hurricane of bread and rolls, the mess took the workers four millenniums to clean up. In the pancake morning (where there was a storm of buttermilk pancakes with a downpour of maple syrup), when a giant pancake covered the school, after all attempts failed to get the giant pancake off, the school was closed forever. Lunch brought 50 or 60 inch drifts of cream cheese and jelly sandwiches. The children who were eating these sandwiches for lunch ate themselves sick and the day for them ended with a stomachache. \n\nAt last, the work (for the Sanitation Department of Chewandswallow's service and [[merchandise]]) became too infeasible. Because of this, the plans (of the Sanitation Department of Chewandswallow) announced the service would permanently discontinue service operations. The sanitation department (service and merchandise) gave up and shut down service operations for good. Then it was discontinued and would not run in service operations ever again. Houses and other structures were damaged, and the townspeople (left to suffer the oversized food since the sanitation department ceased service operations) began to fear for their lives. There was no more school for the children because the schools were closed for good. \n\nThere was no question in the people's minds about what to do in Chewandswallow (since it was now destroyed by weather conditions of oversized food). No questions about what to do. Finally, the residents of the town decided to permanently abandon the town. To leave the town for good, the people of Chewandswallow worked together to build boats. To build their ships, they [[cement]]ed together the giant slices of stale bread (sandwich style) with [[peanut butter]] and [[marshmallow creme]] making it a boat out of a peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwich (with sails made from giant slices of [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss cheese]] and slices of cheese/pepperoni pizza). After sailing up to a millennium, they arrived at the sea. They landed in a new town and were able to build houses from the stale bread their ships were made of. The bread houses turned into permanent houses on the new land. Nothing came down from the sky in the new land except for real weather equipment (including real rain and real snow). The real weather conditions (rain and snow) never again damaged anything in the new land (like the food weather conditions from Chewandswallow). \n\nThe children were able to begin school again (since new schools had been built and opened in the new town). As for food, the biggest change for the people (now they were in the permanently new town) was they never again got food from the sky. Instead, the people learned how to be used to getting their food from real stores (stores; including shopping malls and supermarkets). Plus, they presumably had to learn how to cook food prior to serving (as opposed to any meats which came down \"pre-cooked\" back at Chewandswallow). To cook food, they used real kitchen appliances. Nobody ever again got hit by a hamburger nor dared to ever go back to Chewandswallow to find out what happened to it. For they were too afraid. \n\nNow cutting back to the grandchildren, the grandfather finishes the bedtime story. The following morning, the grandchildren awaken to discover snowfall. After hurrying outside to play, the granddaughter imagines the rising sun reflecting on the snow is butter melting on mashed potatoes. At that, the girl states (on the last page), \"It's funny. But even as we were sliding down the hill, we thought we saw a giant pat of butter and we could almost smell mashed potatoes!\". The book ends with a picture of a bowl of mashed potatoes with butter melting on top (with the girl after she and Henry had that experience in the snow, pretending the bowl of real mashed potatoes is the snow and the real butter is the sun).\n\n==Sequels==\nThe follow up to the story, ''Pickles to Pittsburgh'', tells of the kids receiving a postcard from their grandfather, who claims to be visiting the ruins of what was once the fabled town of Chewandswallow. The kids then go to sleep and dream that they are there with him, helping to rebuild the post-apocalyptic landscape and restore it to where it is livable again, as well as giving the massive amounts of food away to poverty-stricken developing nations and homeless shelters around the world. This proves to be difficult, as there could be more food storms on the way.\n\nA third book in the series, ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3: Planet of the Pies'', was released on August 27, 2013. It details a dream Grandpa had about the first manned expedition to Mars, where Martian society is being overrun by daily storms of pies.\n\n==Film adaptations==\n{{Main|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (franchise)}}\nOn September 18, 2009, [[Sony Pictures Animation]] released an animated [[Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs (film)|film adaptation]] of the book, and the DVD was released on January 5, 2010.

Nirvana intended for the record to diverge significantly from the polished, refined production of its previous album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). Early in 1992, Cobain told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that he was sure that ''In Utero'' would showcase \"both of the extremes\" of its sound, saying \"it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others.  It won't be as one-dimensional [as ''Nevermind'']\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTo capture a more abrasive and natural sound, Nirvana hired engineer [[Steve Albini]] to record ''In Utero'' during a two-week period in February 1993 at [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]]. The music was quickly recorded within that time with few studio embellishments. The song lyrics and album packaging largely incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame. \n\nSoon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release ''In Utero'' in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable.  Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the band opted to remix parts of the album. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired [[R.E.M.]] producer [[Scott Litt]] to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" and \"[[All Apologies]]\".\n\nUpon release, ''In Utero'' reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from ''Nevermind''. \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" both reached number one on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Nirvana|title=Nirvana Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|5x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and has sold 15 million copies worldwide.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023705/http://www.nme.com/photos/20-things-you-didn-t-know-about-in-utero/320504 Nirvana: 20 Things You Didn't Know About 'In Utero'] ''NME''. dated September 10, 2013.

While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told ''Request'' magazine in 1993, \"For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' [by [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]] and ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'' [by [[The Breeders]]].\"  Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying.<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 5\u20136</ref>  Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album.  Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 313</ref>  Although he considered the group to be \"[[R.E.M.]] with a [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]]\" and \"an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound\", Albini told Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be \"the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with\", at the mercy of their record company.<ref name=\"caya 314\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 314</ref>  Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil.  In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the [[PJ Harvey]] album ''[[Rid of Me]]'' to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 39</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nThe members of Nirvana and Albini decided on a self-imposed two-week deadline for recording the album.  Wary of interference by DGC, Albini suggested the band members pay for the sessions with their own money, which they agreed to.  Studio fees totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]24,000, while Albini took a flat fee of $100,000 for his services.  Despite the suggestions of Nirvana's management company Gold Mountain, Albini refused to take percentage points on record sales, even though he stood to earn about $500,000 in royalties.<ref name=\"Cameron\">Cameron, Keith. \"This Is Pop\". ''Mojo''. May 2001.</ref>  While a common practice among producers in the music industry, Albini refused to take royalties because he considered it to be immoral and \"an insult to the artist\".<ref name=\"caya 314\" />\n[[File:2009-0528-PachydermStudio-drive.jpg|alt=|thumb|A sign welcomes visitors to the secluded location of Pachyderm Studios (now Seedy Underbelly North), where Nirvana stayed in virtual solitude while recording the album]]\nIn February 1993, Nirvana traveled to [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]], to record the album.<ref name=\"Gaar40\">Gaar, 2006. p. 40</ref>  Albini did not meet the band members until the first day of recording, though he had spoken to them beforehand about the type of album they wanted to make.  Albini observed that \"they wanted to make precisely the sort of record that I'm comfortable doing\".<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 36\u201337</ref>  The group stayed in a house located on the studio grounds during the recording sessions.  Novoselic compared the isolated conditions to a [[gulag]]; he added, \"There was snow outside, we couldn't go anywhere.  We just worked.\"<ref name=\"Gaar40\" />  For most of the sessions, the only people present were the band members, Albini, and technician [[Bob Weston]].<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" /><ref>Azerrad credits Weston as \"assistant engineer\", but the album liner notes list him as \"technician\".</ref>  The band made it clear to DGC and Gold Mountain that it did not want any intrusion during the album production, going as far as not playing any of the work in progress for its record label [[A&R]] representative.<ref name=\"Azerrad315\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 315</ref>  To prevent the group's managers and label from interfering, Albini instituted a strict policy of ignoring everyone except for the band members; the producer explained that everyone associated with the group aside from the musicians themselves were \"the biggest pieces of shit I ever met\".<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nThe band arrived at Pachyderm Studio without their equipment and spent much of the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail.  However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly.<ref name=\"Gaar40\" /><ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />  Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band.<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like \"Very Ape\" and \"{{not a typo|tourette's}}\", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural [[reverb]].  Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />  Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals.  The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape.<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 316</ref>  He said, \"Generally speaking, [Cobain] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...]  He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad317\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 317</ref>  Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours.<ref name=\"Gaar61\">Gaar, 2006. p. 61</ref>  The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard \"was supposedly this [[sexism|sexist]] jerk\", but called the process \"the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down\".<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain.  The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />\n\nThe album was [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] over five days.<ref name=\"Gaar61\" />  This rate was quick by Nirvana's standards, but not for Albini, who was used to mixing entire albums in a day or two.  On occasions when work on a song mix was not producing desired results, the band and Albini took the rest of the day off to watch nature videos, set things on fire, and make prank phone calls for amusement.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 318\u201319</ref>  The sessions were completed on February 26.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 64</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n|filename = Nirvana - Milk It.ogg\n|title = \"Milk It\"\n|description = \"Milk It\" displays the aggressive and more experimental sound Nirvana explored on ''In Utero''.\n|filename2 = Nirvana - Rape Me from In Utero.ogg\n|title2 = \"Rape Me\"\n|description2 = \"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song.\n}}\nAlbini sought to produce a record that sounded nothing like ''Nevermind''.<ref name=\"caya 314\" />  He felt the sound of ''Nevermind'' was \"sort of a standard hack recording that has been turned into a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...]  That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band.\"  Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound.<ref name=\"Azerrad317\" />  Albini refused to [[doubletracking|double-track]] Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room.<ref name=\"Azerrad317\" />  The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, \"There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'&nbsp;... that was also done at the end of '[[Rape Me]]', where [Cobain] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band.\"<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 45</ref>  Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural [[reverberation]] of the room.  Albini explained, \"If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad317\" />\n\nAzerrad asserted in his 1993 biography ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'' that the music of ''In Utero'' showcased divergent sensibilities of abrasiveness and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album's completion.  He wrote, \"The [[The Beatles|Beatlesque]] 'Dumb' happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied [[Punk rock|punk]] graffiti of 'Milk It,' while 'All Apologies' is worlds away from the apoplectic '[[Scentless Apprentice]].'  It's as if [Cobain] has given up trying to meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole.  Forget it.  This is war.\"  Cobain believed, however, that ''In Utero'' was not \"any harsher or any more emotional\" than any of Nirvana's previous records.<ref name=\"Azerrad321\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 321</ref>  Novoselic concurred with Azerrad's comments that the album's music leaned more towards the band's \"arty, aggressive side\"; the bassist said, \"There's always been [Nirvana] songs like '[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]' and there's always been songs like 'Paper Cuts'...  ''Nevermind'' came out kind of 'About a Girl'-y and this [album] came out more 'Paper Cuts'\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 332\u201333</ref>  Cobain cited the track \"Milk It\" as an example of the more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band's music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio.<ref name=\"Azerrad323\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 323</ref>  Novoselic viewed the album's singles \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" and \"[[All Apologies]]\" as \"gateways\" to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling journalist [[Jim DeRogatis]] that once listeners played the record, they would discover \"this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record\".<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 18</ref>\n\nSeveral of the songs on ''In Utero'' had been written years prior to recording; some of them dated back to 1990.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 3</ref>  With tracks like \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\", Cobain favored long song titles in reaction to contemporary alternative rock bands that utilized single-word titles.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 326\u201327</ref>  Cobain continued to work on the lyrics while recording at Pachyderm Studio.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 41</ref>  Nonetheless, Cobain told [[Darcey Steinke]] in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that, in contrast to ''Bleach'' and ''Nevermind'', the lyrics were \"more focused, they're almost built on themes.\"<ref name=\"smashing\">Steinke, Darcey. \"Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock\". ''Spin'': pp. 42\u201349. October 1993.</ref>  Michael Azerrad asserted that the lyrics were less impressionistic and more straightforward than in previous Nirvana songs.  Azerrad also noted that \"[v]irtually every song contains some image of sickness and disease\".<ref name=\"Azerrad321\" />  In a number of songs, Cobain made reference to books he had read.  \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\" was inspired by ''[[Shadowland (Arnold novel)|Shadowland]]'', a 1978 biography of actress [[Frances Farmer]], with whom Cobain had been fascinated ever since he read the book in high school.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 50\u201351</ref>  The song \"Scentless Apprentice\" was written about ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]'', a historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the \"ultimate perfume\" by killing virgin women and taking their scent.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nCobain stated in a 1993 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' that \"for the most part [''In Utero'']'s very impersonal\".<ref>Savage, Jon. \"Sounds Dirty: The Truth About Nirvana\". ''The Observer''. August 15, 1993.</ref>  The songwriter also told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental.<ref>Sutcliffe, Phil. \"Kurt Cobain: King of Pain\". ''Q''. October 1993.</ref>  However, Azerrad argued that much of the album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view.  Grohl said, \"A lot of what he has to say is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through.  And it's not so much teen angst anymore.  It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst.\"<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 322</ref>  Cobain downplayed recent events (\"I really haven't had that exciting a life\") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that \"Rape Me\" seemed to deal with that very issue.  While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light.<ref>Azerrad, 1994, p. 322\u201323</ref>  \"Serve The Servants\" contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult.  The opening lines \"Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old\" were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 325</ref>  Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line \"That legendary divorce is such a bore\" from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines \"I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before\".  Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 326</ref>\n\n==Title and packaging==\n[[File:EMP Museum - Nirvana (15632798960).jpg|thumb|The front cover alongside an angel-winged mannequin in the manner of the album artwork, at the [[Experience Music Project]] museum's Nirvana exhibit]]\nCobain originally wanted to name the album ''I Hate Myself and I Want to Die'', a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992.<ref>Cross, 2001. p. 277</ref>  At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone asked him how he was doing.  Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was \"tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 330</ref>  Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit.  The band then considered using ''Verse Chorus Verse''\u2014a title taken from its song \"Verse Chorus Verse\", and an earlier working title of \"Sappy\"\u2014before eventually settling on ''In Utero''.  The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.<ref>Cross, 2001. p. 278</ref>\n\nThe art director for ''In Utero'' was Robert Fisher, who had designed all of Nirvana's releases on DGC.  Most of the ideas for the artwork for the album and related singles came from Cobain.  Fisher recalled that \"[Cobain] would just give me some loose odds and ends and say 'Do something with it.'\"<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 79</ref>  The cover of the album is an image of a [[Transparent Anatomical Manikin]], with angel wings superimposed.  Cobain created the collage on the back cover, which he described as \"Sex and woman and ''In Utero'' and vaginas and birth and death\", that consists of model fetuses, a turtle shell and models of turtles, and body parts lying in a bed of orchids and lilies.  The collage had been set up on the floor of Cobain's living room and was photographed by [[Charles Peterson (photographer)|Charles Peterson]] after an unexpected call from Cobain.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 83</ref>  The album's track listing and re-illustrated symbols from [[Barbara G. Walker]]'s ''The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects'' were then positioned around the edge of the collage.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 84</ref>\n\nMannequins of the angel-winged anatomical figure were used as stage props on Nirvana's concert tour supporting ''In Utero''. One such mannequin later featured at the [[Experience Music Project]] museum's exhibition \"Nirvana: Taking Punk to the Masses\", which ran from April 2011 through 2013 and showcased memorabilia celebrating the band's music and history.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|date=October 14, 2010|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/news/emp-stage-world-s-most-extensive-nirvana-exhibit|title=EMP to Stage World's Most Extensive Nirvana Exhibit|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Production controversy and remixing==\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \"The grown-ups don't like it.\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \"not up to par\", the sound was \"unlistenable\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 331</ref>  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year\u2014there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself\u2014I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing ''In Utero'' as it was.  According to Cobain, \"Of course, they want another ''Nevermind'', but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\"<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 332</ref>\n\nThe band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\"<ref>Mothersole, Ben. \"Nirvana's Kurt Cobain: Getting to Know Utero\". ''Circus''. November 30, 1993.</ref>  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'  And I don't think he felt he had that yet&nbsp;...  My problem was that I feared a slippery slope.\"<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 69</ref>  The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the [[Audio mastering|mastering]] process with [[Bob Ludwig]] at his studio in [[Portland, Maine]].  Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 336</ref>\n[[File:BobLudwigGateway.jpg|alt=|thumb|Audio mastering technician Bob Ludwig (pictured in 2008) was recruited to help make the album sound acceptable to DGC Records.]]\n\nSoon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.<ref>[[Greg Kot|Kot, Greg]]. \"Record Label Finds Little Bliss in Nirvana's Latest\". ''Chicago Tribune''. April 19, 1993.</ref>  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.  All I know is&nbsp;... we made a record, everybody was happy with it.  A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\".<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 66</ref>  While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, ''[[Newsweek]]'' ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.<ref>Goodman, Fred. \"Nirvana to 'Newsweek': Drop dead\". ''Rolling Stone''. June 24, 1993.</ref>  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to ''Newsweek'' that said that the article's author \"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous {{sic}} information\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder [[David Geffen]] made the unusual move of personally calling ''Newsweek'' to complain about the article.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 336\u201337</ref>\n\nNirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer [[Scott Litt]] and remixing some tracks with [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] (who had mixed ''Nevermind'').  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.  The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" with Litt at Seattle's [[Bad Animals Studio]] in May 1993.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 337\u201338</ref>  Furthermore, a remix of \"Pennyroyal Tea\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of ''In Utero''; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, ''[[Nirvana (Nirvana album)|Nirvana]]'', and is the same mix that appeared on the single.  One song, \"[[I Hate Myself and Want to Die]]\", was omitted from the final track listing as Cobain felt there were too many \"noise\" songs on the album.<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 6</ref>  The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three [[decibel]]s.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 338</ref>  Albini was critical of the album's final mix; he said, \"The end result, the record in the stores doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made.  Though it's still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it still comes across.\"<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n==Marketing and sales==\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting ''In Utero''; the company's head of marketing told ''Billboard'' before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of ''Nevermind'', and explained that the label would \"set things up, duck, and get out of the way\".  The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] as part of this strategy.<ref name=\"Rosen\">Rosen, Craig. \"Nirvana Set Has Smell of Success\". ''Billboard''. September 25, 1993.</ref>  In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of ''In Utero'''s singles commercially in the United States.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />  DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, \"Heart-Shaped Box\", to American [[Campus radio|college]], [[modern rock]], and [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations in early September, but the label did not target [[Top 40]] radio.<ref name=\"Rosen\" />  Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that ''In Utero'' would not be as successful as ''Nevermind''.  Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, \"We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much.\"<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 4</ref>\n\n''In Utero'' was released on September 13, 1993, on vinyl record and [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]] in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies.<ref name=\"Gaar97\">Gaar, 2006. p. 97</ref><ref>\"[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308376,00.html In the Works: Pearl Jam on Vinyl]\".

Nirvana intended for the record to diverge significantly from the polished, refined production of its previous album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). Early in 1992, Cobain told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that he was sure that ''In Utero'' would showcase \"both of the extremes\" of its sound, saying \"it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others.  It won't be as one-dimensional [as ''Nevermind'']\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTo capture a more abrasive and natural sound, Nirvana hired engineer [[Steve Albini]] to record ''In Utero'' during a two-week period in February 1993 at [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]]. The music was quickly recorded within that time with few studio embellishments. The song lyrics and album packaging largely incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame. \n\nSoon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release ''In Utero'' in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable.  Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the band opted to remix parts of the album. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired [[R.E.M.]] producer [[Scott Litt]] to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" and \"[[All Apologies]]\".\n\nUpon release, ''In Utero'' reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from ''Nevermind''. \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" both reached number one on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Nirvana|title=Nirvana Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|5x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and has sold 15 million copies worldwide.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023705/http://www.nme.com/photos/20-things-you-didn-t-know-about-in-utero/320504 Nirvana: 20 Things You Didn't Know About 'In Utero'] ''NME''. dated September 10, 2013.

''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]''. February 14, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn a ''[[Melody Maker]]'' interview published in July 1992, Cobain told the English journalist [[Everett True]] that he was interested in recording with [[Jack Endino]] (who had produced the group's 1989 d\u00e9but album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'') and [[Steve Albini]] (former frontman of the [[noise rock]] band [[Big Black]] and producer for various independent releases).

July 25, 1992.</ref>  In October 1992, Nirvana recorded several songs (mainly as instrumentals) during a demo session with Endino in Seattle; they later re-recorded many of these songs for ''In Utero''.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 17</ref>  Endino recalled that the band did not ask him to produce its next record, but noted that the band members constantly debated working with Albini.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 21\u201322</ref>  The group recorded another set of demos while on tour in Brazil in January 1993.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 23</ref>  One of the recordings from this session, the long improvisational track \"Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip\", was included as a hidden track on non-U.S. CD copies of ''In Utero''.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nNirvana ultimately chose Albini to record its third album.<ref name=\"AllMusic review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-utero-mw0000097301 |title=In Utero \u2013 Nirvana |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>  Albini had a reputation as a principled and opinionated individual in the American [[independent music]] scene.  While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told ''Request'' magazine in 1993, \"For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' [by [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]] and ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'' [by [[The Breeders]]].\"  Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying.<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 5\u20136</ref>  Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album.  Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 313</ref>  Although he considered the group to be \"[[R.E.M.]] with a [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]]\" and \"an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound\", Albini told Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be \"the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with\", at the mercy of their record company.<ref name=\"caya 314\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 314</ref>  Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil.  In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the [[PJ Harvey]] album ''[[Rid of Me]]'' to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 39</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nThe members of Nirvana and Albini decided on a self-imposed two-week deadline for recording the album.  Wary of interference by DGC, Albini suggested the band members pay for the sessions with their own money, which they agreed to.  Studio fees totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]24,000, while Albini took a flat fee of $100,000 for his services.  Despite the suggestions of Nirvana's management company Gold Mountain, Albini refused to take percentage points on record sales, even though he stood to earn about $500,000 in royalties.<ref name=\"Cameron\">Cameron, Keith. \"This Is Pop\". ''Mojo''. May 2001.</ref>  While a common practice among producers in the music industry, Albini refused to take royalties because he considered it to be immoral and \"an insult to the artist\".<ref name=\"caya 314\" />\n[[File:2009-0528-PachydermStudio-drive.jpg|alt=|thumb|A sign welcomes visitors to the secluded location of Pachyderm Studios (now Seedy Underbelly North), where Nirvana stayed in virtual solitude while recording the album]]\nIn February 1993, Nirvana traveled to [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]], to record the album.<ref name=\"Gaar40\">Gaar, 2006. p. 40</ref>  Albini did not meet the band members until the first day of recording, though he had spoken to them beforehand about the type of album they wanted to make.  Albini observed that \"they wanted to make precisely the sort of record that I'm comfortable doing\".<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 36\u201337</ref>  The group stayed in a house located on the studio grounds during the recording sessions.  Novoselic compared the isolated conditions to a [[gulag]]; he added, \"There was snow outside, we couldn't go anywhere.  We just worked.\"<ref name=\"Gaar40\" />  For most of the sessions, the only people present were the band members, Albini, and technician [[Bob Weston]].<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" /><ref>Azerrad credits Weston as \"assistant engineer\", but the album liner notes list him as \"technician\".</ref>  The band made it clear to DGC and Gold Mountain that it did not want any intrusion during the album production, going as far as not playing any of the work in progress for its record label [[A&R]] representative.<ref name=\"Azerrad315\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 315</ref>  To prevent the group's managers and label from interfering, Albini instituted a strict policy of ignoring everyone except for the band members; the producer explained that everyone associated with the group aside from the musicians themselves were \"the biggest pieces of shit I ever met\".<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nThe band arrived at Pachyderm Studio without their equipment and spent much of the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail.  However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly.<ref name=\"Gaar40\" /><ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />  Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band.<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like \"Very Ape\" and \"{{not a typo|tourette's}}\", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural [[reverb]].  Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />  Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals.  The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape.<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 316</ref>  He said, \"Generally speaking, [Cobain] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...]  He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad317\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 317</ref>  Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours.<ref name=\"Gaar61\">Gaar, 2006. p. 61</ref>  The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard \"was supposedly this [[sexism|sexist]] jerk\", but called the process \"the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down\".<ref name=\"Azerrad315\" />  The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain.  The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />\n\nThe album was [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] over five days.<ref name=\"Gaar61\" />  This rate was quick by Nirvana's standards, but not for Albini, who was used to mixing entire albums in a day or two.  On occasions when work on a song mix was not producing desired results, the band and Albini took the rest of the day off to watch nature videos, set things on fire, and make prank phone calls for amusement.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 318\u201319</ref>  The sessions were completed on February 26.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 64</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n|filename = Nirvana - Milk It.ogg\n|title = \"Milk It\"\n|description = \"Milk It\" displays the aggressive and more experimental sound Nirvana explored on ''In Utero''.\n|filename2 = Nirvana - Rape Me from In Utero.ogg\n|title2 = \"Rape Me\"\n|description2 = \"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song.\n}}\nAlbini sought to produce a record that sounded nothing like ''Nevermind''.<ref name=\"caya 314\" />  He felt the sound of ''Nevermind'' was \"sort of a standard hack recording that has been turned into a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...]  That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band.\"  Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound.<ref name=\"Azerrad317\" />  Albini refused to [[doubletracking|double-track]] Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room.<ref name=\"Azerrad317\" />  The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, \"There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'&nbsp;... that was also done at the end of '[[Rape Me]]', where [Cobain] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band.\"<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 45</ref>  Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural [[reverberation]] of the room.  Albini explained, \"If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad317\" />\n\nAzerrad asserted in his 1993 biography ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'' that the music of ''In Utero'' showcased divergent sensibilities of abrasiveness and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album's completion.  He wrote, \"The [[The Beatles|Beatlesque]] 'Dumb' happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied [[Punk rock|punk]] graffiti of 'Milk It,' while 'All Apologies' is worlds away from the apoplectic '[[Scentless Apprentice]].'  It's as if [Cobain] has given up trying to meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole.  Forget it.  This is war.\"  Cobain believed, however, that ''In Utero'' was not \"any harsher or any more emotional\" than any of Nirvana's previous records.<ref name=\"Azerrad321\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 321</ref>  Novoselic concurred with Azerrad's comments that the album's music leaned more towards the band's \"arty, aggressive side\"; the bassist said, \"There's always been [Nirvana] songs like '[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]' and there's always been songs like 'Paper Cuts'...  ''Nevermind'' came out kind of 'About a Girl'-y and this [album] came out more 'Paper Cuts'\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 332\u201333</ref>  Cobain cited the track \"Milk It\" as an example of the more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band's music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio.<ref name=\"Azerrad323\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 323</ref>  Novoselic viewed the album's singles \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" and \"[[All Apologies]]\" as \"gateways\" to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling journalist [[Jim DeRogatis]] that once listeners played the record, they would discover \"this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record\".<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 18</ref>\n\nSeveral of the songs on ''In Utero'' had been written years prior to recording; some of them dated back to 1990.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 3</ref>  With tracks like \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\", Cobain favored long song titles in reaction to contemporary alternative rock bands that utilized single-word titles.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 326\u201327</ref>  Cobain continued to work on the lyrics while recording at Pachyderm Studio.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 41</ref>  Nonetheless, Cobain told [[Darcey Steinke]] in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that, in contrast to ''Bleach'' and ''Nevermind'', the lyrics were \"more focused, they're almost built on themes.\"<ref name=\"smashing\">Steinke, Darcey. \"Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock\". ''Spin'': pp. 42\u201349. October 1993.</ref>  Michael Azerrad asserted that the lyrics were less impressionistic and more straightforward than in previous Nirvana songs.  Azerrad also noted that \"[v]irtually every song contains some image of sickness and disease\".<ref name=\"Azerrad321\" />  In a number of songs, Cobain made reference to books he had read.  \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\" was inspired by ''[[Shadowland (Arnold novel)|Shadowland]]'', a 1978 biography of actress [[Frances Farmer]], with whom Cobain had been fascinated ever since he read the book in high school.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 50\u201351</ref>  The song \"Scentless Apprentice\" was written about ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]'', a historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the \"ultimate perfume\" by killing virgin women and taking their scent.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nCobain stated in a 1993 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' that \"for the most part [''In Utero'']'s very impersonal\".<ref>Savage, Jon. \"Sounds Dirty: The Truth About Nirvana\". ''The Observer''. August 15, 1993.</ref>  The songwriter also told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental.<ref>Sutcliffe, Phil. \"Kurt Cobain: King of Pain\". ''Q''. October 1993.</ref>  However, Azerrad argued that much of the album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view.  Grohl said, \"A lot of what he has to say is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through.  And it's not so much teen angst anymore.  It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst.\"<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 322</ref>  Cobain downplayed recent events (\"I really haven't had that exciting a life\") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that \"Rape Me\" seemed to deal with that very issue.  While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light.<ref>Azerrad, 1994, p. 322\u201323</ref>  \"Serve The Servants\" contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult.  The opening lines \"Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old\" were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 325</ref>  Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line \"That legendary divorce is such a bore\" from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines \"I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before\".  Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 326</ref>\n\n==Title and packaging==\n[[File:EMP Museum - Nirvana (15632798960).jpg|thumb|The front cover alongside an angel-winged mannequin in the manner of the album artwork, at the [[Experience Music Project]] museum's Nirvana exhibit]]\nCobain originally wanted to name the album ''I Hate Myself and I Want to Die'', a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992.<ref>Cross, 2001. p. 277</ref>  At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone asked him how he was doing.  Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was \"tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 330</ref>  Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit.  The band then considered using ''Verse Chorus Verse''\u2014a title taken from its song \"Verse Chorus Verse\", and an earlier working title of \"Sappy\"\u2014before eventually settling on ''In Utero''.  The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.<ref>Cross, 2001. p. 278</ref>\n\nThe art director for ''In Utero'' was Robert Fisher, who had designed all of Nirvana's releases on DGC.  Most of the ideas for the artwork for the album and related singles came from Cobain.  Fisher recalled that \"[Cobain] would just give me some loose odds and ends and say 'Do something with it.'\"<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 79</ref>  The cover of the album is an image of a [[Transparent Anatomical Manikin]], with angel wings superimposed.  Cobain created the collage on the back cover, which he described as \"Sex and woman and ''In Utero'' and vaginas and birth and death\", that consists of model fetuses, a turtle shell and models of turtles, and body parts lying in a bed of orchids and lilies.  The collage had been set up on the floor of Cobain's living room and was photographed by [[Charles Peterson (photographer)|Charles Peterson]] after an unexpected call from Cobain.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 83</ref>  The album's track listing and re-illustrated symbols from [[Barbara G. Walker]]'s ''The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects'' were then positioned around the edge of the collage.<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 84</ref>\n\nMannequins of the angel-winged anatomical figure were used as stage props on Nirvana's concert tour supporting ''In Utero''. One such mannequin later featured at the [[Experience Music Project]] museum's exhibition \"Nirvana: Taking Punk to the Masses\", which ran from April 2011 through 2013 and showcased memorabilia celebrating the band's music and history.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|date=October 14, 2010|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/news/emp-stage-world-s-most-extensive-nirvana-exhibit|title=EMP to Stage World's Most Extensive Nirvana Exhibit|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Production controversy and remixing==\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \"The grown-ups don't like it.\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \"not up to par\", the sound was \"unlistenable\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 331</ref>  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year\u2014there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself\u2014I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing ''In Utero'' as it was.  According to Cobain, \"Of course, they want another ''Nevermind'', but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\"<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 332</ref>\n\nThe band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\"<ref>Mothersole, Ben. \"Nirvana's Kurt Cobain: Getting to Know Utero\". ''Circus''. November 30, 1993.</ref>  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'  And I don't think he felt he had that yet&nbsp;...  My problem was that I feared a slippery slope.\"<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 69</ref>  The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the [[Audio mastering|mastering]] process with [[Bob Ludwig]] at his studio in [[Portland, Maine]].  Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 336</ref>\n[[File:BobLudwigGateway.jpg|alt=|thumb|Audio mastering technician Bob Ludwig (pictured in 2008) was recruited to help make the album sound acceptable to DGC Records.]]\n\nSoon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.<ref>[[Greg Kot|Kot, Greg]]. \"Record Label Finds Little Bliss in Nirvana's Latest\". ''Chicago Tribune''. April 19, 1993.</ref>  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.  All I know is&nbsp;... we made a record, everybody was happy with it.  A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\".<ref>Gaar, 2006. p. 66</ref>  While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, ''[[Newsweek]]'' ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.<ref>Goodman, Fred. \"Nirvana to 'Newsweek': Drop dead\". ''Rolling Stone''. June 24, 1993.</ref>  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to ''Newsweek'' that said that the article's author \"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous {{sic}} information\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder [[David Geffen]] made the unusual move of personally calling ''Newsweek'' to complain about the article.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 336\u201337</ref>\n\nNirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer [[Scott Litt]] and remixing some tracks with [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] (who had mixed ''Nevermind'').  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.  The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" with Litt at Seattle's [[Bad Animals Studio]] in May 1993.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 337\u201338</ref>  Furthermore, a remix of \"Pennyroyal Tea\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of ''In Utero''; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, ''[[Nirvana (Nirvana album)|Nirvana]]'', and is the same mix that appeared on the single.  One song, \"[[I Hate Myself and Want to Die]]\", was omitted from the final track listing as Cobain felt there were too many \"noise\" songs on the album.<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 6</ref>  The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three [[decibel]]s.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 338</ref>  Albini was critical of the album's final mix; he said, \"The end result, the record in the stores doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made.  Though it's still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it still comes across.\"<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n==Marketing and sales==\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting ''In Utero''; the company's head of marketing told ''Billboard'' before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of ''Nevermind'', and explained that the label would \"set things up, duck, and get out of the way\".  The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] as part of this strategy.<ref name=\"Rosen\">Rosen, Craig. \"Nirvana Set Has Smell of Success\". ''Billboard''. September 25, 1993.</ref>  In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of ''In Utero'''s singles commercially in the United States.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />  DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, \"Heart-Shaped Box\", to American [[Campus radio|college]], [[modern rock]], and [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations in early September, but the label did not target [[Top 40]] radio.<ref name=\"Rosen\" />  Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that ''In Utero'' would not be as successful as ''Nevermind''.  Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, \"We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much.\"<ref>DeRogatis, 2003. p. 4</ref>\n\n''In Utero'' was released on September 13, 1993, on vinyl record and [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]] in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies.<ref name=\"Gaar97\">Gaar, 2006. p. 97</ref><ref>\"[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308376,00.html In the Works: Pearl Jam on Vinyl]\".

In a 2003 ''[[Guitar World]]'' article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album's release, Cobain biographer [[Charles R. Cross]] argued that ''In Utero'' was \"a far better record [than ''Nevermind''] and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then ''In Utero'' is that lost pearl.\"<ref>Cross, Charles R. \"Bollocks to Nevermind...Here's in Utero\".

Created by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]] in January 2015 with original story by K\u014d Nakamura, the project began as a [[manga]] before expanding to other media. In addition to other manga, ''BanG Dream!'' includes an [[anime]] television series, live concerts, music CDs and videos, and the mobile [[rhythm game]] ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!'' by Craft Egg.\n\nThe franchise's premise is based around [[all-female band]]s whose members are also voice actresses in the anime and mobile game; {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, the project has seven groups, four of which are capable of playing their respective characters' instruments. The first band, Poppin'Party, was formed in February 2015, and further groups were introduced in 2017 with the launch of the mobile game: Afterglow, Pastel\uff0aPalettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World!. At the end of 2018, a [[backup band]] called The Third was renamed to Raise A Suilen and joined the series, followed by a seventh unit named Morfonica in 2020. For live performances, Poppin'Party, Roselia, Raise A Suilen, and Morfonica's voice actresses play their own music, while the others are limited to vocals.\n\nThe anime currently consists of three seasons. The first season, produced by Issen ([[OLM, Inc.|OLM]] with Bushiroad) and [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], aired from January to April 2017. [[Sanzigen]] took over production duties for the second and third seasons, which were respectively broadcast in winter 2019 and 2020. A movie ''BanG Dream! Film Live'' premiered in 2019, while a sequel has been announced. Spin-off anime series include ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico'' and its sequel ''Pico ~Ohmori~'' by Sanzigen with DMM.futureworks and ''Pastel Life'' by [[Studio A-Cat]].\n\nThe series has enjoyed international popularity for its live performances and mobile game, while the anime has seen mixed but improving reviews with later seasons. In 2018, the franchise expanded to include a male-based counterpart ''[[Argonavis from BanG Dream!]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of BanG Dream! characters}}\n''BanG Dream!'' follows Kasumi Toyama, a happy-go-lucky girl and a new student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School. During her first weeks at the school, she tries out for numerous clubs in an effort to rediscover the \"Star Beat\", a \"sparkling, heart-pounding\" feeling she experienced while looking up at the stars in the night sky as a child.\n\nOne day, while returning from school, she spots a trail of star stickers that lead her to a pawnshop owned by her classmate Arisa Ichigaya. In the storage area, she finds a star-shaped guitar with glittery stickers on it and quickly becomes attached to it. The two later visit a local [[live house]], SPACE, where Kasumi decides to create a band upon watching a performance by a group named Glitter*Green. She then recruits Arisa and three of their classmates \u2013 S\u0101ya Yamabuki, Tae Hanazono, and Rimi Ushigome \u2013 to join her, though they are reluctant for personal reasons. Despite their initial misgivings, the five overcome many hurdles and ultimately agree to form the band \"Poppin'Party\". With her band mates, Kasumi finds the excitement that she had been looking for.\n\nDuring their first year of high school, Poppin'Party meet and befriend four all-girl bands at Hanasakigawa and nearby Haneoka Girls' High School, each of whom have their own stories: Afterglow consists of five childhood friends who maintain their friendship through music; Pastel\uff0aPalettes are an [[Japanese idol|idol group]] who are capable of playing their own instruments; Roselia strives to become the perfect band; and Hello, Happy World! is an eccentric band that seeks to spread happiness.\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''BanG Dream!'' was created in March 2014 by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]], who wanted to lead a music project after seeing the success of ''[[Love Live!

Created by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]] in January 2015 with original story by K\u014d Nakamura, the project began as a [[manga]] before expanding to other media. In addition to other manga, ''BanG Dream!'' includes an [[anime]] television series, live concerts, music CDs and videos, and the mobile [[rhythm game]] ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!'' by Craft Egg.\n\nThe franchise's premise is based around [[all-female band]]s whose members are also voice actresses in the anime and mobile game; {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, the project has seven groups, four of which are capable of playing their respective characters' instruments. The first band, Poppin'Party, was formed in February 2015, and further groups were introduced in 2017 with the launch of the mobile game: Afterglow, Pastel\uff0aPalettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World!. At the end of 2018, a [[backup band]] called The Third was renamed to Raise A Suilen and joined the series, followed by a seventh unit named Morfonica in 2020. For live performances, Poppin'Party, Roselia, Raise A Suilen, and Morfonica's voice actresses play their own music, while the others are limited to vocals.\n\nThe anime currently consists of three seasons. The first season, produced by Issen ([[OLM, Inc.|OLM]] with Bushiroad) and [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], aired from January to April 2017. [[Sanzigen]] took over production duties for the second and third seasons, which were respectively broadcast in winter 2019 and 2020. A movie ''BanG Dream! Film Live'' premiered in 2019, while a sequel has been announced. Spin-off anime series include ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico'' and its sequel ''Pico ~Ohmori~'' by Sanzigen with DMM.futureworks and ''Pastel Life'' by [[Studio A-Cat]].\n\nThe series has enjoyed international popularity for its live performances and mobile game, while the anime has seen mixed but improving reviews with later seasons. In 2018, the franchise expanded to include a male-based counterpart ''[[Argonavis from BanG Dream!]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of BanG Dream! characters}}\n''BanG Dream!'' follows Kasumi Toyama, a happy-go-lucky girl and a new student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School. During her first weeks at the school, she tries out for numerous clubs in an effort to rediscover the \"Star Beat\", a \"sparkling, heart-pounding\" feeling she experienced while looking up at the stars in the night sky as a child.\n\nOne day, while returning from school, she spots a trail of star stickers that lead her to a pawnshop owned by her classmate Arisa Ichigaya. In the storage area, she finds a star-shaped guitar with glittery stickers on it and quickly becomes attached to it. The two later visit a local [[live house]], SPACE, where Kasumi decides to create a band upon watching a performance by a group named Glitter*Green. She then recruits Arisa and three of their classmates \u2013 S\u0101ya Yamabuki, Tae Hanazono, and Rimi Ushigome \u2013 to join her, though they are reluctant for personal reasons. Despite their initial misgivings, the five overcome many hurdles and ultimately agree to form the band \"Poppin'Party\". With her band mates, Kasumi finds the excitement that she had been looking for.\n\nDuring their first year of high school, Poppin'Party meet and befriend four all-girl bands at Hanasakigawa and nearby Haneoka Girls' High School, each of whom have their own stories: Afterglow consists of five childhood friends who maintain their friendship through music; Pastel\uff0aPalettes are an [[Japanese idol|idol group]] who are capable of playing their own instruments; Roselia strives to become the perfect band; and Hello, Happy World! is an eccentric band that seeks to spread happiness.\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''BanG Dream!'' was created in March 2014 by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]], who wanted to lead a music project after seeing the success of ''[[Love Live! School Idol Festival]]'', a mobile game published by his company.<ref name=\"Kidani interview\">{{cite interview|last=Kidani|first=Takaaki|subject-link=Takaaki Kidani|interviewer=''Real Sound''|url=https://magnavalon.com/2019/05/19/bang-dream-interview-with-bushiroads-takaaki-kidani-the-path-and-future-of-bang-dream-project-part-1/|title=BanG Dream!
