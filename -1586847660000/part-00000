The first occurred between Jackson and Hattiesburg, dealing direct blows or close passes to the towns of [[Bassfield, Mississippi|Bassfield]], [[Seminary, Mississippi|Seminary]], [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], and [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]]. The first tornado completely leveled several homes in Walthall County including a brick home that was swept completely away and had the plumbing fixtures ripped away, and a cafe in Bassfield was swept away with nothing but a bare slab remaining and killed 3 people at that location.  A second tornado followed a similar path from north of Bassfield, close to [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], and northeast toward [[Enterprise, Clarke County, Mississippi|Enterprise]]. Tornado emergencies were issued for both tornadoes, with some communities encompassed in both, a rare occurrence potentially not seen since 1999.
