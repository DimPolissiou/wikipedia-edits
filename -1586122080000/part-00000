In 1939 the firm planned a machine of 85 to 90 tons, but the plans were curtailed by the start of the war. Resumed in 1943, the study resulted in a design of 150 tons, which ultimately became the [[Saunders-Roe Princess]], of which only three examples were manufactured.\n\nDespite this failure, Saro was contacted by J.

He was interested in a plane that could carry at least 1,000 passengers under the conditions of comfort of a transatlantic ocean liner.

Paramaribo has a population of roughly 241,000 people (2012 census), almost half of Suriname's population. The historic inner city of Paramaribo has been a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 2002.\n\n== Name ==\nThe city is named for the Paramaribo tribe living at the mouth of the Suriname River; the name is from [[Tupi\u2013Guarani languages|Tupi\u2013Guarani]] ''para'' \"large river\" + ''maribo'' \"inhabitants\".<ref>E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow: Russkie slovari, 1998), p. 322.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 3728-375 Litho voorstellende een marktgezicht.jpg|thumb|left|1830s [[lithograph]] of the market]]\n\nThe name Paramaribo is probably a corruption of the name of an Indian village, Parmirbo{{fact|date=March 2020}}. This was the location of the first Dutch settlement, a trading post established by Nicolaes Baliestel and Dirck Claeszoon van Sanen in 1613. English and French traders also tried to establish settlements in Suriname, including a French post established in 1644 near present-day Paramaribo.\n\nThe Dutch settlement was abandoned some time before the arrival of English settlers in 1650 to found [[Willoughbyland]]. The settlers were sent by the English governor of Barbados, Lord [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham]], and established a town on the site of Paramaribo (though probably south of the current town center). The town was protected by a fort, called [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Willoughby]]. In 1662, Governor Willoughby was granted the settlement and surrounding lands (extending into Suriname's interior) by King Charles II.\n\nIn 1667, during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], Paramaribo was conquered by a squadron of ships under [[Abraham Crijnssen]]. The [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] in 1667 confirmed Paramaribo as the leading town of the now Dutch colony of Suriname. The fort protecting Paramaribo was renamed Fort Zeelandia in honor of the Dutch province that had financed Crijnssen's fleet. (The town was also renamed New Middelburg but the name did not catch on with the inhabitants).\n\nThe population of Paramaribo has always been very diverse. Among the first British settlers were many [[Jews]] <ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/524/ |title = Extract of the Dutch Map Representing the Colony of Surinam |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1777 |accessdate = 2013-07-13 }}</ref> and one of the oldest [[synagogues]] in the [[Americas]] is found in Paramaribo.<ref name=TFox>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Tamar|title=Discovering Suriname's Jewish past - and present|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021804253.html|work=Travel|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=18 February 2011}}</ref> The population of the town was greatly increased after 1873, when former slaves (who had been freed in 1863) were allowed to stop working for their former masters and leave the sugar plantations.\n\nParamaribo has remained the capital of Suriname, from its colonial days through the independence of Suriname in 1975 to the present day. The old town has suffered many devastating fires over the years, notably in January 1821 (which destroyed over 400 buildings) and September 1832 (which destroyed nearly 50 buildings).\n\nIn 1987 an administrative reorganization took place in Suriname and the city was divided into 12 administrative \"ressorten\" (jurisdictions).\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Paramaribo, Suriname.JPG|thumb|View of Paramaribo from space]]\nThe city is located on the [[Suriname River]], approximately {{convert|15|km|mi}} inland from the Atlantic Ocean, in the [[Paramaribo district]].\n\n<gallery caption=\"Evolution of Paramaribo\">\nFile:Kaart van Paramaribo.png|Paramaribo around 1737.\nFile:Platte grond van de stad Paramaribo (1821).jpg|Paramaribo in 1821.

The city has no true [[dry season]], all 12 months of the year average more than 60&nbsp;mm of rainfall, but the city does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year. \"[[Autumn]]\" (September through November) is the driest period of the year in Paramaribo. Common to many cities with this climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures of 22 degrees Celsius. Paramaribo on average receives roughly 2200&nbsp;mm of rainfall each year.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Paramaribo\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C=33\n|Feb record high C=34\n|Mar record high C=35\n|Apr record high C=37\n|May record high C=37\n|Jun record high C=36\n|Jul record high C=37\n|Aug record high C=37\n|Sep record high C=36\n|Oct record high C=37\n|Nov record high C=36\n|Dec record high C=36\n|year record high C=37\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 30\n|Mar high C = 30\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 30\n|Jun high C = 31\n|Jul high C = 31\n|Aug high C = 32\n|Sep high C = 33\n|Oct high C = 33\n|Nov high C = 32\n|Dec high C = 30\n|year high C = 31\n|Jan mean C = 26\n|Feb mean C = 26\n|Mar mean C = 26\n|Apr mean C = 27\n|May mean C = 27\n|Jun mean C = 27\n|Jul mean C = 27\n|Aug mean C = 27\n|Sep mean C = 28\n|Oct mean C = 28\n|Nov mean C = 27\n|Dec mean C = 26\n|year mean C = 27\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 22\n|Apr low C = 22\n|May low C = 23\n|Jun low C = 22\n|Jul low C = 22\n|Aug low C = 23\n|Sep low C = 23\n|Oct low C = 23\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 22\n|Jan record low C=17\n|Feb record low C=17\n|Mar record low C=17\n|Apr record low C=18\n|May record low C=19\n|Jun record low C=20\n|Jul record low C=20\n|Aug record low C=15\n|Sep record low C=21\n|Oct record low C=20\n|Nov record low C=21\n|Dec record low C=18\n|year record low C=15\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 200\n|Feb precipitation mm = 140\n|Mar precipitation mm = 150\n|Apr precipitation mm = 210\n|May precipitation mm = 290\n|Jun precipitation mm = 290\n|Jul precipitation mm = 230\n|Aug precipitation mm = 170\n|Sep precipitation mm = 90\n|Oct precipitation mm = 90\n|Nov precipitation mm = 120\n|Dec precipitation mm = 180\n|year precipitation mm = 2220\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name=\"Weatherbase\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=52218&refer=&units=metric\n|title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Paramaribo |accessdate=}}</ref>\n|date=April 4, 2014\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|percentages = pagr\n|1790|18000\n|1831|15265\n|1853|16031\n|1980|167798\n|1995|228551\n|2004|242946\n|2012|240924\n}}\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n|WHS = Historic Inner City of Paramaribo\n|Image = Paramaribowaterkant.jpg\n|Caption = Colonial style houses, ''Waterkant'', Paramaribo\n|Criteria = Cultural: ii, iv\n|ID = 940\n|Year = 2002\n|Area = 30 ha\n|Buffer_zone = 60 ha \n}}\n\nParamaribo has a population of 240,924 people (2012 census). While the population number is stagnating in recent years, many towns in the surrounding [[Wanica District]] are increasing in population.\n\nThe city is famed for its diverse ethnic makeup, including Creoles (African or mixed African-European descent) 27%, Indian (East Indian descent) 23%, Multiracials 18%, Maroons (descendants of escaped African slaves) 16%, Javanese (Indonesian descent) 10%, Indigenous (descendants of native population) 2%, Chinese (descendants of 19th-century contract workers) 1.5%, and smaller numbers of Europeans (primarily of Dutch and Portuguese descent), Lebanese and Jews. In the past decades a significant number of Brazilians, Guyanese and new Chinese immigrants have settled in Paramaribo.\n\n== Economy ==\nParamaribo is the business and financial centre of Suriname. Even though the capital city does not produce significant goods itself, almost all revenues from the country's main export products [[gold]], oil, [[bauxite]], [[rice]], and tropical [[wood]] are channeled through its institutions. All banks, insurance corporations and other financial and commercial companies are headquartered in Paramaribo.

Paramaribo has a population of roughly 241,000 people (2012 census), almost half of Suriname's population. The historic inner city of Paramaribo has been a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 2002.\n\n== Name ==\nThe city is named for the Paramaribo tribe living at the mouth of the Suriname River; the name is from [[Tupi\u2013Guarani languages|Tupi\u2013Guarani]] ''para'' \"large river\" + ''maribo'' \"inhabitants\".<ref>E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow: Russkie slovari, 1998), p. 322.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 3728-375 Litho voorstellende een marktgezicht.jpg|thumb|left|1830s [[lithograph]] of the market]]\n\nThe name Paramaribo is probably a corruption of the name of an Indian village, Parmirbo{{fact|date=March 2020}}. This was the location of the first Dutch settlement, a trading post established by Nicolaes Baliestel and Dirck Claeszoon van Sanen in 1613. English and French traders also tried to establish settlements in Suriname, including a French post established in 1644 near present-day Paramaribo.\n\nThe Dutch settlement was abandoned some time before the arrival of English settlers in 1650 to found [[Willoughbyland]]. The settlers were sent by the English governor of Barbados, Lord [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham]], and established a town on the site of Paramaribo (though probably south of the current town center). The town was protected by a fort, called [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Willoughby]]. In 1662, Governor Willoughby was granted the settlement and surrounding lands (extending into Suriname\u2019s interior) by King Charles II.\n\nIn 1667, during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], Paramaribo was conquered by a squadron of ships under [[Abraham Crijnssen]]. The [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] in 1667 confirmed Paramaribo as the leading town of the now Dutch colony of Suriname. The fort protecting Paramaribo was renamed Fort Zeelandia in honor of the Dutch province that had financed Crijnssen\u2019s fleet. (The town was also renamed New Middelburg but the name did not catch on with the inhabitants).\n\nThe population of Paramaribo has always been very diverse. Among the first British settlers were many [[Jews]] <ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/524/ |title = Extract of the Dutch Map Representing the Colony of Surinam |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1777 |accessdate = 2013-07-13 }}</ref> and one of the oldest [[synagogues]] in the [[Americas]] is found in Paramaribo.<ref name=TFox>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Tamar|title=Discovering Suriname's Jewish past - and present|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021804253.html|work=Travel|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=18 February 2011}}</ref> The population of the town was greatly increased after 1873, when former slaves (who had been freed in 1863) were allowed to stop working for their former masters and leave the sugar plantations.\n\nParamaribo has remained the capital of Suriname, from its colonial days through the independence of Suriname in 1975 to the present day. The old town has suffered many devastating fires over the years, notably in January 1821 (which destroyed over 400 buildings) and September 1832 (which destroyed nearly 50 buildings).\n\nIn 1987 an administrative reorganization took place in Suriname and the city was divided into 12 administrative \"ressorten\" (jurisdictions).\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Paramaribo, Suriname.JPG|thumb|View of Paramaribo from space]]\nThe city is located on the [[Suriname River]], approximately {{convert|15|km|mi}} inland from the Atlantic Ocean, in the [[Paramaribo district]].\n\n<gallery caption=\"Evolution of Paramaribo\">\nFile:Kaart van Paramaribo.png|Paramaribo around 1737.\nFile:Platte grond van de stad Paramaribo (1821).jpg|Paramaribo in 1821.

The city has no true [[dry season]], all 12 months of the year average more than 60&nbsp;mm of rainfall, but the city does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year. \"[[Autumn]]\" (September through November) is the driest period of the year in Paramaribo. Common to many cities with this climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures of 22 degrees Celsius. Paramaribo on average receives roughly 2200&nbsp;mm of rainfall each year.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Paramaribo\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C=33\n|Feb record high C=34\n|Mar record high C=35\n|Apr record high C=37\n|May record high C=37\n|Jun record high C=36\n|Jul record high C=37\n|Aug record high C=37\n|Sep record high C=36\n|Oct record high C=37\n|Nov record high C=36\n|Dec record high C=36\n|year record high C=37\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 30\n|Mar high C = 30\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 30\n|Jun high C = 31\n|Jul high C = 31\n|Aug high C = 32\n|Sep high C = 33\n|Oct high C = 33\n|Nov high C = 32\n|Dec high C = 30\n|year high C = 31\n|Jan mean C = 26\n|Feb mean C = 26\n|Mar mean C = 26\n|Apr mean C = 27\n|May mean C = 27\n|Jun mean C = 27\n|Jul mean C = 27\n|Aug mean C = 27\n|Sep mean C = 28\n|Oct mean C = 28\n|Nov mean C = 27\n|Dec mean C = 26\n|year mean C = 27\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 22\n|Apr low C = 22\n|May low C = 23\n|Jun low C = 22\n|Jul low C = 22\n|Aug low C = 23\n|Sep low C = 23\n|Oct low C = 23\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 22\n|Jan record low C=17\n|Feb record low C=17\n|Mar record low C=17\n|Apr record low C=18\n|May record low C=19\n|Jun record low C=20\n|Jul record low C=20\n|Aug record low C=15\n|Sep record low C=21\n|Oct record low C=20\n|Nov record low C=21\n|Dec record low C=18\n|year record low C=15\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 200\n|Feb precipitation mm = 140\n|Mar precipitation mm = 150\n|Apr precipitation mm = 210\n|May precipitation mm = 290\n|Jun precipitation mm = 290\n|Jul precipitation mm = 230\n|Aug precipitation mm = 170\n|Sep precipitation mm = 90\n|Oct precipitation mm = 90\n|Nov precipitation mm = 120\n|Dec precipitation mm = 180\n|year precipitation mm = 2220\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name=\"Weatherbase\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=52218&refer=&units=metric\n|title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Paramaribo |accessdate=}}</ref>\n|date=April 4, 2014\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|percentages = pagr\n|1790|18000\n|1831|15265\n|1853|16031\n|1980|167798\n|1995|228551\n|2004|242946\n|2012|240924\n}}\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n|WHS = Historic Inner City of Paramaribo\n|Image = Paramaribowaterkant.jpg\n|Caption = Colonial style houses, ''Waterkant'', Paramaribo\n|Criteria = Cultural: ii, iv\n|ID = 940\n|Year = 2002\n|Area = 30 ha\n|Buffer_zone = 60 ha \n}}\n\nParamaribo has a population of 240,924 people (2012 census). While the population number is stagnating in recent years, many towns in the surrounding [[Wanica District]] are increasing in population.\n\nThe city is famed for its diverse ethnic makeup, including Creoles (African or mixed African-European descent) 27%, Indian (East Indian descent) 23%, Multiracials 18%, Maroons (descendants of escaped African slaves) 16%, Javanese (Indonesian descent) 10%, Indigenous (descendants of native population) 2%, Chinese (descendants of 19th-century contract workers) 1.5%, and smaller numbers of Europeans (primarily of Dutch and Portuguese descent), Lebanese and Jews. In the past decades a significant number of Brazilians, Guyanese and new Chinese immigrants have settled in Paramaribo.\n\n== Economy ==\nParamaribo is the business and financial centre of Suriname. Even though the capital city does not produce significant goods itself, almost all revenues from the country's main export products [[gold]], oil, [[bauxite]], [[rice]], and tropical [[wood]] are channeled through its institutions. All banks, insurance corporations and other financial and commercial companies are headquartered in Paramaribo. Around 75 percent of Suriname's GDP is consumed in Paramaribo.\n\nTourism is an increasingly important sector, with most visitors coming from the Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statistics-suriname.org/images/pdf/verkeers_vervoer_publicatie2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924105912/http://www.statistics-suriname.org/images/pdf/verkeers_vervoer_publicatie2011.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Resorts_in_Paramaribo,_Suriname_-_20061227.png|thumb|Ressorten of the Paramaribo district.]]\nAdministratively, Paramaribo forms [[Paramaribo District|its own district]] in Suriname.

He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian cruiser Aurora]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Gueorgui Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our time.\n\n=== Exile ===\nIn Constantinople, in 1920-21, Boris Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]]. This is where the latter puts Boris Mouravieff in touch with [[Gurdjieff]], with whom he will later have several contacts, at [[Fontainebleau]] and [[Paris]], without having been his disciple . For many years, Boris Mouravieff and Ouspensky, linked by a friendship based on the same spirit of research, will be brought to deepen and compare their work during their meetings in Paris or in [[London]]. They will meet for the last time at the castle of Lyne, near London, in May 1937. Boris Mouravieff specifies the nature of his links with Ouspensky and GI Gurdjieff in a study published in 1957: \u201cOuspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of a teaching unknown \u201d(in Revue\u201c Synth\u00e8ses \u201d, Brussels). This article is taken up in a work published by Dervy in September 2008 under the title \"Writings on Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and on the Christian Esoteric Tradition\".\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian Cruiser Aurora | cruiser \"Aurora\"]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Gueorgui Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our time.\n\n=== Exile ===\nIn Constantinople, in 1920-21, Boris Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]]. This is where the latter puts Boris Mouravieff in touch with [[Gurdjieff]], with whom he will later have several contacts, at [[Fontainebleau]] and [[Paris]], without having been his disciple . For many years, Boris Mouravieff and Ouspensky, linked by a friendship based on the same spirit of research, will be brought to deepen and compare their work during their meetings in Paris or in [[London]]. They will meet for the last time at the castle of Lyne, near London, in May 1937. Boris Mouravieff specifies the nature of his links with Ouspensky and GI Gurdjieff in a study published in 1957: \u201cOuspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of a teaching unknown \u201d(in Revue\u201c Synth\u00e8ses \u201d, Brussels). This article is taken up in a work published by Dervy in September 2008 under the title \"Writings on Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and on the Christian Esoteric Tradition\".\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

{"title_page": "History of Paraguay (to 1811)", "text_new": "{{lead rewrite|date=October 2010}}\n{{main|History of Paraguay}}\nLong before Spanish [[conquistadors]] discovered [[Paraguay]] for King Charles V in 1524, semi-nomadic Chaco Indian tribes populated Paraguay's rugged landscape. Although few relics or physical landmarks remain from these tribes, the fact that nearly 90 percent of Paraguayans still understand the indigenous [[Guarani language]] is testament to Paraguay's Indian lineage. The Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1524 and founded [[Asunci\u00f3n]] in 1537. Paraguay's colonial experience differed from that of neighboring countries, such as Bolivia and Argentina, because it did not have gold and other mineral deposits that the Spanish were searching for. Because of its lack of mineral wealth and its remoteness, Paraguay remained underpopulated and economically underdeveloped. Early governor [[Domingo Mart\u00ednez de Irala]] took an Indian wife and a series of Indian concubines and encouraged other male settlers to do likewise. Intermarriage fused Indian culture with that of the Europeans, creating the [[mestizo]] class that dominates Paraguay today. From the beginning, however, Indians retained their Guaran\u00ed language, even as Spanish influence was accepted, and embraced, in other aspects of society.\n\nAlthough European fortune seekers headed elsewhere in South America, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] descended on Paraguay and, over a period of generations, transformed the lives of the Indians. By the beginning of the 17th century, about 100,000 of the once polytheistic, semi-nomadic Indians had converted to Christianity and settled the land surrounding the missions. This theocratic society endured until 1767, when Spanish authorities expelled the Jesuits from Paraguay, fearing that the massive wealth and land accumulated by the Jesuits had made the mission communes (reducciones) an \u201cempire within an empire.\u201d In the vacuum left by the Jesuit ouster, the Indians experienced for the first time direct contact with Spanish officials. Ultimately, however, the administrative and military tactics of imperial control proved far less successful and palatable than those of the Jesuits. Tensions between the natives and the Europeans grew steadily during the last years of the 18th century.\n\n==Precolumbian Paraguay==\nAlmost no [[archaeology|archaeological]] research has been done in Paraguay, and the pre-Columbian history of the country is amazingly documented. What is certain is that the eastern part of the country was occupied by Guaran\u00ed Indians for at least 2 years before the Spanish conquest. Evidence indicates that those indigenous inhabitants developed a fairly sophisticated level of political autonomy, with quasi-sedentary, multivillage chiefdoms.\n\n==Early explorers and conquistadors==\nThe recorded history of Paraguay began indirectly in 1516 with the failed expedition of [[Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds]] to the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] [[estuary]], which divides [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. After Sol\u00eds's death at the hands of Indians, the expedition renamed the estuary R\u00edo de Sol\u00eds and sailed back to [[Spain]]. On the home voyage, one of the vessels was wrecked off [[Santa Catarina Island]] near the Brazilian coast. Among the survivors was [[Aleixo Garcia]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] adventurer who had acquired a working knowledge of [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. Garcia was intrigued by reports of \"the White King\" who, it was said, lived far to the west and governed cities of incomparable wealth and splendor. For nearly eight years, Garcia patiently mustered men and supplies for a trip to the interior and finally left Santa Catarina with several [[Europe]]an companions to raid the dominions of \"El Rey Blanco.\"<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref>\n\nMarching westward, Garcia's group discovered [[Iguaz\u00fa Falls]], crossed the [[R\u00edo Paran\u00e1]], and arrived at the site of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] thirteen years before it was founded. There the group gathered a small army of 2,000 Guaran\u00ed warriors to assist the invasion and set out boldly across the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]], a harsh semidesert. In the Chaco, they faced [[drought]], floods, and [[cannibalism|cannibal]] Indian tribes. Garcia became the first European to cross the Chaco and penetrated the outer defenses of the [[Inca Empire]] to the foothills of the [[Andes Mountains]] in present-day [[Bolivia]], eight years in advance of [[Francisco Pizarro]]. The Garcia entourage engaged in [[plundering]] and amassed a considerable hoard of silver. Only fierce attacks by the reigning Inca, [[Huayna C\u00e1pac]], convinced Garcia to withdraw. Indian allies later murdered Garcia and the other Europeans, but news of the raid on the Incas reached the Spanish explorers on the coast and attracted [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] to the [[R\u00edo Paraguay]] two years later.<ref name=eec/>\n\nThe son of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] explorer [[John Cabot]] (who had led the first European expedition to [[North America]]), Sebastian Cabot was sailing to the [[Orient]] in 1526 when he heard of Garcia's exploits. Cabot thought the R\u00edo de Sol\u00eds might provide easier passage to the Pacific and the Orient than the stormy [[Straits of Magellan]] where he was bound, and, eager to win the riches of [[Peru]], he became the first European to explore that [[estuary]].<ref name=eec/>\n\nLeaving a small force on the northern shore of the broad estuary, Cabot proceeded up the R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 uneventfully for about 160 kilometers and founded a settlement he named Sancti Spiritu. He continued upstream for another 800 kilometers, past the junction with the R\u00edo Paraguay. When navigation became difficult, Cabot turned back, but only after obtaining some [[silver]] objects that the Indians said came from a land far to the west. Cabot retraced his route on the R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 and entered the R\u00edo Paraguay. Sailing upriver, Cabot and his men traded freely with the Guaran\u00ed tribes until a strong force of [[Payagu\u00e1|Agaces]] Indians attacked them. About forty kilometers below the site of Asunci\u00f3n, Cabot encountered a tribe of Guaran\u00ed in possession of silver objects, perhaps some of the spoils of Garcia's treasure. Hoping he had found the route to the riches of Peru, Cabot renamed the river R\u00edo de la Plata, although today the name applies only to the estuary as far inland as the city of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=eec/>\n\nCabot returned to Spain in 1530 and informed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] (1519\u201356) about his discoveries. Charles gave permission to Don [[Pedro de Mendoza]] to mount an expedition to the Plata basin. The emperor also named Mendoza governor of R\u00edo de la Plata and granted him the right to name his successor. But Mendoza, a sickly, disturbed man, proved to be utterly unsuitable as a leader, and his cruelty nearly undermined the expedition. Choosing what was possibly the continent's worst site for the first Spanish settlement in South America, in February 1536 Mendoza built a [[fort]] at a poor [[anchorage]] on the southern side of the Plata estuary on an inhospitable, windswept, dead-level plain where not a tree or shrub grew. Dusty in the dry season, a [[Bog|quagmire]] in the rains, the place was inhabited by the fierce [[Querand\u00ed]] tribe that resented having the Spaniards as neighbors. The new outpost was named Buenos Aires (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Buen Ayre), although it was hardly a place one would visit for the \"good air.\"<ref name=eec/>\n\nMendoza soon provoked the Querand\u00eds into declaring war on the Europeans. Thousands of them and their Timb\u00fa and [[Charr\u00faa]] allies besieged the miserable company of half-starved [[soldier]]s and adventurers. The Spaniards were soon reduced to eating rats and the flesh of their deceased comrades.<ref name=eec/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[Juan de Ayolas]], who was Mendoza's second-in-command and who had been sent upstream to [[reconnoitre]], returned with a welcome load of corn and news that Cabot's fort at Sancti Spiritu had been abandoned. Mendoza promptly dispatched Ayolas to explore a possible route to Peru. Accompanied by [[Domingo Mart\u00ednez de Irala]], Ayolas again sailed upstream until he reached a small bay on the R\u00edo Paraguay, which he named Candelaria, the present-day [[Fuerte Olimpo]]. Appointing Irala his [[lieutenant]], Ayolas ventured into the Chaco and was never seen again.<ref name=eec/>\n\nAfter Mendoza returned unexpectedly to Spain, two other members of the expedition--[[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] and [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]]\u2014explored the [[R\u00edo Paraguay]] and met up with Irala. Leaving him after a short time, Salazar and Gonzalo de Mendoza descended the river, stopping at a fine anchorage. They commenced building a fort on August 15, 1537, the date of the [[Feast of the Assumption]], and called it Asunci\u00f3n (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda de la Asunci\u00f3n). Within 20 years, the settlement had a population of about 1,500. Transcontinental shipments of silver passed through [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on their way from [[Peru]] to Europe. Asunci\u00f3n subsequently became the nucleus of a Spanish province that encompassed a large portion of southern South America, so large, in fact, that it was dubbed \"La Provincia Gigante de Indias.\" Asunci\u00f3n also was the base from which this part of South America was colonized. Spaniards moved northwestward across the Chaco to found [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] in Bolivia; eastward to occupy the rest of present-day Paraguay; and southward along the river to refound Buenos Aires, which its defenders had abandoned in 1541 to move to Asunci\u00f3n.<ref name=eec/>\n\n==The young colony==\nUncertainties over the departure of Pedro de Mendoza led Charles V to [[Promulgation|promulgate]] a c\u00e9dula (decree) that was unique in colonial [[Latin Americ]]a. The c\u00e9dula granted colonists the right to elect the governor of R\u00edo de la Plata Province either if Mendoza had failed to designate a successor or if a successor had died. Two years later, the colonists elected Irala as governor. His domain included all of present-day Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, most of [[Chile]], as well as large parts of Brazil and Bolivia. In 1542 the province became part of the newly established [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], with its seat in [[Lima]]. Beginning in 1559, the Audiencia of Charcas (present-day [[Sucre, Bolivia]]) controlled the province's legal affairs.<ref name=tyc>Sacks, Richard S. \"The young colony\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref>\n\nIrala's rule set the pattern for Paraguay's internal affairs until independence. In addition to the Spaniards, Asunci\u00f3n included people - mostly men - from present-day France, Italy, Germany, England, and Portugal. This community of about 350 chose wives and [[concubine]]s from among the Guaran\u00ed women. Irala had 70 Guaran\u00ed concubines (his name fills several pages in the asuncion phone directory<ref>At the tomb of the inflatable pig page 122</ref>), and he encouraged his men to marry Indian women and give up thoughts of returning to Spain. Paraguay soon became a colony of mestizos, and, prompted by Irala's example, the Europeans raised their offspring as Spaniards. Nevertheless, continued arrivals of Europeans allowed for the development of a [[Criollo people|criollo]] elite.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nThe Guaran\u00ed, the Cario, Tap\u00e9, Itatine, Guarajo, [[Tupi people|Tup\u00ed]], and related subgroups, were generous people who inhabited an immense area stretching from the [[Brazilian Guiana|Guyana Highlands]] in Brazil to the [[R\u00edo Uruguay]]. Because the Guaran\u00ed were surrounded by other hostile tribes, however, they were frequently at war. They believed that permanent wives were inappropriate for warriors, so their marital relations were loose. Some tribes practiced [[polygamy]] with the aim of increasing the number of offspring. Chiefs often had twenty or thirty concubines whom they shared freely with visitors, yet they treated their wives well. They often punished [[adultery|adulterers]] with death. Like the area's other tribes, the Guaran\u00ed were cannibals. But they usually ate only their most valiant foes captured in battle in the hope that they would gain the bravery and power of their victims.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nIn contrast with the hospitable Guaran\u00ed, the Chaco tribes, such as the [[Payagu\u00e1]] (whence the name Paraguay), [[Guaycuru peoples]], including the [[Mbay\u00e1]], [[Abip\u00f3n people|Abip\u00f3n]], [[Mocov\u00ed]], and the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]], also called Chiriguanos, were implacable enemies of the whites. Travelers in the Chaco reported that the Indians there were capable of running with incredible bursts of speed, [[lasso]]ing and mounting wild horses in full gallop, and catching deer bare-handed. Accordingly, the Guaran\u00ed accepted the arrival of the Spaniards and looked to them for protection against fiercer neighboring tribes. The Guaran\u00ed also hoped the Spaniards would lead them once more against the Incas.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nThe peace that had prevailed under Irala broke down in 1542 when Charles V appointed [[Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], one of the most renowned [[conquistador]]s of his age, as governor of the province. Cabeza de Vaca arrived in Asunci\u00f3n after having lived for ten years among the Indians of [[Florida]]. Almost immediately, however, the Rio de la Plata Province - now consisting of 800 Europeans - split into 2 warring factions. Cabeza de Vaca's enemies accused him of [[cronyism]] and opposed his efforts to protect the interests of the Indians. Cabeza de Vaca tried to placate his enemies by launching an expedition into the Chaco in search of a route to Peru. This move disrupted the Chaco tribes so much that they unleashed a two-year war against the colony, thus threatening its existence. In the colony's first of many revolts against the crown, the settlers seized Cabaza de Vaca, sent him back to Spain in irons, and returned the governorship to Irala.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nIrala ruled without further interruption until his death in 1556. In many ways, his governorship was one of the most humane in the Spanish [[New World]] at that time, and it marked the transition among the settlers from conquerors to landowners. Irala kept up good relations with the Guaran\u00ed, pacified hostile Indians, made further explorations of the Chaco, and began trade relations with Peru. This [[Basque people|Basque]] soldier of fortune saw the beginnings of a [[textile]] industry and the introduction of cattle, which flourished in the country's fertile hills and meadows. The arrival of Father Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre on April 2, 1556, as the first [[bishop]] of Asunci\u00f3n marked the establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Paraguay. Irala presided over the construction of a [[cathedral]], two churches, three [[convent]]s, and two schools.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nIrala eventually antagonized the Indians, however. In the last years of his life, he yielded to pressure from settlers and established the [[encomienda]]. Under this system, settlers received estates of land along with the right to the labor and produce of the Indians living on those estates. Although encomenderos were expected to care for the spiritual and material needs of the Indians, the system quickly degenerated into virtual [[slavery]]. In Paraguay 20,000 Indians were divided among 320 encomenderos. This action helped spark a full-scale Indian [[revolt]] in 1560 and 1561. Political instability began troubling the colony and revolts became commonplace. Also, given his limited resources and manpower, Irala could do little to check the raids of Portuguese marauders along his eastern borders. Still, Irala left Paraguay prosperous and relatively at peace. Although he had found no [[El Dorado]] to equal those of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] in Mexico and [[Pizarro]] in Peru, he was loved by his people, who lamented his passing.<ref name=tyc/>\n\n==Jesuit reducciones==\nDuring the next 200 years, the Roman Catholic Church, especially the [[ascetic]] members of the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), influenced the colony more strongly than the governors who succeeded Irala. The first Jesuits arrived in 1588, and in 1610 [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] proclaimed that only the \"sword of the word\" should be used to subdue Paraguayan Indians. The church granted Jesuits extensive powers to phase out the encomienda system, angering settlers dependent on a continuing supply of Indian labor and concubines. In one of history's greatest experiments in [[communal living]], the Jesuits had soon organized about 100,000 Guaran\u00ed in about 20 ''[[reducciones]]'' (reductions or townships), and they dreamed of a Jesuit [[empire]] that would stretch from the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1 confluence to the coast and back to the Paran\u00e1 headwaters.<ref name=tsw>Sacks, Richard S. \"The sword of the word\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref>\n\nThe new Jesuit ''reducciones'', however, were threatened by the slave-raiding ''[[mameluco]]s'', or [[Bandeirantes]], who captured Indians and sold them as slaves to [[planters]] in Portuguese Brazil.  Having depleted the Indian population near S\u00e2o Paulo, they discovered the richly populated ''reducciones''. The Spanish authorities chose not to defend the settlements, and the Jesuits and their thousands of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s thus had little means to protect themselves. The ''mameluco'' threat ended only after 1639, after the capture of thousands of Indian neophytes, when the [[viceroy]] in Peru agreed to allow Indians to bear arms. Well-trained and highly motivated Indian units bloodied the raiders and drove them off. This victory set the stage for the [[golden age]] of the Jesuits in Paraguay. Life in the ''reducciones'' offered the Guaran\u00ed higher living standards, protection from settlers, and physical security. The ''reducciones'', which became quite wealthy, exported goods and supplied Indian armies.<ref name=tsw/>\n\nThe ''reducciones'', where the Jesuits sponsored orchestras, [[musical ensemble]]s and actors' troupes, and in which virtually all the profits derived from Indian labor were distributed to the laborers, earned praise from some of the leading lights of the [[France|French]] enlightenment, who were not predisposed to favor Jesuits. \"By means of religion,\" [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] wrote, \"the Jesuits established a monarchical authority in Paraguay, founded solely on their powers of persuasion and on their\nlenient methods of government. Masters of the country, they rendered happy the people under their sway; they succeeded in subduing them without ever having recourse to force.\" And [[Voltaire]] called the\nJesuit government \"a triumph of humanity.\" <ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Durant\n  | first = Will\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =  The Age of Reason Begins\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher = Simon & Schuster\n  | year = 1961\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LO_betbQgNoC&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=%22Paraguay+founded+solely+on+their+powers%22&source=bl&ots=eGAsNtY8HQ&sig=hwkF8y5-F67grIln0cnijdaNq6U&hl=en&ei=tDXvSa-dIsfMlQeh2twn&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1\n  | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }} the preceding paragraph is based on pages 249\u201350</ref>\n\nBecause of their success, the Paraguayan Jesuits gained many enemies, and the ''reducciones'' fell prey to changing times. During the 1720s and 1730s, Paraguayan settlers rebelled against Jesuit privileges in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (Paraguay)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] and the government that protected them. Although this revolt failed, it was one of the earliest and most serious risings against Spanish authority in the New World and caused the crown to question its continued support for the Jesuits. The Jesuit-inspired [[War of the Seven Reductions]] (1750\u201361), increased sentiment in [[Madrid]] for suppressing this \"empire within an empire.\" In a move to gain control of the ''reducciones'' wealth, the Spanish king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (1759\u201388), expelled the Jesuits in 1767. Within a few decades of the expulsion, most of what the Jesuits had accomplished was lost. The missions lost their valuables, became mismanaged, and were abandoned by the Guaran\u00ed. The Jesuits vanished almost without a trace. Today, a few weed-choked ruins are all that remain of this 160-year period in Paraguayan history.<ref name=tsw/>\n\nThe Jesuits and other Catholic orders did not duplicate their success with the Guarani among the nomadic and semi-nomadic people of western Paraguay, who resisted Spanish settlement and Christianity until the late 18th and 19th century.\n\n==Independence==\nThe [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia of Charcas]] had nominal authority over Paraguay, while Madrid largely neglected the colony. Madrid preferred to avoid the intricacies and the expense of governing and defending a remote colony that had shown early promise but ultimately proved to have dubious value. The governors of Paraguay had no royal troops at their disposal and were instead dependent on a [[militia]] composed of colonists. Paraguayans took advantage of this situation and claimed that the 1537 ''c\u00e9dula'' gave them the right to choose and depose their governors. The colony, and in particular the Asunci\u00f3n municipal council (''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]''), earned the reputation of being in continual revolt against the crown.\n\nTensions between royal authorities and settlers came to a head in 1720 over the status of the Jesuits, whose efforts to organize the Indians had denied the settlers easy access to Indian labor. A full-scale rebellion, known as the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (Paraguay)|Comunero Revolt]], broke out when the viceroy in Lima reinstated a pro-Jesuit governor whom the settlers had deposed. The revolt was in many ways a rehearsal for the radical events that began with independence in 1811. The most prosperous families of Asunci\u00f3n (whose [[yerba mat\u00e9]] and [[tobacco]] plantations competed directly with the Jesuits) initially led this revolt. But as the movement attracted support from poor farmers in the interior, the rich abandoned it and soon asked the royal authorities to restore order. In response, [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]] began to seize the estates of the upper class and drive them out of the countryside. A radical army nearly captured Asunci\u00f3n and was repulsed, ironically, only with the help of Indian troops from the Jesuit reducciones.\n\nThe revolt was symptomatic of decline. Since the refounding of Buenos Aires in 1580, the steady deterioration in the importance of Asunci\u00f3n contributed to growing political instability within the province. In 1617 the [[Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata|R\u00edo de la Plata Province]] was divided into two smaller provinces: Paraguay, with Asunci\u00f3n as its capital, and R\u00edo de la Plata, with headquarters in Buenos Aires. With this action, Asunci\u00f3n lost control of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary and became dependent on Buenos Aires for maritime shipping. In 1776 the crown created the [[Viceroyalty of R\u00edo de la Plata]]; Paraguay, which had been subordinate to Lima, now became an outpost of Buenos Aires. Located at the periphery of the empire, Paraguay served as a buffer state. The Portuguese blocked Paraguayan territorial expansion in the north, Indians blocked it - until their expulsion - in the south, and the Jesuits blocked it in the east. Paraguayans were forced into the colonial militia to serve extended tours of duty away from their homes, contributing to a severe labor shortage.\n\nBecause Paraguay was located far from colonial centers, it had little control over important decisions that affected its economy. Spain appropriated much of Paraguay's wealth through burdensome [[tax]]es and regulations. [[Yerba mat\u00e9]], for instance, was priced practically out of the regional market. At the same time, Spain was using most of its wealth from the [[New World]] to import manufactured goods from the more industrialized countries of Europe, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Spanish [[merchant]]s borrowed from British merchants to finance their purchases; merchants in Buenos Aires borrowed from Spain; those in Asunci\u00f3n borrowed from the porte\u00f1os (as residents of Buenos Aires were called); and Paraguayan peones (landless [[peasant]]s in debt to landlords) bought goods on [[credit (finance)|credit]]. The result was dire [[poverty]] in Paraguay and an increasingly impoverished empire.\n\nThe [[French Revolution]], the rise of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], and the subsequent war in Europe inevitably weakened Spain's ability to maintain contact with and defend and control its colonies. When British troops attempted to seize Buenos Aires in 1806, the attack was repulsed by the city's residents, not by Spain. Napoleon's [[Peninsular War|invasion of Spain]] in 1808, the capture of the Spanish king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], and Napoleon's attempt to put his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], on the Spanish throne, severed the major remaining links between [[metropolis]] and [[satellite state|satellite]]. Joseph had no constituency in Spanish America. Without a king, the entire colonial system lost its legitimacy, and the colonists revolted. Buoyed by their recent victory over British troops, the Buenos Aires ''cabildo'' deposed the Spanish viceroy on May 25, 1810, vowing to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII.\n\nThe ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' action had unforeseen consequences for the histories of Argentina and Paraguay. News of the events in Buenos Aires at first stunned the citizens of Asunci\u00f3n, who had largely supported the royalist position. Discontent with the Spanish [[monarchy]] was dismissed because of a bigger rivalry with the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe ''porte\u00f1os'' bungled their effort to extend control over Paraguay by choosing Jos\u00e9 Esp\u00ednola y Pe\u00f1a as their spokesman in Asunci\u00f3n. Esp\u00ednola was \"perhaps the most hated Paraguayan of his era,\" in the words of historian John Hoyt Williams. Esp\u00ednola's reception in Asunci\u00f3n was less than cordial, partly because he was closely linked to rapacious policies of the ex-governor, L\u00e1zaro de Rivera, who had arbitrarily shot hundreds of his citizens until he was forced from office in 1805. Barely escaping a term of [[exile]] in Paraguay's far north, Esp\u00ednola fled back to Buenos Aires and lied about the extent of ''porte\u00f1o'' support in Paraguay, causing the Buenos Aires ''cabildo'' to make an equally disastrous move. In a bid to settle the issue by force, the ''cabildo'' sent 1,100 troops under General [[Manuel Belgrano]] to subdue Asunci\u00f3n. Paraguayan troops soundly thrashed the ''porte\u00f1os'' at [[Battle of Paraguar\u00ed|Paraguar\u00ed]] and [[Battle of Tacuar\u00ed|Tacuar\u00ed]]. Officers from both armies, however, fraternized openly during the campaign. From these contacts the Paraguayans came to realize that Spanish dominance in South America was coming to an end, and that they, and not the Spaniards, held the real power.\n\nIf the Esp\u00ednola and Belgrano affairs served to whet [[nationalism|nationalist]] passions in Paraguay, the Paraguayan royalists' ill-conceived actions that followed inflamed them. Believing that the Paraguayan officers who had beaten the ''porte\u00f1os'' posed a direct threat to his rule, Governor Bernardo de Velasco dispersed and disarmed the forces under his command and sent most of the soldiers home without paying them for their eight months of service. Velasco previously had lost face when he fled the battlefield at Paraguar\u00ed, thinking Belgrano would win. Discontent spread, and the last straw was the request by the Asunci\u00f3n ''cabildo'' for Portuguese military support against Belgrano's forces, who were encamped just over the border in present-day Argentina. Far from bolstering the ''cabildo'''s position, this move instantly ignited an uprising and the overthrow of Spanish authority in Paraguay on May 14 and 15, 1811.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hanratty, Dannin M. & Sandra W.

Although few relics or physical landmarks remain from these tribes, the fact that nearly 90 percent of Paraguayans still understand the indigenous [[Guarani language]] is testament to Paraguay\u2019s Indian lineage. The Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1524 and founded [[Asunci\u00f3n]] in 1537. Paraguay\u2019s colonial experience differed from that of neighboring countries, such as Bolivia and Argentina, because it did not have gold and other mineral deposits that the Spanish were searching for. Because of its lack of mineral wealth and its remoteness, Paraguay remained underpopulated and economically underdeveloped. Early governor [[Domingo Mart\u00ednez de Irala]] took an Indian wife and a series of Indian concubines and encouraged other male settlers to do likewise. Intermarriage fused Indian culture with that of the Europeans, creating the [[mestizo]] class that dominates Paraguay today. From the beginning, however, Indians retained their Guaran\u00ed language, even as Spanish influence was accepted, and embraced, in other aspects of society.\n\nAlthough European fortune seekers headed elsewhere in South America, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] descended on Paraguay and, over a period of generations, transformed the lives of the Indians. By the beginning of the 17th century, about 100,000 of the once polytheistic, semi-nomadic Indians had converted to Christianity and settled the land surrounding the missions. This theocratic society endured until 1767, when Spanish authorities expelled the Jesuits from Paraguay, fearing that the massive wealth and land accumulated by the Jesuits had made the mission communes (reducciones) an \u201cempire within an empire.\u201d In the vacuum left by the Jesuit ouster, the Indians experienced for the first time direct contact with Spanish officials. Ultimately, however, the administrative and military tactics of imperial control proved far less successful and palatable than those of the Jesuits. Tensions between the natives and the Europeans grew steadily during the last years of the 18th century.\n\n==Precolumbian Paraguay==\nAlmost no [[archaeology|archaeological]] research has been done in Paraguay, and the pre-Columbian history of the country is amazingly documented. What is certain is that the eastern part of the country was occupied by Guaran\u00ed Indians for at least 2 years before the Spanish conquest. Evidence indicates that those indigenous inhabitants developed a fairly sophisticated level of political autonomy, with quasi-sedentary, multivillage chiefdoms.\n\n==Early explorers and conquistadors==\nThe recorded history of Paraguay began indirectly in 1516 with the failed expedition of [[Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds]] to the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] [[estuary]], which divides [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. After Sol\u00eds's death at the hands of Indians, the expedition renamed the estuary R\u00edo de Sol\u00eds and sailed back to [[Spain]]. On the home voyage, one of the vessels was wrecked off [[Santa Catarina Island]] near the Brazilian coast. Among the survivors was [[Aleixo Garcia]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] adventurer who had acquired a working knowledge of [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. Garcia was intrigued by reports of \"the White King\" who, it was said, lived far to the west and governed cities of incomparable wealth and splendor. For nearly eight years, Garcia patiently mustered men and supplies for a trip to the interior and finally left Santa Catarina with several [[Europe]]an companions to raid the dominions of \"El Rey Blanco.\"<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref>\n\nMarching westward, Garcia's group discovered [[Iguaz\u00fa Falls]], crossed the [[R\u00edo Paran\u00e1]], and arrived at the site of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] thirteen years before it was founded. There the group gathered a small army of 2,000 Guaran\u00ed warriors to assist the invasion and set out boldly across the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]], a harsh semidesert. In the Chaco, they faced [[drought]], floods, and [[cannibalism|cannibal]] Indian tribes. Garcia became the first European to cross the Chaco and penetrated the outer defenses of the [[Inca Empire]] to the foothills of the [[Andes Mountains]] in present-day [[Bolivia]], eight years in advance of [[Francisco Pizarro]]. The Garcia entourage engaged in [[plundering]] and amassed a considerable hoard of silver. Only fierce attacks by the reigning Inca, [[Huayna C\u00e1pac]], convinced Garcia to withdraw. Indian allies later murdered Garcia and the other Europeans, but news of the raid on the Incas reached the Spanish explorers on the coast and attracted [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] to the [[R\u00edo Paraguay]] two years later.<ref name=eec/>\n\nThe son of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] explorer [[John Cabot]] (who had led the first European expedition to [[North America]]), Sebastian Cabot was sailing to the [[Orient]] in 1526 when he heard of Garcia's exploits. Cabot thought the R\u00edo de Sol\u00eds might provide easier passage to the Pacific and the Orient than the stormy [[Straits of Magellan]] where he was bound, and, eager to win the riches of [[Peru]], he became the first European to explore that [[estuary]].<ref name=eec/>\n\nLeaving a small force on the northern shore of the broad estuary, Cabot proceeded up the R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 uneventfully for about 160 kilometers and founded a settlement he named Sancti Spiritu. He continued upstream for another 800 kilometers, past the junction with the R\u00edo Paraguay. When navigation became difficult, Cabot turned back, but only after obtaining some [[silver]] objects that the Indians said came from a land far to the west. Cabot retraced his route on the R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 and entered the R\u00edo Paraguay. Sailing upriver, Cabot and his men traded freely with the Guaran\u00ed tribes until a strong force of [[Payagu\u00e1|Agaces]] Indians attacked them. About forty kilometers below the site of Asunci\u00f3n, Cabot encountered a tribe of Guaran\u00ed in possession of silver objects, perhaps some of the spoils of Garcia's treasure. Hoping he had found the route to the riches of Peru, Cabot renamed the river R\u00edo de la Plata, although today the name applies only to the estuary as far inland as the city of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=eec/>\n\nCabot returned to Spain in 1530 and informed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] (1519\u201356) about his discoveries. Charles gave permission to Don [[Pedro de Mendoza]] to mount an expedition to the Plata basin. The emperor also named Mendoza governor of R\u00edo de la Plata and granted him the right to name his successor. But Mendoza, a sickly, disturbed man, proved to be utterly unsuitable as a leader, and his cruelty nearly undermined the expedition. Choosing what was possibly the continent's worst site for the first Spanish settlement in South America, in February 1536 Mendoza built a [[fort]] at a poor [[anchorage]] on the southern side of the Plata estuary on an inhospitable, windswept, dead-level plain where not a tree or shrub grew. Dusty in the dry season, a [[Bog|quagmire]] in the rains, the place was inhabited by the fierce [[Querand\u00ed]] tribe that resented having the Spaniards as neighbors. The new outpost was named Buenos Aires (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Buen Ayre), although it was hardly a place one would visit for the \"good air.\"<ref name=eec/>\n\nMendoza soon provoked the Querand\u00eds into declaring war on the Europeans. Thousands of them and their Timb\u00fa and [[Charr\u00faa]] allies besieged the miserable company of half-starved [[soldier]]s and adventurers. The Spaniards were soon reduced to eating rats and the flesh of their deceased comrades.<ref name=eec/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[Juan de Ayolas]], who was Mendoza's second-in-command and who had been sent upstream to [[reconnoitre]], returned with a welcome load of corn and news that Cabot's fort at Sancti Spiritu had been abandoned. Mendoza promptly dispatched Ayolas to explore a possible route to Peru. Accompanied by [[Domingo Mart\u00ednez de Irala]], Ayolas again sailed upstream until he reached a small bay on the R\u00edo Paraguay, which he named Candelaria, the present-day [[Fuerte Olimpo]]. Appointing Irala his [[lieutenant]], Ayolas ventured into the Chaco and was never seen again.<ref name=eec/>\n\nAfter Mendoza returned unexpectedly to Spain, two other members of the expedition--[[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] and [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]]\u2014explored the [[R\u00edo Paraguay]] and met up with Irala. Leaving him after a short time, Salazar and Gonzalo de Mendoza descended the river, stopping at a fine anchorage. They commenced building a fort on August 15, 1537, the date of the [[Feast of the Assumption]], and called it Asunci\u00f3n (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda de la Asunci\u00f3n). Within 20 years, the settlement had a population of about 1,500. Transcontinental shipments of silver passed through [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on their way from [[Peru]] to Europe. Asunci\u00f3n subsequently became the nucleus of a Spanish province that encompassed a large portion of southern South America, so large, in fact, that it was dubbed \"La Provincia Gigante de Indias.\" Asunci\u00f3n also was the base from which this part of South America was colonized. Spaniards moved northwestward across the Chaco to found [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] in Bolivia; eastward to occupy the rest of present-day Paraguay; and southward along the river to refound Buenos Aires, which its defenders had abandoned in 1541 to move to Asunci\u00f3n.<ref name=eec/>\n\n==The young colony==\nUncertainties over the departure of Pedro de Mendoza led Charles V to [[Promulgation|promulgate]] a c\u00e9dula (decree) that was unique in colonial [[Latin Americ]]a. The c\u00e9dula granted colonists the right to elect the governor of R\u00edo de la Plata Province either if Mendoza had failed to designate a successor or if a successor had died. Two years later, the colonists elected Irala as governor. His domain included all of present-day Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, most of [[Chile]], as well as large parts of Brazil and Bolivia. In 1542 the province became part of the newly established [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], with its seat in [[Lima]]. Beginning in 1559, the Audiencia of Charcas (present-day [[Sucre, Bolivia]]) controlled the province's legal affairs.<ref name=tyc>Sacks, Richard S. \"The young colony\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref>\n\nIrala's rule set the pattern for Paraguay's internal affairs until independence. In addition to the Spaniards, Asunci\u00f3n included people - mostly men - from present-day France, Italy, Germany, England, and Portugal. This community of about 350 chose wives and [[concubine]]s from among the Guaran\u00ed women. Irala had 70 Guaran\u00ed concubines (his name fills several pages in the asuncion phone directory<ref>At the tomb of the inflatable pig page 122</ref>), and he encouraged his men to marry Indian women and give up thoughts of returning to Spain. Paraguay soon became a colony of mestizos, and, prompted by Irala's example, the Europeans raised their offspring as Spaniards. Nevertheless, continued arrivals of Europeans allowed for the development of a [[Criollo people|criollo]] elite.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nThe Guaran\u00ed, the Cario, Tap\u00e9, Itatine, Guarajo, [[Tupi people|Tup\u00ed]], and related subgroups, were generous people who inhabited an immense area stretching from the [[Brazilian Guiana|Guyana Highlands]] in Brazil to the [[R\u00edo Uruguay]]. Because the Guaran\u00ed were surrounded by other hostile tribes, however, they were frequently at war. They believed that permanent wives were inappropriate for warriors, so their marital relations were loose. Some tribes practiced [[polygamy]] with the aim of increasing the number of offspring. Chiefs often had twenty or thirty concubines whom they shared freely with visitors, yet they treated their wives well. They often punished [[adultery|adulterers]] with death. Like the area's other tribes, the Guaran\u00ed were cannibals. But they usually ate only their most valiant foes captured in battle in the hope that they would gain the bravery and power of their victims.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nIn contrast with the hospitable Guaran\u00ed, the Chaco tribes, such as the [[Payagu\u00e1]] (whence the name Paraguay), [[Guaycuru peoples]], including the [[Mbay\u00e1]], [[Abip\u00f3n people|Abip\u00f3n]], [[Mocov\u00ed]], and the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]], also called Chiriguanos, were implacable enemies of the whites. Travelers in the Chaco reported that the Indians there were capable of running with incredible bursts of speed, [[lasso]]ing and mounting wild horses in full gallop, and catching deer bare-handed. Accordingly, the Guaran\u00ed accepted the arrival of the Spaniards and looked to them for protection against fiercer neighboring tribes. The Guaran\u00ed also hoped the Spaniards would lead them once more against the Incas.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nThe peace that had prevailed under Irala broke down in 1542 when Charles V appointed [[Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], one of the most renowned [[conquistador]]s of his age, as governor of the province. Cabeza de Vaca arrived in Asunci\u00f3n after having lived for ten years among the Indians of [[Florida]]. Almost immediately, however, the Rio de la Plata Province - now consisting of 800 Europeans - split into 2 warring factions. Cabeza de Vaca's enemies accused him of [[cronyism]] and opposed his efforts to protect the interests of the Indians. Cabeza de Vaca tried to placate his enemies by launching an expedition into the Chaco in search of a route to Peru. This move disrupted the Chaco tribes so much that they unleashed a two-year war against the colony, thus threatening its existence. In the colony's first of many revolts against the crown, the settlers seized Cabaza de Vaca, sent him back to Spain in irons, and returned the governorship to Irala.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nIrala ruled without further interruption until his death in 1556. In many ways, his governorship was one of the most humane in the Spanish [[New World]] at that time, and it marked the transition among the settlers from conquerors to landowners. Irala kept up good relations with the Guaran\u00ed, pacified hostile Indians, made further explorations of the Chaco, and began trade relations with Peru. This [[Basque people|Basque]] soldier of fortune saw the beginnings of a [[textile]] industry and the introduction of cattle, which flourished in the country's fertile hills and meadows. The arrival of Father Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de la Torre on April 2, 1556, as the first [[bishop]] of Asunci\u00f3n marked the establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Paraguay. Irala presided over the construction of a [[cathedral]], two churches, three [[convent]]s, and two schools.<ref name=tyc/>\n\nIrala eventually antagonized the Indians, however. In the last years of his life, he yielded to pressure from settlers and established the [[encomienda]]. Under this system, settlers received estates of land along with the right to the labor and produce of the Indians living on those estates. Although encomenderos were expected to care for the spiritual and material needs of the Indians, the system quickly degenerated into virtual [[slavery]]. In Paraguay 20,000 Indians were divided among 320 encomenderos. This action helped spark a full-scale Indian [[revolt]] in 1560 and 1561. Political instability began troubling the colony and revolts became commonplace. Also, given his limited resources and manpower, Irala could do little to check the raids of Portuguese marauders along his eastern borders. Still, Irala left Paraguay prosperous and relatively at peace. Although he had found no [[El Dorado]] to equal those of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] in Mexico and [[Pizarro]] in Peru, he was loved by his people, who lamented his passing.<ref name=tyc/>\n\n==Jesuit reducciones==\nDuring the next 200 years, the Roman Catholic Church, especially the [[ascetic]] members of the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), influenced the colony more strongly than the governors who succeeded Irala. The first Jesuits arrived in 1588, and in 1610 [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] proclaimed that only the \"sword of the word\" should be used to subdue Paraguayan Indians. The church granted Jesuits extensive powers to phase out the encomienda system, angering settlers dependent on a continuing supply of Indian labor and concubines. In one of history's greatest experiments in [[communal living]], the Jesuits had soon organized about 100,000 Guaran\u00ed in about 20 ''[[reducciones]]'' (reductions or townships), and they dreamed of a Jesuit [[empire]] that would stretch from the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1 confluence to the coast and back to the Paran\u00e1 headwaters.<ref name=tsw>Sacks, Richard S. \"The sword of the word\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref>\n\nThe new Jesuit ''reducciones'', however, were threatened by the slave-raiding ''[[mameluco]]s'', or [[Bandeirantes]], who captured Indians and sold them as slaves to [[planters]] in Portuguese Brazil.  Having depleted the Indian population near S\u00e2o Paulo, they discovered the richly populated ''reducciones''. The Spanish authorities chose not to defend the settlements, and the Jesuits and their thousands of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s thus had little means to protect themselves. The ''mameluco'' threat ended only after 1639, after the capture of thousands of Indian neophytes, when the [[viceroy]] in Peru agreed to allow Indians to bear arms. Well-trained and highly motivated Indian units bloodied the raiders and drove them off. This victory set the stage for the [[golden age]] of the Jesuits in Paraguay. Life in the ''reducciones'' offered the Guaran\u00ed higher living standards, protection from settlers, and physical security. The ''reducciones'', which became quite wealthy, exported goods and supplied Indian armies.<ref name=tsw/>\n\nThe ''reducciones'', where the Jesuits sponsored orchestras, [[musical ensemble]]s and actors' troupes, and in which virtually all the profits derived from Indian labor were distributed to the laborers, earned praise from some of the leading lights of the [[France|French]] enlightenment, who were not predisposed to favor Jesuits. \"By means of religion,\" [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] wrote, \"the Jesuits established a monarchical authority in Paraguay, founded solely on their powers of persuasion and on their\nlenient methods of government. Masters of the country, they rendered happy the people under their sway; they succeeded in subduing them without ever having recourse to force.\" And [[Voltaire]] called the\nJesuit government \"a triumph of humanity.\" <ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Durant\n  | first = Will\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =  The Age of Reason Begins\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher = Simon & Schuster\n  | year = 1961\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LO_betbQgNoC&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=%22Paraguay+founded+solely+on+their+powers%22&source=bl&ots=eGAsNtY8HQ&sig=hwkF8y5-F67grIln0cnijdaNq6U&hl=en&ei=tDXvSa-dIsfMlQeh2twn&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1\n  | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }} the preceding paragraph is based on pages 249\u201350</ref>\n\nBecause of their success, the Paraguayan Jesuits gained many enemies, and the ''reducciones'' fell prey to changing times. During the 1720s and 1730s, Paraguayan settlers rebelled against Jesuit privileges in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (Paraguay)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] and the government that protected them. Although this revolt failed, it was one of the earliest and most serious risings against Spanish authority in the New World and caused the crown to question its continued support for the Jesuits. The Jesuit-inspired [[War of the Seven Reductions]] (1750\u201361), increased sentiment in [[Madrid]] for suppressing this \"empire within an empire.\" In a move to gain control of the ''reducciones'' wealth, the Spanish king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (1759\u201388), expelled the Jesuits in 1767. Within a few decades of the expulsion, most of what the Jesuits had accomplished was lost. The missions lost their valuables, became mismanaged, and were abandoned by the Guaran\u00ed. The Jesuits vanished almost without a trace. Today, a few weed-choked ruins are all that remain of this 160-year period in Paraguayan history.<ref name=tsw/>\n\nThe Jesuits and other Catholic orders did not duplicate their success with the Guarani among the nomadic and semi-nomadic people of western Paraguay, who resisted Spanish settlement and Christianity until the late 18th and 19th century.\n\n==Independence==\nThe [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia of Charcas]] had nominal authority over Paraguay, while Madrid largely neglected the colony. Madrid preferred to avoid the intricacies and the expense of governing and defending a remote colony that had shown early promise but ultimately proved to have dubious value. The governors of Paraguay had no royal troops at their disposal and were instead dependent on a [[militia]] composed of colonists. Paraguayans took advantage of this situation and claimed that the 1537 ''c\u00e9dula'' gave them the right to choose and depose their governors. The colony, and in particular the Asunci\u00f3n municipal council (''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]''), earned the reputation of being in continual revolt against the crown.\n\nTensions between royal authorities and settlers came to a head in 1720 over the status of the Jesuits, whose efforts to organize the Indians had denied the settlers easy access to Indian labor. A full-scale rebellion, known as the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (Paraguay)|Comunero Revolt]], broke out when the viceroy in Lima reinstated a pro-Jesuit governor whom the settlers had deposed. The revolt was in many ways a rehearsal for the radical events that began with independence in 1811. The most prosperous families of Asunci\u00f3n (whose [[yerba mat\u00e9]] and [[tobacco]] plantations competed directly with the Jesuits) initially led this revolt. But as the movement attracted support from poor farmers in the interior, the rich abandoned it and soon asked the royal authorities to restore order. In response, [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]] began to seize the estates of the upper class and drive them out of the countryside. A radical army nearly captured Asunci\u00f3n and was repulsed, ironically, only with the help of Indian troops from the Jesuit reducciones.\n\nThe revolt was symptomatic of decline. Since the refounding of Buenos Aires in 1580, the steady deterioration in the importance of Asunci\u00f3n contributed to growing political instability within the province. In 1617 the [[Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata|R\u00edo de la Plata Province]] was divided into two smaller provinces: Paraguay, with Asunci\u00f3n as its capital, and R\u00edo de la Plata, with headquarters in Buenos Aires. With this action, Asunci\u00f3n lost control of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary and became dependent on Buenos Aires for maritime shipping. In 1776 the crown created the [[Viceroyalty of R\u00edo de la Plata]]; Paraguay, which had been subordinate to Lima, now became an outpost of Buenos Aires. Located at the periphery of the empire, Paraguay served as a buffer state. The Portuguese blocked Paraguayan territorial expansion in the north, Indians blocked it - until their expulsion - in the south, and the Jesuits blocked it in the east. Paraguayans were forced into the colonial militia to serve extended tours of duty away from their homes, contributing to a severe labor shortage.\n\nBecause Paraguay was located far from colonial centers, it had little control over important decisions that affected its economy. Spain appropriated much of Paraguay's wealth through burdensome [[tax]]es and regulations. [[Yerba mat\u00e9]], for instance, was priced practically out of the regional market. At the same time, Spain was using most of its wealth from the [[New World]] to import manufactured goods from the more industrialized countries of Europe, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Spanish [[merchant]]s borrowed from British merchants to finance their purchases; merchants in Buenos Aires borrowed from Spain; those in Asunci\u00f3n borrowed from the porte\u00f1os (as residents of Buenos Aires were called); and Paraguayan peones (landless [[peasant]]s in debt to landlords) bought goods on [[credit (finance)|credit]]. The result was dire [[poverty]] in Paraguay and an increasingly impoverished empire.\n\nThe [[French Revolution]], the rise of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], and the subsequent war in Europe inevitably weakened Spain's ability to maintain contact with and defend and control its colonies. When British troops attempted to seize Buenos Aires in 1806, the attack was repulsed by the city's residents, not by Spain. Napoleon's [[Peninsular War|invasion of Spain]] in 1808, the capture of the Spanish king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], and Napoleon's attempt to put his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], on the Spanish throne, severed the major remaining links between [[metropolis]] and [[satellite state|satellite]]. Joseph had no constituency in Spanish America. Without a king, the entire colonial system lost its legitimacy, and the colonists revolted. Buoyed by their recent victory over British troops, the Buenos Aires ''cabildo'' deposed the Spanish viceroy on May 25, 1810, vowing to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII.\n\nThe ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' action had unforeseen consequences for the histories of Argentina and Paraguay. News of the events in Buenos Aires at first stunned the citizens of Asunci\u00f3n, who had largely supported the royalist position. Discontent with the Spanish [[monarchy]] was dismissed because of a bigger rivalry with the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe ''porte\u00f1os'' bungled their effort to extend control over Paraguay by choosing Jos\u00e9 Esp\u00ednola y Pe\u00f1a as their spokesman in Asunci\u00f3n. Esp\u00ednola was \"perhaps the most hated Paraguayan of his era,\" in the words of historian John Hoyt Williams. Esp\u00ednola's reception in Asunci\u00f3n was less than cordial, partly because he was closely linked to rapacious policies of the ex-governor, L\u00e1zaro de Rivera, who had arbitrarily shot hundreds of his citizens until he was forced from office in 1805. Barely escaping a term of [[exile]] in Paraguay's far north, Esp\u00ednola fled back to Buenos Aires and lied about the extent of ''porte\u00f1o'' support in Paraguay, causing the Buenos Aires ''cabildo'' to make an equally disastrous move. In a bid to settle the issue by force, the ''cabildo'' sent 1,100 troops under General [[Manuel Belgrano]] to subdue Asunci\u00f3n. Paraguayan troops soundly thrashed the ''porte\u00f1os'' at [[Battle of Paraguar\u00ed|Paraguar\u00ed]] and [[Battle of Tacuar\u00ed|Tacuar\u00ed]]. Officers from both armies, however, fraternized openly during the campaign. From these contacts the Paraguayans came to realize that Spanish dominance in South America was coming to an end, and that they, and not the Spaniards, held the real power.\n\nIf the Esp\u00ednola and Belgrano affairs served to whet [[nationalism|nationalist]] passions in Paraguay, the Paraguayan royalists' ill-conceived actions that followed inflamed them. Believing that the Paraguayan officers who had beaten the ''porte\u00f1os'' posed a direct threat to his rule, Governor Bernardo de Velasco dispersed and disarmed the forces under his command and sent most of the soldiers home without paying them for their eight months of service. Velasco previously had lost face when he fled the battlefield at Paraguar\u00ed, thinking Belgrano would win. Discontent spread, and the last straw was the request by the Asunci\u00f3n ''cabildo'' for Portuguese military support against Belgrano's forces, who were encamped just over the border in present-day Argentina. Far from bolstering the ''cabildo'''s position, this move instantly ignited an uprising and the overthrow of Spanish authority in Paraguay on May 14 and 15, 1811.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hanratty, Dannin M. & Sandra W.

Introduced in 1974, it was a step forward from the ''Hustler Newsletter'', originally conceived as cheap [[advertising]] for his [[strip club]] businesses at the time. The magazine grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million in the early 1980s; it has since dropped to approximately 500,000. It shows explicit views of the female genitalia, becoming one of the first major US-based magazines to do so, in contrast with relatively modest publications like ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref>Kipnis (2001) pp.134-135</ref>\n\nToday, ''Hustler'' is still considered more explicit (and more self-consciously [[Low culture|lowbrow]]) than such well-known competitors as ''Playboy'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. It frequently depicts [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] themes, such as the use of [[sex toy]]s, [[sexual intercourse|penetration]], [[oral sex]] and [[group sex]].\n\n[[Larry Flynt Publications]] also licenses the Hustler brand to the [[Hustler Casino]] in [[Gardena, California]] which is owned directly by Flynt as an individual through his holding company El Dorado Enterprises. Other enterprises include licensing the Hustler name to the [[Hustler Club]] chain of bars and clubs and the Hustler Hollywood store chain that sells adult-oriented videos, clothing, magazines and sex toys. The chain's flagship store is on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].  Both licensed enterprises are operated by LFP's partner, [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (company)|Deja Vu]].\n\n==Founding==\nThe business first began in [[Cincinnati]]. Here, Larry Flynt and his brother, [[Jimmy Flynt]], opened up a store in 1969. Jimmy wrote the check for $5,000 to pay for the club in Cincinnati, and he was listed on the masthead for volume 1, number 1 of the magazine in July, 1974. However, Larry fired his brother in 2009, and since then he has been developing his own business, Jimmy Flynt's Sexy Gifts Stand. An old member of ''Hustler'' magazine has described the relationship, saying, \"Larry is the show, and Jimmy makes it go\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ghose|first1=David|last2=Zucca|first2=Mario|title=Flynt Family Values|journal=Cincinnati Magazine|date=February 2013|volume=46|issue=5|page=66|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=e29c279d-b943-4aa6-a396-5826cd2445b2%40sessionmgr4009&vid=3&hid=4203&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=85288418&db=f5h|accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Publisher==\n[[File:Hustler Hollywood retail store.jpg|thumb|Hustler retail store in [[West Hollywood, California]]]]\n''Hustler'' is officially published by LFP, Inc, which also produces pornographic films. The abbreviation \"L.F.P.\" originally stood for \"Larry Flynt Publications.\"\n\nA [[Canadians|Canadian]] version of ''Hustler'' is published by a [[Quebec]]-based firm. This magazine is not owned by Larry Flynt, but is licensed to publish material from the American version. In general, Canadian ''Hustler'' imitates the appearance and tone of its American counterpart, with Canadian content added. In 1999, the magazine created a minor controversy in Canada by inviting readers to submit sexually explicit stories about [[Sheila Copps]], a left-leaning member of the Liberal cabinet. There have also been Australian, British and South African versions of the magazine.\n\nDuring a bookstore signing in July 2011, Flynt stated that less than five percent of his income comes from the print magazine; he also speculated that the print magazine will not be around in 2 to 3 years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2011/07/last_night_larry_flynt_talks_s.php |title=Last Night: Larry Flynt Talks Sex, Lies And Rick Perry At Brazos Books|first= Craig|last= Hlavaty|work=blogs.houstonpress.com |date=2011-07-28 |url-status=live |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Regular features==\nOne feature of ''Hustler'' is a column called \"Asshole of the Month\". In every monthly issue of the magazine, a public figure is selected for severe criticism as that month's \"asshole\". An illustration depicting the criticized person's head emerging from the anus of a cartoon donkey is shown alongside the article. After Flynt's imprisonment in 1977 and his alleged conversion to [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]], he promised to reform \"Asshole of the Month\". However, as of 2016, reform in the feature has yet to be seen.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Battling Pornography: The American Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement, 1976\u20131986|last=Bronstein|first=Carolyn|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, ''Hustler'' ran a comic strip feature entitled \"Honey Hooker\". In each installment, Honey would have graphic sexual encounters with any male (or female) she ran across. She might be in American colonial times one month or in a Super Bowl locker room the next. This feature was designed to compete against ''[[Playboy]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Little Annie Fanny]] and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Wicked Wanda]]. In keeping with ''Hustler'''s focus on the seamier and less romantic aspects of sexuality, Honey Hooker, unlike Fanny and Wanda, was explicitly portrayed as being a prostitute.\n\nThe ''Beaver Hunt'' section of the magazine contains explicit nudes of amateur models submitted by readers.<ref>Kipnis (2001) p. 149</ref>\n\nAnother ''Hustler'' feature that was heavily criticized was the \"[[Chester the Molester]]\" cartoon. Each month's issue depicted Chester, a cartoon middle-aged [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], joyfully [[Rape|raping]] or molesting young girls. After increasing citicism, the cartoon became \"Chester and Hester\", featuring Hester, an unattractive middle-aged woman who was either Chester's wife or girlfriend.  Following Flynt's alleged religious conversion, he introduced \"Chester the Protector\", a reincarnation of the molester character who served as a hero to protect young girls from rape and [[seduction]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA regular feature entitled \"Ads We'd Like to See\" recreates advertisements of everyday products in a sexualized or violent way. For example, an advertisement in the 1980 issue called 'Doer's Lite Label', a parody of [[Dewar's]] Lite Label Whiskey, featured [[Kenneth Bianchi]], the Hillside Strangler. Listed as his greatest accomplishment was [[Cindy Lee Hudspeth]], whom he actually strangled in 1978. He is quoted as saying \"You gotta treat 'em rough\u2026\". This section was highly criticized for admiring men who had committed sexualized crimes against women.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sex Crime|last=Caputi|first=Jane|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its regular features, ''Hustler'' occasionally published special features and issues. Examples include the \"All Meat\" issue from 1978, where the cover spread depicted a naked woman being fed into a meat grinder upside down. In 1977, the magazine's front page read \"First-Time Ever Scratch 'N' Sniff Centerfold\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Controversy and criticism ==\nIn 1984, conservative academic [[Judith Reisman]] received a grant from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to complete a study at [[American University]] concerning the cartoons of ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', and ''Hustler'', specifically the sexual depictions of minors in these cartoons. She finished the study in 1986, and found that on average, the number of times per issue that ''Hustler'' referred to children, crime, and violence was 46.<ref>Reisman, Judith A. \"Child Pornographer, Larry Flynt et. al: A Clear and Present Danger to Children.\" Former Principal Investigator of ''Images of Children, Crime & Violence in Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler'', 1989, US Dpt of Justice, Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Grant No. 84-JN-AX-K007.\n</ref>\n\nReisman published a nearly 1,600-page report of her findings, condemning the sexual depictions of children in pornographic magazines, but her work was met with criticism from her peers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Nude Women, Mud Pies, And The Deficit.|last=Kilpatrick|first=James|date=September 26, 1986|work=Toledo Blade|access-date=|via=Google News Archive|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VRNPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2wIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3253,4342177}}</ref> An American University professor, Dr. Myra Sadker, said that she was \"very dismayed about the quality of office management and the nature of the research that was going on.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=New study will determine how adult magazines affect children|last=Margasak|first=Larry|date=May 3, 1985|work=Gettysburg Times|access-date=|via=}}</ref> Many fellow academics have disputed the neutrality of the research.

He even published a short-lived political magazine called ''Rebel''. During the controversy surrounding [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], Flynt publicly announced his sympathy for Clinton, and offered cash rewards to anyone with information regarding sexual impropriety on the part of the president's critics.

Introduced in 1974, it was a step forward from the ''Hustler Newsletter'', originally conceived as cheap [[advertising]] for his [[strip club]] businesses at the time. The magazine grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million in the early 1980s; it has since dropped to approximately 500,000. It shows explicit views of the female genitalia, becoming one of the first major US-based magazines to do so, in contrast with relatively modest publications like ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref>Kipnis (2001) pp.134-135</ref>\n\nToday, ''Hustler'' is still considered more explicit (and more self-consciously [[Low culture|lowbrow]]) than such well-known competitors as ''Playboy'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. It frequently depicts [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] themes, such as the use of [[sex toy]]s, [[sexual intercourse|penetration]], [[oral sex]] and [[group sex]].\n\n[[Larry Flynt Publications]] also licenses the Hustler brand to the [[Hustler Casino]] in [[Gardena, California]] which is owned directly by Flynt as an individual through his holding company El Dorado Enterprises. Other enterprises include the [[Hustler Club]] chain of bars and clubs, and the Hustler store chain that sells adult-oriented videos, clothing, magazines and sex toys. The chain's flagship store is on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].\n\n==Founding==\nThe business first began in [[Cincinnati]]. Here, Larry Flynt and his brother, [[Jimmy Flynt]], opened up a store in 1969. Jimmy wrote the check for $5,000 to pay for the club in Cincinnati, and he was listed on the masthead for volume 1, number 1 of the magazine in July, 1974. However, Larry fired his brother in 2009, and since then he has been developing his own business, Jimmy Flynt's Sexy Gifts Stand. An old member of ''Hustler'' magazine has described the relationship, saying, \"Larry is the show, and Jimmy makes it go\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ghose|first1=David|last2=Zucca|first2=Mario|title=Flynt Family Values|journal=Cincinnati Magazine|date=February 2013|volume=46|issue=5|page=66|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=e29c279d-b943-4aa6-a396-5826cd2445b2%40sessionmgr4009&vid=3&hid=4203&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=85288418&db=f5h|accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Publisher==\n[[File:Hustler Hollywood retail store.jpg|thumb|Hustler retail store in [[West Hollywood, California]]]]\n''Hustler'' is officially published by LFP, Inc, which also produces pornographic films. The abbreviation \"L.F.P.\" originally stood for \"Larry Flynt Publications.\"\n\nA [[Canadians|Canadian]] version of ''Hustler'' is published by a [[Quebec]]-based firm. This magazine is not owned by Larry Flynt, but is licensed to publish material from the American version. In general, Canadian ''Hustler'' imitates the appearance and tone of its American counterpart, with Canadian content added. In 1999, the magazine created a minor controversy in Canada by inviting readers to submit sexually explicit stories about [[Sheila Copps]], a left-leaning member of the Liberal cabinet. There have also been Australian, British and South African versions of the magazine.\n\nDuring a bookstore signing in July 2011, Flynt stated that less than five percent of his income comes from the print magazine; he also speculated that the print magazine will not be around in 2 to 3 years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2011/07/last_night_larry_flynt_talks_s.php |title=Last Night: Larry Flynt Talks Sex, Lies And Rick Perry At Brazos Books|first= Craig|last= Hlavaty|work=blogs.houstonpress.com |date=2011-07-28 |url-status=live |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Regular features==\nOne feature of ''Hustler'' is a column called \"Asshole of the Month\". In every monthly issue of the magazine, a public figure is selected for severe criticism as that month's \"asshole\". An illustration depicting the criticized person's head emerging from the anus of a cartoon donkey is shown alongside the article. After Flynt's imprisonment in 1977 and his alleged conversion to [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]], he promised to reform \"Asshole of the Month\". However, as of 2016, reform in the feature has yet to be seen.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Battling Pornography: The American Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement, 1976\u20131986|last=Bronstein|first=Carolyn|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, ''Hustler'' ran a comic strip feature entitled \"Honey Hooker\". In each installment, Honey would have graphic sexual encounters with any male (or female) she ran across. She might be in American colonial times one month or in a Super Bowl locker room the next. This feature was designed to compete against ''[[Playboy]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Little Annie Fanny]] and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Wicked Wanda]]. In keeping with ''Hustler'''s focus on the seamier and less romantic aspects of sexuality, Honey Hooker, unlike Fanny and Wanda, was explicitly portrayed as being a prostitute.\n\nThe ''Beaver Hunt'' section of the magazine contains explicit nudes of amateur models submitted by readers.<ref>Kipnis (2001) p. 149</ref>\n\nAnother ''Hustler'' feature that was heavily criticized was the \"[[Chester the Molester]]\" cartoon. Each month's issue depicted Chester, a cartoon middle-aged [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], joyfully [[Rape|raping]] or molesting young girls. After increasing citicism, the cartoon became \"Chester and Hester\", featuring Hester, an unattractive middle-aged woman who was either Chester's wife or girlfriend.  Following Flynt's alleged religious conversion, he introduced \"Chester the Protector\", a reincarnation of the molester character who served as a hero to protect young girls from rape and [[seduction]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA regular feature entitled \"Ads We'd Like to See\" recreates advertisements of everyday products in a sexualized or violent way. For example, an advertisement in the 1980 issue called 'Doer's Lite Label', a parody of [[Dewar's]] Lite Label Whiskey, featured [[Kenneth Bianchi]], the Hillside Strangler. Listed as his greatest accomplishment was [[Cindy Lee Hudspeth]], whom he actually strangled in 1978. He is quoted as saying \"You gotta treat 'em rough\u2026\". This section was highly criticized for admiring men who had committed sexualized crimes against women.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sex Crime|last=Caputi|first=Jane|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its regular features, ''Hustler'' occasionally published special features and issues. Examples include the \"All Meat\" issue from 1978, where the cover spread depicted a naked woman being fed into a meat grinder upside down. In 1977, the magazine's front page read \"First-Time Ever Scratch 'N' Sniff Centerfold\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Controversy and criticism ==\nIn 1984, conservative academic [[Judith Reisman]] received a grant from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to complete a study at [[American University]] concerning the cartoons of ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', and ''Hustler'', specifically the sexual depictions of minors in these cartoons. She finished the study in 1986, and found that on average, the number of times per issue that ''Hustler'' referred to children, crime, and violence was 46.<ref>Reisman, Judith A. \"Child Pornographer, Larry Flynt et. al: A Clear and Present Danger to Children.\" Former Principal Investigator of ''Images of Children, Crime & Violence in Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler'', 1989, US Dpt of Justice, Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Grant No. 84-JN-AX-K007.\n</ref>\n\nReisman published a nearly 1,600-page report of her findings, condemning the sexual depictions of children in pornographic magazines, but her work was met with criticism from her peers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Nude Women, Mud Pies, And The Deficit.|last=Kilpatrick|first=James|date=September 26, 1986|work=Toledo Blade|access-date=|via=Google News Archive|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VRNPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2wIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3253,4342177}}</ref> An American University professor, Dr. Myra Sadker, said that she was \"very dismayed about the quality of office management and the nature of the research that was going on.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=New study will determine how adult magazines affect children|last=Margasak|first=Larry|date=May 3, 1985|work=Gettysburg Times|access-date=|via=}}</ref> Many fellow academics have disputed the neutrality of the research.

[[East Timor]] was also offered independence, shortly before it was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded by Indonesia]].\n\n=={{anchor|Context}}History==\n{{History of Portugal}}\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, nearly a half-century of authoritarian rule weighed on Portugal. After the [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], Portugal implemented an authoritarian regime incorporating [[social Catholicism]] and [[integralism]]. In 1933, the regime was recast and renamed Estado Novo (New State). [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] was prime minister until 1968, when he had a [[stroke]]. Salazar was replaced in September 1968 by [[Marcello Caetano]], who was deposed during the revolution.\n\nPortugal's Estado Novo government was initially tolerated by its [[NATO]] partners due to its [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. [[Sham election|Elections]] were rarely contested; the opposition used the limited [[political freedom]]s allowed during the brief election period to [[protest]] against the regime, withdrawing their candidates before the election to deny the regime [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]]. In 1958, General [[Humberto Delgado]] (a former member of the regime) stood against the regime's presidential candidate, [[Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s]], and refused to allow his name to be withdrawn.\n\nTom\u00e1s won the election amidst claims of widespread electoral fraud. Immediately after the election, the Salazar government abandoned the practice of popularly electing the president and gave the task to the [[National Assembly of Portugal|National Assembly]], which was firmly under the regime's control. During Caetano's time in office, he made minor attempts at political reform that did not go nearly far enough for a generation that had no memory of the instability that preceded the 1926 coup. However, even these meager reforms were obstructed by Salazarist elements in the regime. The hardliners were supported by Tom\u00e1s, who was unwilling to give Caetano as free a hand as Salazar had. The Estado Novo's political police, the [[PIDE]] (Pol\u00edcia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado, later the DGS, Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Seguran\u00e7a and originally the PVDE, Pol\u00edcia de Vigil\u00e2ncia e Defesa do Estado), [[Persecution|persecuted]] opponents of the regime, who were often tortured, imprisoned or killed.\n\nThe [[international community]] disliked the Portuguese regime. The [[Cold War]] was near its peak; [[Western Bloc|Western-]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern-bloc]] states were supporting [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in the [[Portuguese colonies]], attempting to bring them under American or Soviet influence. The overseas policy of the Portuguese government, despite the desire of many colonial residents to remain under Portuguese rule, led to an abrupt [[decolonisation]] after the Carnation Revolution and the fall of the regime in April 1974. For the Portuguese rulers, the overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]].\n\n===Colonial war===\n{{Main|Portuguese Colonial War}}\n\n[[File:AssaltonaMatadaSanga.jpg|thumb|alt=Armed soldier in a helicopter|[[Portuguese Air Force|PoAF]] helicopter in Africa]]\nIndependence movements began in the African colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Congo]], [[Portuguese Angola]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]].

The regime maintained a policy of [[corporatism]] which resulted in the placement of much of the economy in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates, including those founded by the families of [[Ant\u00f3nio Champalimaud]] ([[Banco Totta & A\u00e7ores]], [[Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor]], [[Secil]], [[Cimpor]]), [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Mello]] ([[Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril]]), [[Am\u00e9rico Amorim]] ([[Corticeira Amorim]]) and the dos Santos family ([[Jer\u00f3nimo Martins]]).\n\nThe Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most-diversified Portuguese conglomerates; its [[core business]]es included cement, [[petrochemical]]s, [[agrochemical]]s, textiles, beer, beverages, [[metallurgy]], [[naval engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[insurance]], banking, paper, tourism and mining. Although its corporate headquarters was in [[Continental Portugal|mainland Portugal]], it had branches, plants and projects throughout the Portuguese Empire (especially in the territories of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], Angola and Mozambique).\n\nOther medium-sized family companies specialised in textiles (such as those in [[Covilh\u00e3]] and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (such as those in [[Alcoba\u00e7a, Portugal|Alcoba\u00e7a]], [[Caldas da Rainha]] and [[Marinha Grande]]), engineered wood (such as [[SONAE]], near [[Porto]]), canned fish ([[Algarve]] and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (liqueurs, beer and [[port wine]]), tourism (in [[Estoril]], [[Cascais]], [[Sintra]] and the [[Algarve]]) and agriculture (the [[Alentejo]], known as the [[breadbasket]] of Portugal) by the early 1970s. Rural families engaged in agriculture and forestry.\n\nDuring the 1961\u20131974 Portuguese Colonial War (a [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] against [[guerrilla]]s), [[Portuguese Congo]], [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] (colonies at the time) experienced economic growth in the production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashews, coconuts, timber, minerals (including diamonds), metals (such as iron and aluminium), bananas, citrus, tea, sisal, beer, cement, fish and other seafood, beef and textiles.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Labor union|Labour unions]] were prohibited, and [[minimum wage]] laws were not enforced. The outbreak of colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano fostered economic growth and social improvement, such as a monthly [[pension]] to rural workers who had never contributed to Portugal's [[social security]]. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were to increase equity and [[economic efficiency]] and reduce [[fiscal imbalance]].\n\nAfter Salazar's stroke in 1968, Caetano took over as [[Prime Minister of Portugal|prime minister]]. He adopted a slogan of \"continuous evolution\", suggesting reforms of Salazar's system. Caetano's Primavera Marcelista (Marcelist Spring) included greater political tolerance and [[freedom of the press]], and was seen as an opportunity for the opposition to gain [[Concession (politics)|concessions]] from the regime. Portugal had a taste of democracy in 1969, and Caetano authorised the country's first democratic labour-union movement since the 1920s. However, after the elections of 1969 and 1973 it became clear that past [[political repression]] would continue against [[Communism|communists]], [[Anti-colonialism|anti-colonialists]] and other opponents of the regime.\n\n[[File:Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho Campaign Poster 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Campaign poster of a smiling Otelo Saraiva de Carvalh|1976 campaign poster for [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]], a leader of the revolution]]\nBy the early 1970s, the Portuguese Colonial War had a steadily-increasing budget. The [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portuguese military]] was overstretched and there was no political solution in sight. Although the number of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] was relatively small, the war had entered its second decade; Portugal faced criticism from the international community, and was becoming increasingly isolated.\n\nThe war had a profound impact on the country. Thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by [[Illegal emigration|emigrating illegally]], primarily to France and the United States.

The new government in [[Lisbon]] was no longer inclined to support Portugal's chaotic, expensive empire, and the Portuguese territories in Africa were rapidly granted independence.\n\n=={{anchor|Events}}Revolution==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Carnation Revolution}}\n\nIn February 1974, Caetano decided to remove General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]] from the [[President of Portugal|presidency]] in the face of Sp\u00ednola's increasing disagreement with the promotion of military officers and the direction of Portuguese colonial policy. This occurred shortly after the publication of Sp\u00ednola's book, ''Portugal and the Future'', which expressed his political and military views of the Portuguese Colonial War. Several military officers who opposed the war formed the MFA to overthrow the government in a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. The MFA was headed by [[V\u00edtor Alves (soldier)|V\u00edtor Alves]], [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]] and Vasco Louren\u00e7o, and was joined later by [[Salgueiro Maia]]. The movement was aided by other Portuguese army officers who supported Sp\u00ednola and democratic civil and military reform. It is speculated that [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] actually led the revolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe coup had two secret signals. The first was the airing at 10:55&nbsp;p.m. on 24 April of [[Paulo de Carvalho]]'s \"[[E Depois do Adeus]]\" (Portugal's entry in the [[1974 Eurovision Song Contest]]) on Emissores Associados de Lisboa, which alerted the rebel captains and soldiers to begin the coup. The second signal came at 12:20&nbsp;a.m. on 25 April, when [[R\u00e1dio Renascen\u00e7a]] broadcast \"[[Gr\u00e2ndola, Vila Morena]]\" (a song by [[Zeca Afonso]], an influential political [[folk music]]ian and singer who was banned from Portuguese radio at the time). The MFA gave the signals to take over strategic points of power in the country.\n\nSix hours later, the Caetano government relented. Despite repeated radio appeals from the \"captains of April\" (the MFA) advising the population to stay home, thousands of Portuguese took to the streets&nbsp;\u2013 mingling with, and supporting, the military insurgents.

Although no [[mass demonstration]]s preceded the coup, spontaneous civilian involvement turned the military coup into a popular revolution \"led by radical army officers, soldiers, workers and peasants that toppled the senile Salazar dictatorship, using the language of socialism and democracy.

This building was surrounded by the MFA, which pressured him to cede power to General Sp\u00ednola. Caetano and President [[Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s]] fled to Brazil; Caetano spent the rest of his life there, and Tom\u00e1s returned to Portugal a few years later. The revolution was closely watched by neighbouring Spain, where the government (and the opposition) were planning the [[Head of state succession|succession]] of Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]].

Portugal experienced a turbulent period, known as the [[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]] (Ongoing Revolutionary Process).\n\nThe conservative forces surrounding Spinola and the MFA radicals initially confronted each other (covertly or overtly), and Spinola was forced to appoint key MFA figures to senior security positions. Right-wing military figures attempted an unsuccessful [[counter-coup]], resulting in Spinola's removal from office. Unrest within the MFA between leftist forces (often close to the [[Communist Party of Portugal|Communist Party]]) and more-moderate groups (often allied with the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialists]]) eventually led to the group's splintering and dissolution.\n\nThis stage of the PREC lasted until 25 November 1975 [[Coup of 25 November 1975|pro-communist coup, followed by a successful counter-coup by pro-democracy moderates]], and was marked by constant friction between liberal-democratic forces and leftist-communist political parties.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=eacalvao ENTREVISTA COM ALPOIM CALV\u00c3O], Centro de Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]</ref> Portugal's [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|first free election]] was held on 25 April 1975 to write a new constitution replacing the [[Constitution of Portugal#Constitution of 1933|Constitution of 1933]], which prevailed during the Estado Novo era.

In [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], independence movements were active in more remote rural areas from which the Portuguese Army had retreated.\n\nA consequence of the Carnation Revolution was the sudden withdrawal of Portuguese administrative and military personnel from its overseas colonies.

After the [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], Portugal implemented an authoritarian regime incorporating [[social Catholicism]] and [[integralism]]. In 1933, the regime was recast and renamed Estado Novo (New State). [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] was prime minister until 1968, when he had a [[stroke]]. Salazar was replaced in September 1968 by [[Marcello Caetano]], who was deposed during the revolution.\n\nPortugal's Estado Novo government was initially tolerated by its [[NATO]] partners due to its [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. [[Sham election|Elections]] were rarely contested; the opposition used the limited [[political freedom]]s allowed during the brief election period to [[protest]] against the regime, withdrawing their candidates before the election to deny the regime [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]]. In 1958, General [[Humberto Delgado]] (a former member of the regime) stood against the regime's presidential candidate, [[Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s]], and refused to allow his name to be withdrawn.\n\nTom\u00e1s won the election amidst claims of widespread electoral fraud. Immediately after the election, the Salazar government abandoned the practice of popularly electing the president and gave the task to the [[National Assembly of Portugal|National Assembly]], which was firmly under the regime's control. During Caetano's time in office, he made minor attempts at political reform that did not go nearly far enough for a generation that had no memory of the instability that preceded the 1926 coup. However, even these meager reforms were obstructed by Salazarist elements in the regime. The hardliners were supported by Tom\u00e1s, who was unwilling to give Caetano as free a hand as Salazar had.

The overseas policy of the Portuguese government, despite the desire of many colonial residents to remain under Portuguese rule, led to an abrupt [[decolonisation]] after the Carnation Revolution and the fall of the regime in April 1974.

The regime maintained a policy of [[corporatism]] which resulted in the placement of much of the economy in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates, including those founded by the families of [[Ant\u00f3nio Champalimaud]] ([[Banco Totta & A\u00e7ores]], [[Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor]], [[Secil]], [[Cimpor]]), [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Mello]] ([[Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril]]), [[Am\u00e9rico Amorim]] ([[Corticeira Amorim]]) and the dos Santos family ([[Jer\u00f3nimo Martins]]).\n\nThe Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most-diversified Portuguese conglomerates; its [[core business]]es included cement, [[petrochemical]]s, [[agrochemical]]s, textiles, beer, beverages, [[metallurgy]], [[naval engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[insurance]], banking, paper, tourism and mining. Although its corporate headquarters was in [[Continental Portugal|mainland Portugal]], it had branches, plants and projects throughout the Portuguese Empire (especially in the territories of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], Angola and Mozambique).\n\nOther medium-sized family companies specialised in textiles (such as those in [[Covilh\u00e3]] and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (such as those in [[Alcoba\u00e7a, Portugal|Alcoba\u00e7a]], [[Caldas da Rainha]] and [[Marinha Grande]]), engineered wood (such as [[SONAE]], near [[Porto]]), canned fish ([[Algarve]] and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (liqueurs, beer and [[port wine]]), tourism (in [[Estoril]], [[Cascais]], [[Sintra]] and the [[Algarve]]) and agriculture (the [[Alentejo]], known as the [[breadbasket]] of Portugal) by the early 1970s. Rural families engaged in agriculture and forestry.\n\nDuring the 1961\u20131974 Portuguese Colonial War (a [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] against [[guerrilla]]s), [[Portuguese Congo]], [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] (colonies at the time) experienced economic growth in the production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashews, coconuts, timber, minerals (including diamonds), metals (such as iron and aluminium), bananas, citrus, tea, sisal, beer, cement, fish and other seafood, beef and textiles.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Labor union|Labour unions]] were prohibited, and [[minimum wage]] laws were not enforced. The outbreak of colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano fostered economic growth and social improvement, such as a monthly [[pension]] to rural workers who had never contributed to Portugal's [[social security]]. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were to increase equity and [[economic efficiency]] and reduce [[fiscal imbalance]].\n\nAfter Salazar's stroke in 1968, Caetano took over as [[Prime Minister of Portugal|prime minister]]. He adopted a slogan of \"continuous evolution\", suggesting reforms of Salazar's system. Caetano's Primavera Marcelista (Marcelist Spring) included greater political tolerance and [[freedom of the press]], and was seen as an opportunity for the opposition to gain [[Concession (politics)|concessions]] from the regime. Portugal had a taste of democracy in 1969, and Caetano authorised the country's first democratic labour-union movement since the 1920s. However, after the elections of 1969 and 1973 it became clear that past [[political repression]] would continue against [[Communism|communists]], [[Anti-colonialism|anti-colonialists]] and other opponents of the regime.\n\n[[File:Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho Campaign Poster 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Campaign poster of a smiling Otelo Saraiva de Carvalh|1976 campaign poster for [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]], a leader of the revolution]]\nBy the early 1970s, the Portuguese Colonial War had a steadily-increasing budget. The [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portuguese military]] was overstretched and there was no political solution in sight. Although the number of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] was relatively small, the war had entered its second decade; Portugal faced criticism from the international community, and was becoming increasingly isolated.\n\nThe war had a profound impact on the country. Thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by [[Illegal emigration|emigrating illegally]], primarily to France and the United States. The revolutionary [[Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA) began as an attempt to liberate Portugal from the Estado Novo regime and challenge new military laws which were [[coming into force]].<ref name=\"infopedia.pt\">{{in lang|pt}} Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MFA).

The new government in [[Lisbon]] was no longer inclined to support Portugal's chaotic, expensive empire, and the Portuguese territories in Africa were rapidly granted independence.\n\n=={{anchor|Events}}Revolution==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Carnation Revolution}}\n\nIn February 1974, Caetano decided to remove General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]] from the [[President of Portugal|presidency]] in the face of Sp\u00ednola's increasing disagreement with the promotion of military officers and the direction of Portuguese colonial policy. This occurred shortly after the publication of Sp\u00ednola's book, ''Portugal and the Future'', which expressed his political and military views of the Portuguese Colonial War. Several military officers who opposed the war formed the MFA to overthrow the government in a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. The MFA was headed by [[V\u00edtor Alves (soldier)|V\u00edtor Alves]], [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]] and Vasco Louren\u00e7o, and was joined later by [[Salgueiro Maia]]. The movement was aided by other Portuguese army officers who supported Sp\u00ednola and democratic civil and military reform. It is speculated that [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] actually led the revolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe coup had two secret signals. The first was the airing at 10:55&nbsp;p.m. on 24 April of [[Paulo de Carvalho]]'s \"[[E Depois do Adeus]]\" (Portugal's entry in the [[1974 Eurovision Song Contest]]) on Emissores Associados de Lisboa, which alerted the rebel captains and soldiers to begin the coup. The second signal came at 12:20&nbsp;a.m. on 25 April, when [[R\u00e1dio Renascen\u00e7a]] broadcast \"[[Gr\u00e2ndola, Vila Morena]]\" (a song by [[Zeca Afonso]], an influential political [[folk music]]ian and singer who was banned from Portuguese radio at the time). The MFA gave the signals to take over strategic points of power in the country.\n\nSix hours later, the Caetano government relented. Despite repeated radio appeals from the \"captains of April\" (the MFA) advising the population to stay home, thousands of Portuguese took to the streets&nbsp;\u2013 mingling with, and supporting, the military insurgents. A central gathering point was the Lisbon flower market, then richly stocked with carnations (which were in season). Some of the insurgents put carnations in their [[gun barrel]]s, an image broadcast on television worldwide<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://adst.org/2015/04/the-carnation-revolution-a-peaceful-coup-in-portugal/|title=The Carnation Revolution \u2013 A Peaceful Coup in Portugal \u2013 Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training|date=13 April 2015|work=Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref> which gave the revolution its name. Although no [[mass demonstration]]s preceded the coup, spontaneous civilian involvement turned the military coup into a popular revolution \"led by radical army officers, soldiers, workers and peasants that toppled the senile Salazar dictatorship, using the language of socialism and democracy. The attempt to radicalise the outcome,\" noted a contemporary observer of the time, \"had little mass support and was easily suppressed by the [[Portuguese Socialist Party]] and its allies.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Tariq |last=Ali|title='Preface' in A Calculus of Power|publisher=Verso |year=2010|isbn=978-1-84467-620-0}}</ref>\n\nCaetano found refuge in the main Lisbon military police station at the Largo do Carmo. This building was surrounded by the MFA, which pressured him to cede power to General Sp\u00ednola. Caetano and President [[Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s]] fled to Brazil; Caetano spent the rest of his life there, and Tom\u00e1s returned to Portugal a few years later. The revolution was closely watched by neighbouring Spain, where the government (and the opposition) were planning the [[Head of state succession|succession]] of Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]]. Franco died a year and a half later, in 1975.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:25 Abril 1983 Porto by Henrique Matos 01.jpg|thumb|alt=Demonstration with red flags and a green mock tank|Demonstration in [[Porto]], 1983]]\nAfter the coup, power was held by the [[National Salvation Junta]] (a military junta). Portugal experienced a turbulent period, known as the [[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]] (Ongoing Revolutionary Process).\n\nThe conservative forces surrounding Spinola and the MFA radicals initially confronted each other (covertly or overtly), and Spinola was forced to appoint key MFA figures to senior security positions. Right-wing military figures attempted an unsuccessful [[counter-coup]], resulting in Spinola's removal from office. Unrest within the MFA between leftist forces (often close to the [[Communist Party of Portugal|Communist Party]]) and more-moderate groups (often allied with the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialists]]) eventually led to the group's splintering and dissolution.\n\nThis stage of the PREC lasted until 25 November 1975 [[Coup of 25 November 1975|pro-communist coup, followed by a successful counter-coup by pro-democracy moderates]], and was marked by constant friction between liberal-democratic forces and leftist-communist political parties.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=eacalvao ENTREVISTA COM ALPOIM CALV\u00c3O], Centro de Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]</ref> Portugal's [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|first free election]] was held on 25 April 1975 to write a new constitution replacing the [[Constitution of Portugal#Constitution of 1933|Constitution of 1933]], which prevailed during the Estado Novo era.

Although part of [[Guinea-Bissau]] became independent ''de facto'' in 1973, [[Bissau]] (its capital) and the large towns were still under Portuguese control. In [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], independence movements were active in more remote rural areas from which the Portuguese Army had retreated.\n\nA consequence of the Carnation Revolution was the sudden withdrawal of Portuguese administrative and military personnel from its overseas colonies. Hundreds of thousands of [[Portuguese Africans]] returned to Portugal. These people\u2014workers, small businesspeople, and farmers\u2014often had deep roots in the former colonies and became known as the ''retornados''.\n\nAngola began a [[Angolan Civil War|decades-long civil war]] which involved the [[Soviet Union]], [[Cuba]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]].

The innovation and success of the Remingtons spurred further development of the industry in the state.\n\n==Early paper mills==\nThere is documentation that the New York merchant John Keating opened a paper mill in [[Manhattan]] in 1768, although no [[watermark]]s have been attributed to that mill.<ref name=\"Bidwell-196\">Bidwell, John (2013).
