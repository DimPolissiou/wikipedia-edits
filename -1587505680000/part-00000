In 1832, the hitherto semi-legendary state was officially proclaimed the first kingdom of [[Burmese monarchy]] by ''[[Glass Palace Chronicle|Hmannan Yazawin]]'', the [[Burmese chronicles|Royal Chronicle]] of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]]. ''Hmannan'' adds that the \"kingdom\" was founded by [[Abhiyaza]] of the [[Shakya|Sakya clan]] of the [[Buddha]] in 850 [[Common era|BCE]], and that through Abiyaza, Burmese monarchs traced their lineage to the Buddha and the first Buddhist (mythical) king of the world [[Maha Sammata]].<ref name=hy-1-153-154/> ''Hmannan'' also introduces another Sakya prince [[Dazayaza]] who founded the second Tagaung dynasty c. 600 BCE.

They settled and founded a kingdom at Tagaung in present-day northern Burma at the upper banks of the [[Irrawaddy river]] in 850 BCE.<ref name=hy-1-153-154>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 153\u2013154</ref>\n\n===First Tagaung Dynasty===\n{{see also|Monarchs of the First Tagaung Dynasty}}\n\n''Hmannan'' does not claim that Abhiyaza had arrived in an empty land, only that he was the first king. He had two sons, and died after a 25-year reign at Tagaung. The elder son [[Kanyaza Gyi]] ({{my|\u1000\u1036\u101b\u102c\u1007\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038}}) lost the throne to his younger brother [[Kanyaza Nge]] ({{my|\u1000\u1036\u101b\u102c\u1007\u102c\u1004\u101a\u103a}}). Kanyaza Gyi ventured south, and founded his own kingdom at [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in 825 BCE. Kanyaza Nge succeeded his father, and was followed by a dynasty of 31 kings.<ref name=hy-1-155-156>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 155\u2013156</ref><ref name=tmu-2006-44-45>Myint-U 2006: 44\u201345</ref> Circa 600 BCE, ''Taruk'' marauders from [[Yunnan|Gandhara]] ({{my|\u1002\u1014\u1039\u1013\u102c\u101c\u101b\u102c\u1007\u103a}}) sacked the city.

One group moved down and settled at [[Bagan|Thunapayanta]] which was then inhabited by [[Pyu people|Pyus]], [[Kanyan people|Kanyans]] and [[Thet people|Thets]]. Another group went southeast, and founded what would later be known as the 19 districts of [[Kyaukse]]. They became known as the Binnaka line.<ref name=hy-1-155-156/> (Thunapayanta was located near present-day Pagan (Bagan), and the primary Pyu city-state in Kyaukse was [[Maingmaw]].<ref name=ehm-236>Moore 2007: 236</ref>) A third group led by Naga Hsein ({{my|\u1014\u102c\u1002\u1006\u102d\u1014\u103a}}), the queen of Binnaka Yaza, remained at Tagaung.\n\nThe queen then met [[Dazayaza]] (Dhajaraja), of royal Sakya lineage who had recently settled in Mauriya (somewhere in Upper Burma). She married him. Dazayaza and Naga Hsein built a new capital at Old Pagan, close to Tagaung. A dynasty of 16 kings followed.<ref name=hy-1-159-160>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 159\u2013160</ref> Some time after 483 BCE, invaders from the east sacked the kingdom during the reign of [[Thado Maha Yaza]], the 17th and last king.<ref name=app-276>Phayre 1883: 276</ref>\n\n===Tagaung legacy and linkage to later Burmese dynasties===\nBut the Sakya lineage had not died out, ''Hmannan'' continues. In 503 BCE, the queen of the last king of Tagaung, Thado Maha Yaza gave birth to twin blind sons, [[Maha Thanbawa]] and [[Sula Thanbawa]]. The king was ashamed, and ordered them killed. The queen hid her sons, and raised them in secret. Nineteen years later, in 484 BCE, the king found out that the brothers were still alive, and again ordered them killed. The queen managed to put the sons on a raft down the Irrawaddy.<ref name=hy-1-164-165>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 164\u2013165</ref> Adrift in the river, the brothers miraculously gained sight with the help of the ogress.\n\nIn 483 BCE, the brothers founded another kingdom much farther down the Irrawaddy at [[Sri Ksetra]], near modern [[Pyay]] (Prome). Maha Thanbawa was the first king and ruled for six years. He was followed by Sula Thanbawa, ruling for 35 years. He was followed by King Duttabaung, son of Maha Thanbawa. Duttabaung ruled for 70 years.<ref name=app-277-278>Phayre 1883: 277\u2013278</ref> In all, Sri Ksetra lasted nearly six centuries.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/>\n\nAround 107 CE, [[Thamoddarit]] ({{my|\u101e\u1019\u102f\u1012\u1039\u1012\u101b\u102c\u1007\u103a}}), nephew of the last king of Sri Ksetra, founded the city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) (formally, Arimaddana-pura ({{my|\u1021\u101b\u102d\u1019\u1012\u1039\u1012\u1014\u102c\u1015\u1030\u101b}}), lit. \"the City that Tramples on Enemies\").<ref name=vbl-91>Lieberman 2003: 91</ref> The site reportedly was visited by the Buddha himself during his lifetime, and it was where he allegedly pronounced that a great kingdom would arise at this very location 651 years after his death.<ref name=hy-1-188>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 188</ref> Thamoddarit was followed by a caretaker, and then Pyusawhti in 167 CE. The connection to the Pagan Dynasty was important because all later Burmese dynasties, [[Myinsaing Kingdom|Myinsaing]] to [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] claimed lineage to the monarchs of Pagan.\n\n===Historicity===\nThe Abhiyaza story first appeared in Hmannan Yazawin (the Glass Palace Chronicle), compiled in 1832. The Burmese chronicles down to the early 18th century, including ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' (the Great Chronicle) written in 1724, upon which ''Hmannan'' is heavily based, do not mention Abhiyaza. Instead, the pre-Hmannan origin story of the Burmese monarchy speaks of one Pyusawhti, son a solar spirit and a dragon princess, who later founded the [[Pagan Dynasty]].<ref name=tt-1964-ix-x>Than Tun 1964: ix\u2013x</ref> Moreover, the Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories were layered upon the oral histories/legends of Tagaung and Sri Ksetra.\n\nHistorians trace the rise of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories to the 1770s, part of the early Konbaung kings' efforts to promote a more orthodox version of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The trend gained ground under King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782\u20131819) who, like his father [[Alaungpaya]], believed that he was the next Buddha, [[Maitreya]]. Though the king would later reluctantly gave up his claim and acceded to his late father's claim,<ref name=mha-188-189>Htin Aung 1967: 188\u2013189</ref> his purification drive devalued \"local sources of sanctity\" in favour of \"universal textual forms endorsed by the crown and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|monkhood]]\", and \"outlawed animal sacrifices atop [[Mt. Popa]] and other sacred sites while female and transvestite shamans lost status.\" In the reign of his successor [[Bagyidaw]] in 1832, the pre-Buddhist origin story of Pyusawhti was officially superseded with the Abhiyaza story's \"claims of royal descent from the clan of Gotama Buddha and thence the first Buddhist king of the world, Maha Sammata\".<ref name=vbl-196>Lieberman 2003: 196</ref>\n\nThe Chinese history book ''[[History of Yuan|Yuanshi]]'' also recorded the name \"Tagaung\". But it just a small town in north Burma. Chinese invasion happened in 13 century that known as [[First Mongol invasion of Burma]]. ''Hmannan Yazawin'' move it up to 6 BCE and became the history of Tagaung.<ref>He 2004: 39 - 40</ref>\n\nThe late inclusion of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories did much damage to the credibility of the chronicles to the European historians of the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial era]]. They outright dismissed much of the chronicle tradition of early Burmese history as \"copies of Indian legends taken from Sanskrit or Pali originals\", highly doubted the antiquity of the chronicle tradition, and dismissed the possibility that any sort of civilisation in Burma could be much older than 500 CE.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/><ref name=dgeh-7>Hall 1960: 7</ref><ref name=-geh-307-309>Harvey 1925: 307\u2013309</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Pyu city-states}}\n[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|left|150px|Pyu city-states circa 8th century]]\n\nThe Abhiyaza myth notwithstanding, evidence does indicate that many of the places mentioned in the royal records have indeed been inhabited continuously for at least 3500 years.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/> [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts discovered at Kyan Hnyat (30&nbsp;km south of Tagaung) confirm human habitation at Tagaung in the same era (1st millennium BCE) of both Tagaung dynasties reported in pre-''Hmannan'' chronicles.<ref name=ehm-2011-4-5>Moore 2011: 4\u20135</ref> To be sure, evidence of human habitation is not the same as that of a city-state. Extant evidence indicates that Tagaung emerged as a city-state (a triple-walled emerged as a city-state site on the east bank of the Irrawaddy) only in the \"early centuries CE\". (However, Tagaung has not been extensively excavated, and earlier evidence may yet emerge. Aside from Sri Ksetra and Beikthano, the rest of the Pyu sites have not been extensively excavated.) Moreover, the states of Tagaung, Sri Ksetra and Pagan all existed in the order, though not in the discrete fashion reported in the chronicles.

The location of Vedic [[shakha]]s is labelled in green.]]\n\n===Out of India===\nTagaung came to be featured prominently in an effort by the early Konbaung kings to link the origins of Burmese monarchy to the Buddha, and ultimately the first king of the world in [[Buddhist mythology]], [[Maha Sammata]]. Hmannan states that Prince [[Abhiyaza]] (Abhiraja) ({{my|\u1021\u1018\u102d\u101b\u102c\u1007\u102c}}) of [[Kosala|Kingdom of Kosala]] ({{my|\u1000\u1031\u102c\u101e\u101c}}) of the [[Shakya|Sakya clan]] ({{my|\u101e\u1000\u103b \u101e\u102c\u1000\u102e\u101d\u1004\u103a \u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103b\u102d\u102f\u1038}})\u2014the clan of the Buddha and Maha Sammata\u2014and his followers left their homeland, following a military defeat against their neighbouring [[Panchala|Kingdom of Panchala]] ({{my|\u1015\u1009\u1039\u1005\u102c\u101c\u101b\u102c\u1007\u103a}}). They settled and founded a kingdom at Tagaung in present-day northern Burma at the upper banks of the [[Irrawaddy river]] in 850 BCE.<ref name=hy-1-153-154>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 153\u2013154</ref>\n\n===First Tagaung Dynasty===\n{{see also|Monarchs of the First Tagaung Dynasty}}\n\n''Hmannan'' does not claim that Abhiyaza had arrived in an empty land, only that he was the first king. He had two sons, and died after a 25-year reign at Tagaung. The elder son [[Kanyaza Gyi]] ({{my|\u1000\u1036\u101b\u102c\u1007\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038}}) lost the throne to his younger brother [[Kanyaza Nge]] ({{my|\u1000\u1036\u101b\u102c\u1007\u102c\u1004\u101a\u103a}}). Kanyaza Gyi ventured south, and founded his own kingdom at [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in 825 BCE. Kanyaza Nge succeeded his father, and was followed by a dynasty of 31 kings.<ref name=hy-1-155-156>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 155\u2013156</ref><ref name=tmu-2006-44-45>Myint-U 2006: 44\u201345</ref> Circa 600 BCE, ''Taruk'' marauders from [[Yunnan|Gandhara]] ({{my|\u1002\u1014\u1039\u1013\u102c\u101c\u101b\u102c\u1007\u103a}}) sacked the city. (The invaders were from Yunnan. ''Taruk'' refers to the [[Han Chinese]] in modern Burmese but in Old Burmese, it referred to anyone from the northeast.

One group moved down and settled at [[Bagan|Thunapayanta]] which was then inhabited by [[Pyu people|Pyus]], [[Kanyan people|Kanyans]] and [[Thet people|Thets]]. Another group went southeast, and founded what would later be known as the 19 districts of [[Kyaukse]]. They became known as the Binnaka line.<ref name=hy-1-155-156/> (Thunapayanta was located near present-day Pagan (Bagan), and the primary Pyu city-state in Kyaukse was [[Maingmaw]].<ref name=ehm-236>Moore 2007: 236</ref>) A third group led by Naga Hsein ({{my|\u1014\u102c\u1002\u1006\u102d\u1014\u103a}}), the queen of Binnaka Yaza, remained at Tagaung.\n\nThe queen then met [[Dazayaza]] (Dhajaraja), of royal Sakya lineage who had recently settled in Mauriya (somewhere in Upper Burma). She married him. Dazayaza and Naga Hsein built a new capital at Old Pagan, close to Tagaung. A dynasty of 16 kings followed.<ref name=hy-1-159-160>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 159\u2013160</ref> Some time after 483 BCE, invaders from the east sacked the kingdom during the reign of [[Thado Maha Yaza]], the 17th and last king.<ref name=app-276>Phayre 1883: 276</ref>\n\n===Tagaung legacy and linkage to later Burmese dynasties===\nBut the Sakya lineage had not died out, ''Hmannan'' continues. In 503 BCE, the queen of the last king of Tagaung, Thado Maha Yaza gave birth to twin blind sons, [[Maha Thanbawa]] and [[Sula Thanbawa]]. The king was ashamed, and ordered them killed. The queen hid her sons, and raised them in secret. Nineteen years later, in 484 BCE, the king found out that the brothers were still alive, and again ordered them killed. The queen managed to put the sons on a raft down the Irrawaddy.<ref name=hy-1-164-165>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 164\u2013165</ref> Adrift in the river, the brothers miraculously gained sight with the help of the ogress.\n\nIn 483 BCE, the brothers founded another kingdom much farther down the Irrawaddy at [[Sri Ksetra]], near modern [[Pyay]] (Prome). Maha Thanbawa was the first king and ruled for six years. He was followed by Sula Thanbawa, ruling for 35 years. He was followed by King Duttabaung, son of Maha Thanbawa. Duttabaung ruled for 70 years.<ref name=app-277-278>Phayre 1883: 277\u2013278</ref> In all, Sri Ksetra lasted nearly six centuries.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/>\n\nAround 107 CE, [[Thamoddarit]] ({{my|\u101e\u1019\u102f\u1012\u1039\u1012\u101b\u102c\u1007\u103a}}), nephew of the last king of Sri Ksetra, founded the city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) (formally, Arimaddana-pura ({{my|\u1021\u101b\u102d\u1019\u1012\u1039\u1012\u1014\u102c\u1015\u1030\u101b}}), lit. \"the City that Tramples on Enemies\").<ref name=vbl-91>Lieberman 2003: 91</ref> The site reportedly was visited by the Buddha himself during his lifetime, and it was where he allegedly pronounced that a great kingdom would arise at this very location 651 years after his death.<ref name=hy-1-188>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 188</ref> Thamoddarit was followed by a caretaker, and then Pyusawhti in 167 CE. The connection to the Pagan Dynasty was important because all later Burmese dynasties, [[Myinsaing Kingdom|Myinsaing]] to [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] claimed lineage to the monarchs of Pagan.\n\n===Historicity===\nThe Abhiyaza story first appeared in Hmannan Yazawin (the Glass Palace Chronicle), compiled in 1832. The Burmese chronicles down to the early 18th century, including ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' (the Great Chronicle) written in 1724, upon which ''Hmannan'' is heavily based, do not mention Abhiyaza. Instead, the pre-Hmannan origin story of the Burmese monarchy speaks of one Pyusawhti, son a solar spirit and a dragon princess, who later founded the [[Pagan Dynasty]].<ref name=tt-1964-ix-x>Than Tun 1964: ix\u2013x</ref> Moreover, the Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories were layered upon the oral histories/legends of Tagaung and Sri Ksetra.\n\nHistorians trace the rise of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories to the 1770s, part of the early Konbaung kings' efforts to promote a more orthodox version of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The trend gained ground under King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782\u20131819) who, like his father [[Alaungpaya]], believed that he was the next Buddha, [[Maitreya]]. Though the king would later reluctantly gave up his claim and acceded to his late father's claim,<ref name=mha-188-189>Htin Aung 1967: 188\u2013189</ref> his purification drive devalued \"local sources of sanctity\" in favour of \"universal textual forms endorsed by the crown and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|monkhood]]\", and \"outlawed animal sacrifices atop [[Mt. Popa]] and other sacred sites while female and transvestite shamans lost status.\" In the reign of his successor [[Bagyidaw]] in 1832, the pre-Buddhist origin story of Pyusawhti was officially superseded with the Abhiyaza story's \"claims of royal descent from the clan of Gotama Buddha and thence the first Buddhist king of the world, Maha Sammata\".<ref name=vbl-196>Lieberman 2003: 196</ref>\n\nThe late inclusion of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories did much damage to the credibility of the chronicles to the European historians of the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial era]]. They outright dismissed much of the chronicle tradition of early Burmese history as \"copies of Indian legends taken from Sanskrit or Pali originals\", highly doubted the antiquity of the chronicle tradition, and dismissed the possibility that any sort of civilisation in Burma could be much older than 500 CE.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/><ref name=dgeh-7>Hall 1960: 7</ref><ref name=-geh-307-309>Harvey 1925: 307\u2013309</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Pyu city-states}}\n[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|left|150px|Pyu city-states circa 8th century]]\n\nThe Abhiyaza myth notwithstanding, evidence does indicate that many of the places mentioned in the royal records have indeed been inhabited continuously for at least 3500 years.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/> [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts discovered at Kyan Hnyat (30&nbsp;km south of Tagaung) confirm human habitation at Tagaung in the same era (1st millennium BCE) of both Tagaung dynasties reported in pre-''Hmannan'' chronicles.<ref name=ehm-2011-4-5>Moore 2011: 4\u20135</ref> To be sure, evidence of human habitation is not the same as that of a city-state. Extant evidence indicates that Tagaung emerged as a city-state (a triple-walled emerged as a city-state site on the east bank of the Irrawaddy) only in the \"early centuries CE\". (However, Tagaung has not been extensively excavated, and earlier evidence may yet emerge. Aside from Sri Ksetra and Beikthano, the rest of the Pyu sites have not been extensively excavated.) Moreover, the states of Tagaung, Sri Ksetra and Pagan all existed in the order, though not in the discrete fashion reported in the chronicles.

By 1966, a staff of six administrative personnel and 18 instructors handled 11 different program offerings with a capacity of 300 students.\n\nOn December 15, 1969, Manitoba's three [[vocational-technical school]]s entered a new phase of development when they became community colleges. The Manitoba Vocational Training Centre was renamed Assiniboine Community College, the technical college in Winnipeg became [[Red River Community College]] (later renamed [[Red River College]]), and the technical college in [[The Pas]] became [[Keewatin Community College]] (later renamed [[University College of the North]]).\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Assiniboine Community College, Institute of Culinary Arts, Brandon MB Canada, 2009-09-19, formerly Nurses Residence of Brandon Mental Health Centre.jpg|thumb|Manitoba Institute of Culinary Arts, built in 1923 as a Nurses' Residence.]]\nACC has three campuses in Brandon, Manitoba. Currently, two-thirds of the college's students body in Brandon study at the Victoria Avenue East Campus, located at 1430 Victoria Avenue East. The college also runs an Adult Collegiate located in downtown Brandon, which came into operation in the fall of 1995 and offers adult upgrading for various senior high school courses. The college's North Hill Campus in Brandon is the location of the former Brandon Mental Health Centre. This location is home to the Manitoba Institute of Culinary Arts, the Len Evans Centre for Trades and Technology and the college's Sustainable Greenhouse.\n\nACC's Parkland Campus is located in Dauphin and offers several full-time day programs and a range of evening and off-campus courses. ACC's Winnipeg Campus is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and offers the Practical Nursing program and continuing studies courses. The college's Russell Training Centre is located in Russell, Manitoba and offers continuing studies and contract programs and courses\n\n==Relocation==\nAssiniboine Community College is relocating in phases from its Victoria Avenue East Campus, to what was formally called the Brandon Mental Health Centre on the North Hill. The second phase of this relocation has seen the trades programming moved to the new campus at the Len Evans Centre for Trades & Technology as of September 2010. The third phase will complete the move by relocating the remainder of Brandon-based programming into the Parkland building on the site.\n\n==Board of Governors==\nACC is governed by a Board of Governors as legislated in the Colleges and Consequential Amendments Act of the Province of [[Manitoba, Canada]]. The board is responsible to the Minister of Economic Development and Training and governors are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.

It is [[Higher education accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Higher education in Manitoba|Manitoba Council on Post-Secondary Education]], created by the [[government of Manitoba]].\n\nThe Victoria Avenue East campus and the Manitoba Institute of Culinary Arts are located in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]]. The Parkland Campus, a [[satellite campus]], is located in [[Dauphin, Manitoba|Dauphin]], and training sites are located in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Russell, Manitoba|Russell]], [[Neepawa, Manitoba|Neepawa]], [[Russell, Manitoba|Russell]], [[Swan River, Manitoba|Swan River]], and [[Steinbach, Manitoba|Steinbach]].\n\nACC offers over 30 programs in the fields of agriculture, environment, business, health and human services and trades and technology. The enabling legislation for the college is the Colleges Act.<ref>http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/c150-1e.php Colleges Act</ref>\n\n==Programs==\nACC offers diploma, certificate and  [[apprenticeship]] programs, the Manitoba [[Mature Student High School Diploma]] program, [[continuing education]] programs and contract training. The college's \"educational delivery\" is offered through a variety of approaches, including face-to-face, [[Distance education|distance]] and online, integrated programs and blended learning .\n\nThe college is known for its delivery of [[practical nurse]] training, delivering six offerings of the Practical Nursing program in Brandon, Winnipeg and two rural Manitoba communities since 2007-08.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.canlearn.ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526135850/http://tools.canlearn.ca/ |archivedate=2008-05-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\nACC offers programs in the following faculty:\n*School of [[Business]], [[Agriculture]] & [[Natural environment|Environment]] \n*School of [[Health]] & Human Services \n*School of Trades & Technology \n*Distance Education\n*Manitoba Institute of [[Culinary Arts]]\n*Mature Student High School Diploma (Manitoba Grade 12)\n*English as an Additional Language (EAL)\n\n==History==\nAssiniboine Community College was established as the '''Brandon Vocational Training Centre''', opening its doors in February 1961 with two course offerings, 24 students, and a staff of two administrative personnel and two instructors. Soon renamed the '''Manitoba Vocational Training Centre''', it grew steadily. By 1966, a staff of six administrative personnel and 18 instructors handled 11 different program offerings with a capacity of 300 students.\n\nOn December 15, 1969, Manitoba's three [[vocational-technical school]]s entered a new phase of development when they became community colleges. The Manitoba Vocational Training Centre was renamed Assiniboine Community College, the technical college in Winnipeg became [[Red River Community College]] (later renamed [[Red River College]]), and the technical college in [[The Pas]] became [[Keewatin Community College]] (later renamed [[University College of the North]]).\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Assiniboine Community College, Institute of Culinary Arts, Brandon MB Canada, 2009-09-19, formerly Nurses Residence of Brandon Mental Health Centre.jpg|thumb|Manitoba Institute of Culinary Arts, built in 1923 as a Nurses' Residence.]]\nACC has three campuses in Brandon, Manitoba. Currently, two-thirds of the college's students body in Brandon study at the Victoria Avenue East Campus, located at 1430 Victoria Avenue East. The college also runs an Adult Collegiate located in downtown Brandon, which came into operation in the fall of 1995 and offers adult upgrading for various senior high school courses. The college's North Hill Campus in Brandon is the location of the former Brandon Mental Health Centre. This location is home to the Manitoba Institute of Culinary Arts, the Len Evans Centre for Trades and Technology and the college's Sustainable Greenhouse.\n\nACC's Parkland Campus is located in Dauphin and offers several full-time day programs and a range of evening and off-campus courses. ACC's Winnipeg Campus is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and offers the Practical Nursing program and continuing studies courses. The college's Russell Training Centre is located in Russell, Manitoba and offers continuing studies and contract programs and courses\n\n==Relocation==\nAssiniboine Community College is relocating in phases from its Victoria Avenue East Campus, to what was formally called the Brandon Mental Health Centre on the North Hill. The second phase of this relocation has seen the trades programming moved to the new campus at the Len Evans Centre for Trades & Technology as of September 2010. The third phase will complete the move by relocating the remainder of Brandon-based programming into the Parkland building on the site.\n\n==Board of Governors==\nACC is governed by a Board of Governors as legislated in the Colleges and Consequential Amendments Act of the Province of [[Manitoba, Canada]]. The board is responsible to the Minister of Economic Development and Training and governors are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The ACC Board of Governors considers itself to be a policy board and has adopted a governing style that emphasizes outward vision, encourages diversity, provides strategic leadership and that clearly distinguishes between the work of the board and college staff.

{"title_page": "DU spectrophotometer", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n[[File:Spectrophotometer.jpg|thumb|right|DU Spectrophotometer, National Technical Laboratories, 1947]]\n\nThe '''DU spectrophotometer''' or '''Beckman DU''', introduced in 1941, was the first commercially viable [[scientific instrument]] for measuring the amount of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] absorbed by a substance. This model of [[spectrophotometer]] enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its [[absorption spectrum]], the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. [[Arnold Orville Beckman|Arnold O. Beckman]]'s [[National Technical Laboratories]] (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.\n\nSometimes referred to as a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer because it measured both the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectra, the DU spectrophotometer is credited as being a truly revolutionary technology. It yielded more accurate results than previous methods for determining the [[chemical composition]] of a complex substance, and substantially reduced the time needed for an accurate analysis from weeks or hours to minutes. The Beckman DU was essential to several critical secret research projects during [[World War II]], including the development of [[penicillin]] and [[synthetic rubber]].\n\n==Background==\nBefore the development of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a test sample to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process.

In developing the Model D, Beckman took the [[direct-coupled amplifier]] circuit from the pH meter and combined the optical and electronic components in a single housing, making it more economical.<ref name=\"Smutzer\"/>\n\nMoving from a prototype to production of the Model D involved challenges. \nBeckman originally approached [[Bausch and Lomb]] about making quartz prisms for the spectrophotometer. When they turned down the opportunity, National Technical Laboratories designed its own optical system, including both a control mechanism and a quartz prism. Large, high optical quality quartz suitable for creating prisms was difficult to obtain. It came from Brazil, and was in demand for wartime [[Crystal oscillator|radio oscillators]]. Beckman had to obtain a wartime priority listing for the spectrophotometer to get access to suitable quartz supplies.<ref name=\"Belser\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\nBeckman had previously attempted to find a source of reliable [[Deuterium arc lamp|hydrogen lamps]], seeking better sensitivity to wavelengths in the ultraviolet range than was possible with tungsten. As described in July 1941, the Beckman spectrophotomter could use a \"hot cathode hydrogen discharge tube\" or a tungsten light source interchangeably.<ref name=\"Cary\"/>{{rp|684\u2013685}} However, Beckman was still unsatisfied with the available hydrogen lamps.

This model of [[spectrophotometer]] enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its [[absorption spectrum]], the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. [[Arnold Orville Beckman|Arnold O. Beckman]]'s [[National Technical Laboratories]] (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.\n\nSometimes referred to as a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer because it measured both the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectra, the DU spectrophotometer is credited as being a truly revolutionary technology. It yielded more accurate results than previous methods for determining the [[chemical composition]] of a complex substance, and substantially reduced the time needed for an accurate analysis from weeks or hours to minutes. The Beckman DU was essential to several critical secret research projects during [[World War II]], including the development of [[penicillin]] and [[synthetic rubber]].\n\n==Background==\nBefore the development of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a test sample to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process.

An experienced human could compare these to the known images to identify a match. Then information from the plates had to be combined to create a graph showing the spectrum as a whole.

In developing the Model D, Beckman took the [[direct-coupled amplifier]] circuit from the pH meter and combined the optical and electronic components in a single housing, making it more economical.<ref name=\"Smutzer\"/>\n\nMoving from a prototype to production of the Model D involved challenges. \nBeckman originally approached [[Bausch and Lomb]] about making quartz prisms for the spectrophotometer. When they turned down the opportunity, National Technical Laboratories designed its own optical system, including both a control mechanism and a quartz prism. Large, high optical quality quartz suitable for creating prisms was difficult to obtain. It came from Brazil, and was in demand for wartime [[Crystal oscillator|radio oscillators]]. Beckman had to obtain a wartime priority listing for the spectrophotometer to get access to suitable quartz supplies.<ref name=\"Belser\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\nBeckman had previously attempted to find a source of reliable [[Deuterium arc lamp|hydrogen lamps]], seeking better sensitivity to wavelengths in the ultraviolet range than was possible with tungsten. As described in July 1941, the Beckman spectrophotomter could use a \"hot cathode hydrogen discharge tube\" or a tungsten light source interchangeably.<ref name=\"Cary\"/>{{rp|684\u2013685}} However, Beckman was still unsatisfied with the available hydrogen lamps.

The entrance mirror deflects the light through the entrance slit and into the monochromator to the collimating mirror. Light falling on the collimating mirror is rendered parallel and reflected to the quartz prism where it undergoes refraction. The back surface of the prism is aluminized so that light refracted at the first surface is reflected back through the prism, undergoing further refraction as it emerges from the prism. The desired wavelength of light is selected by rotating the Wavelength Selector which adjusts the position of the prism. The spectrum is directed back to the collimating mirror which centers the chosen wavelength on the exit slit and sample. Light passing through the sample strikes the phototube, causing a current gain.

Arguing that the political citizenship that was defined and enforced by the French Revolution was established by excluding certain categories of people from the [[social contract]], S\u00e9nac traces the progressive acceptance of non-brothers through the norm of their complementarity to enfranchised citizens, rather than their similarity to them or in recognition of any inherent rights.

Arguing that the political citizenship that was defined and enforced by the French Revolution was established by excluding certain categories of people from the [[social contract]], S\u00e9nac traces the progressive acceptance of non-brothers through the norm of their complementarity to enfranchised citizens, rather than their similarity to them or in recognition of any inherent rights.

Students are admitted in distinct cohorts, forming strong supportive units which learn and live together over the four years of the program. Only one cohort is in process at any time, with students moving together through the initial years and into the more advanced studies, relying on teaching from temporarily assigned professors from the judiciary, southern Canadian Universities, and the legal profession at large. In this way resources can be secured and opportunities developed appropriate to the cohort at each point in their learning and consistent with the small population based from which they are drawn.\n\nThe program for Akitsiraq I was taught as a modified law curriculum. The focus in the first year was to ensure academic success for the students. The [[University of Victoria Faculty of Law]] developed a Legal Research and Writing Course, which included an enhanced study skills component. The first year also exposed students to [[contract]], [[criminal law]] and Legal Processes courses.<ref name=akits/>\n\nIn the remaining three years, Akitsiraq I students were required to complete all the standard law courses. The Faculty of Law developed specialized elective courses for this program tailored to legal issues in the Canadian Arctic and the [[Inuit]], including [[Custom (law)|Inuit law]], [[environmental law]], northern resource land and management, the [[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]]. The expertise of local elders and educators incorporated [[Inuit Traditional Law]] and [[Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit]] throughout the four-year program.<ref name=akits/> Students were encouraged to participate during their final year in courses at the University of Victoria or other major Canadian University.\n\nThe Akitsiraq II program has continued to develop this approach, planning for two academic and one work term each year.  In addition, Akitsiraq II students will have the opportunity to participate with their contemporaries at the University of Ottawa Common Law Faculty each year in the intensive three week January intersession. The introductory program anticipated for June\u2013July 2011, is designed to orient students to the study of law, identify skill areas where additional support will be focused in the early program years, and provide a broad introduction to the classic first year study areas, as well as an initial exposure to the interface between Inuit Law and the Canadian legal tradition.\n\nIn order to practise as a lawyer, graduates of the program are required to article to a practising lawyer and pass a Bar Admission Test administered by a Canadian law society.\n\n==Funding==\nAkitsiraq I program was largely funded by the Government of Nunavut through the Departments of Education, Human Resources and Justice. Student financial support was based on salaried sponsorships through various agencies including the [[Nunavut#Government and politics|Government of Nunavut]], the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]], and several [[Non-profit organization|not for profit]] Inuit organizations. Student funding incorporated a requirements for attendance and post-graduation commitments to remain in their territory or province of origin (most were from Nunavut) and work for a minimum of two or four years following graduation.<ref name=akits/> As of 2010 all Akitsiraq I graduates are working or studying for graduate degrees in Nunavut (9), or in positions related to Nunavut (2).\n\nThe Akitsiraq II process has been funded to date by the Department of Justice Canada, in-kind supports from Justice Nunavut, Nunavut Arctic College and the resources of the University of Ottawa. The Society has contributed many hundreds of hours of volunteer support. The student funding model for Akitsiraq II has been designed to be individually based, with paid work-terms and diverse student financial supports, as well as the potential of incorporating specific program supports.\n\nThe Society is the guardian of significant unpublished materials on Inuit Law and continues to seek resources to develop these materials for broader access.\n\n==Outcome==\nParticipants in the Akitsiraq Jump-Start Program have continued to participate in legal fields.\n\nEleven people graduated from the Akitsiraq I program, receiving an LLB degree from the University of Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/06/21/nunavutlawyers050621.html |title= First Nunavut law class graduates on Aboriginal Day |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 2005-06-22}}</ref>  As of June 2009 nine of eleven graduates have been called to practise.

Forty-five students have attended the introductory Law Day information sessions across Nunavut and the Society reports over eighty potential students on its waiting lists.

In September 2017, the new program launched in cooperation with the [[University of Saskatchewan College of Law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.usask.ca/programs/nunavut-law-program.php|title=About the Nunavut Law Program|last=|first=|date=|website=law.usask.ca|publisher=[[University of Saskatchewan College of Law]]|language=en|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Curriculum==\nAkitsiraq operates on a cohort model. Students are admitted in distinct cohorts, forming strong supportive units which learn and live together over the four years of the program. Only one cohort is in process at any time, with students moving together through the initial years and into the more advanced studies, relying on teaching from temporarily assigned professors from the judiciary, southern Canadian Universities, and the legal profession at large. In this way resources can be secured and opportunities developed appropriate to the cohort at each point in their learning and consistent with the small population based from which they are drawn.\n\nThe program for Akitsiraq I was taught as a modified law curriculum. The focus in the first year was to ensure academic success for the students. The [[University of Victoria Faculty of Law]] developed a Legal Research and Writing Course, which included an enhanced study skills component. The first year also exposed students to [[contract]], [[criminal law]] and Legal Processes courses.<ref name=akits/>\n\nIn the remaining three years, Akitsiraq I students were required to complete all the standard law courses. The Faculty of Law developed specialized elective courses for this program tailored to legal issues in the Canadian Arctic and the [[Inuit]], including [[Custom (law)|Inuit law]], [[environmental law]], northern resource land and management, the [[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]]. The expertise of local elders and educators incorporated [[Inuit Traditional Law]] and [[Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit]] throughout the four-year program.<ref name=akits/> Students were encouraged to participate during their final year in courses at the University of Victoria or other major Canadian University.\n\nThe Akitsiraq II program has continued to develop this approach, planning for two academic and one work term each year.  In addition, Akitsiraq II students will have the opportunity to participate with their contemporaries at the University of Ottawa Common Law Faculty each year in the intensive three week January intersession. The introductory program anticipated for June\u2013July 2011, is designed to orient students to the study of law, identify skill areas where additional support will be focused in the early program years, and provide a broad introduction to the classic first year study areas, as well as an initial exposure to the interface between Inuit Law and the Canadian legal tradition.\n\nIn order to practise as a lawyer, graduates of the program are required to article to a practising lawyer and pass a Bar Admission Test administered by a Canadian law society.\n\n==Funding==\nAkitsiraq I program was largely funded by the Government of Nunavut through the Departments of Education, Human Resources and Justice. Student financial support was based on salaried sponsorships through various agencies including the [[Nunavut#Government and politics|Government of Nunavut]], the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]], and several [[Non-profit organization|not for profit]] Inuit organizations. Student funding incorporated a requirements for attendance and post-graduation commitments to remain in their territory or province of origin (most were from Nunavut) and work for a minimum of two or four years following graduation.<ref name=akits/> As of 2010 all Akitsiraq I graduates are working or studying for graduate degrees in Nunavut (9), or in positions related to Nunavut (2).\n\nThe Akitsiraq II process has been funded to date by the Department of Justice Canada, in-kind supports from Justice Nunavut, Nunavut Arctic College and the resources of the University of Ottawa. The Society has contributed many hundreds of hours of volunteer support. The student funding model for Akitsiraq II has been designed to be individually based, with paid work-terms and diverse student financial supports, as well as the potential of incorporating specific program supports.\n\nThe Society is the guardian of significant unpublished materials on Inuit Law and continues to seek resources to develop these materials for broader access.\n\n==Outcome==\nParticipants in the Akitsiraq Jump-Start Program have continued to participate in legal fields.\n\nEleven people graduated from the Akitsiraq I program, receiving an LLB degree from the University of Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/06/21/nunavutlawyers050621.html |title= First Nunavut law class graduates on Aboriginal Day |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 2005-06-22}}</ref>  As of June 2009 nine of eleven graduates have been called to practise. This is consistent with or exceeds success rates in southern Canadian university law programs.\n\nOne of the graduates became the first Inuk selected to article as a clerk at the Supreme Court of Canada, under Mme Justice [[Louise Charron]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Others are engaged in Masters of Law programs, practising family and civil law, prosecuting, acting as counsel to aboriginal organizations, and government agencies, working in the RCMP and with Inuktitut language initiatives.\n\nStudent admissions initiatives are still underway for Akitsiraq II. Forty-five students have attended the introductory Law Day information sessions across Nunavut and the Society reports over eighty potential students on its waiting lists. There is the potential for student admissions from Nunatsiavik and Nunavik.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Higher education in Nunavut]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100220130655/http://www.akitsiraq.ca/ Akitsiraq Law School]\n*[http://communications.uvic.ca/releases/release.php?display=back&id=70]\n*[http://www.commonlaw.uottawa.ca/ University of Ottawa, Faculty of Law - Akitsiraq II Law Program]\n*[http://www.nac.nu.ca/ Arctic College]\n{{Universities in Canada}}\n{{Can-terr-colleges}}\n{{Nunavut}}\n{{North American Tribal Colleges and Universities}}\n{{Canadian law}}\n{{Canadian law schools}}\n\n[[Category:Colleges in the territories of Canada]]\n[[Category:Law schools in Canada]]\n[[Category:Indigenous universities and colleges in North America]]\n[[Category:First Nations education]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2001]]\n[[Category:Education in Iqaluit]]\n[[Category:2001 establishments in Nunavut]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitsiraq_Law_School"}
