During the war, Habsburg armies and the [[Serbian Militia (1718\u201339)|Serbian Militia]] failed to achieve substantial success, and subsequently were forced to retreat. By 1739, entire territory of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u20131739)|Kingdom of Serbia]] was lost to Ottomans. During the war, large portion of Christian population from the region of Ra\u0161ka and other Serbian lands migrated towards the north, following the retreat of Habsburg armies and the Serbian Militia.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, iectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800. At the first the Formation Wasn\u00b4t identifed as a separated unit. The first fossils where recovered on several Collections, some since the Modern Age, present on localities like the Banz Abbey.

Geobios 35, 13\u201320.</ref> The Black Shales present on the Posidonia Fm are related to deposits present on Lithuania, Canada and several other countries & Continents. This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter. It\u00b4s related to a change in carbon-isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial life, and was probably a perturbator of the carbon cycle.<ref>Brumsack, H. J. (1991).

Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, iectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation.

Geobios 35, 13\u201320.</ref> The Black Shales present on the Posidonia Fm are related to deposits present on Lithuania, Canada and several other countries & Continents. This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter. It\u00b4s related to a change in carbon-isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial life, and was probably a perturbator of the carbon cycle.<ref>Brumsack, H. J. (1991).

Waters interchange were on of the major effects on the paulatine de-oxygenation showed on most of the Lower Toarcian Layers around the word, with the connection with the Viking Corridor as one of the main effects, due to the arctic waters freshening and breaking the oceanic circulation.<ref>Dera, G., & Donnadieu, Y.
