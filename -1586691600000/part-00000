It tells the story of a working-class young man who is entangled with two women: one who works in his wealthy uncle's factory, and the other a beautiful socialite. Another adaptation of the novel had been filmed once before, as ''[[An American Tragedy (film)|An American Tragedy]]'', in 1931.  All these works were inspired by the real-life [[murder of Grace Brown]] by [[Chester Gillette]] in 1906, which resulted in Gillette's conviction and execution by electric chair in 1908.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/nyregion/11tragedy.html</ref> \n\n''A Place in the Sun'' was directed by [[George Stevens]] from a screenplay by [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], and stars [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Shelley Winters]]; its supporting actors included [[Anne Revere]], and [[Raymond Burr]].<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; July 18, 1951, p. 6.</ref><ref>''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; July 21, 1951, p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, winning six [[Academy Awards]] and the first-ever [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]]. In 1991, ''A Place in the Sun'' was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950, George Eastman ([[Montgomery Clift]]), the poor nephew of rich industrialist Charles Eastman ([[Herbert Heyes]]), arrives in town following a chance encounter with his uncle while working as a [[bellhop]] in a Chicago hotel. The elder Eastman invites George to visit him if and when he ever comes to town, and the ambitious young man takes advantage of the offer. Despite George's family relationship to the Eastmans, they regard him as something of an outsider, but his uncle nevertheless offers him an entry-level job at his factory. George, uncomplaining, hopes to impress his uncle (whom he addresses as \"Mr. Eastman\") with his hard work and earn his way up. While working in the factory, George starts dating fellow factory worker Alice Tripp ([[Shelley Winters]]), in defiance of the workplace rules. Alice is a poor and inexperienced girl who is dazzled by George and slow to believe that his Eastman name brings him no advantages.\n\nOver time, George begins a slow move up the corporate ladder into a supervisory position in the department where he began. He has submitted recommendations on improving production in his department, which finally catch the attention of his uncle, who invites him to their home for a social event. At the party, George finally meets \"society girl\" Angela Vickers ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]), whom he has admired from afar since shortly after arriving in town, and they quickly fall in love. Being Angela's escort thrusts George into the intoxicating and care-free lifestyle of high society that his rich Eastman kin had denied him. When Alice announces that she is pregnant and makes it clear that she expects George to marry her, he puts her off, spending more and more of his time with Angela and his new well-heeled friends. An attempt to procure an abortion for Alice fails, and she renews her insistence on marriage. George is invited to join Angela at the Vickers's holiday lake house over [[Labor Day]] and excuses himself to Alice, saying that the visit will advance his career and accrue to the benefit of the coming child.\n \nGeorge and Angela spend time at secluded Loon Lake, where Angela tells George the story of a couple's supposed drowning there, with the man's body never being found.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice finds a picture in the newspaper of George and Angela boating with friends, and realizes that George lied to her about his intentions for wanting to go to the lake. During a dinner which is attended by the Eastman and Vickers families, George appears to be on the verge of finally advancing into the business and social realm that he has long sought. However, Alice phones the house during the dinner party and asks to speak with George. She tells him that she is at the bus station and that if he does not come to get her, she will come to where he is and expose him. Visibly shaken, he announces to the families that his mother is ill and that he must leave, but promises Angela that he will return. The next morning, George and Alice drive to City Hall to get married but they find it closed for Labor Day. George is relieved. Remembering the story Angela had told him about the drowned couple, and knowing that Alice can't swim, George suggests spending the day at the nearby lake; Alice unsuspectingly agrees.\n\nWhen they get to the lake, George pulls the car's choke to feign it being out of gas in order to hide the car in the woods. He acts nervously when he rents a boat from a man who seems to deduce that George gave him a false name; the man's suspicions are aroused more when George asks him whether any other boaters are on the lake (none are). While they are out on the lake, Alice confesses her dreams about their happy future together with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.\n\nGeorge escapes, swims to shore, suspiciously confronts campers on his way back to the car, and eventually drives to the Vickers' lodge. There, he tries to relax, but is increasingly tense. He says nothing to anyone about having been on the lake or about what happened there. Meanwhile, Alice's body is discovered and her death is treated as a murder almost from the first moment, while an abundant amount of evidence and witness reports stack up against George. Just as Angela's father approves Angela's marriage to him, George is arrested and charged with Alice's murder. George's furtive actions before and after Alice's death condemn him. His denials are futile, and he is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Near the end, he agrees when the priest suggests that, although he did not kill Alice, he did not act to save her because he was thinking of Angela. The priest then states that, in his heart, it was murder.\n\nLater, Angela visits George in prison, saying that she will always love him, and George slowly marches toward his execution.\n\n==Censorship==\n\nIn a November 14, 1949 letter from the [[Production Code Administration]], [[Joseph I. Breen]] pointed out an issue regarding the dialogue between Alice and her doctor. Breen cautioned against direct references to abortion, specifically the line in the script in which Alice says, \"Doctor, you've got to help me.\" In the finished film, the line became, \"Somebody's got to help me\", and while abortion is possibly implied, the film does not include any actual mention of it.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4789/A-Place-in-the-Sun/notes.html ''Turner Classic Movies'' - Entry for: ''A Place in the Sun'' TCM.com]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as George Eastman\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Angela Vickers\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Alice Tripp\n* [[Anne Revere]] as Hannah Eastman\n* [[Keefe Brasselle]] as Earl Eastman\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Bellows, defense attorney\n* [[Raymond Burr]] as Dist.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player.

The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.  Stanley\u2019s no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\n=== Camp Green Lake ===\nThe Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \"interesting\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley befriends Zero, a [[street child]] and a descendant of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago. The inmates are assigned to dig one hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \"builds their character\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\n=== Camp Green Lake ===\nThe Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \"interesting\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley befriends Zero, a [[street child]] and a descendant of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005.

The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.\n\n===2009 revisions===\nThe Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda. Unlike the previous generation - which adopted a 70 PS 1.4 ''[[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]]'' inline four - it is powered by the turbocharged, 0.9 liter, two-cylinder ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.
