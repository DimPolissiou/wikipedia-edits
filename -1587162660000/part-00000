{"title_page": "Early life of Shivaji", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2014}}\n[[File:Raje Shivaji with mother Jijamata.jpg|thumb|A modern statue of a young Shivaji with his mother [[Jijabai]]]]\n[[Shivaji]] was the founder of the [[Maratha Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The '''early life of Shivaji''' is a topic of great interest in the popular culture of [[India]], especially in the [[Maharashtra]] state, where he spent most of his life. This article describes Shivaji's life from his birth until the age of 19 years (1630-1649).\n\nShivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]] on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]] used by the contemporary English traders in India. At the time of his birth, the families of his father [[Shahaji]] and his mother [[Jijabai]] both served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]] in military and administrative capacities, although they subsequently transferred their allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] at different times.\n\nAs a servant of Bijapur, Shahaji was deputed in southern [[Deccan]] after 1636, and did not see Shivaji for several years. Shivaji and his mother remained in Pune in northern Deccan, where Shahaji's subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] administered the family's ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal land grant) in Shivaji's name. As a teenager, Shivaji started acting independently of the Bijapur government, against the advice of Shahaji and Dadoji. He captured several hill forts at the expense of other vassals of Bijapur, and by the age of 15, started calling himself a ''[[raja]]'' (king).\n\nAfter Dadoji's death in 1647, Shivaji assumed full control of his father's ''jagir'' in the Pune region, and eliminated local challenges to his authority. He then invaded the northern [[Konkan]] region, making inroads into the territory of the [[Janjira State|Siddis of Janjira]]. He subsequently tried to form an alliance with Mughals against Bijapur, and ultimately ended up fighting both these powers to establish a kingdom that evolved into the [[Maratha Empire]].\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Shivneri Shiv Mandir.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Shivaji's birthplace on Shivneri Fort]]\n\nMost of the earliest surviving records of Shivaji's childhood were composed around 150 years after his birth. These records, especially the Marathi-language ''[[bakhar]]s'', contain several stories that are historically unreliable.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=19-20}}\n\nShivaji was born to [[Shahaji]] and [[Jijabai]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} at the time of the severe Mahadurga famine in the Maharashtra region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46}} He had an elder brother named [[Sambhaji (brother of Shivaji)|Sambhaji]], and his parents had lost several other children in infancy.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} Shivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and his mother named him after Shivai, a local goddess.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nShivaji was born on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]]. The British records in India used the Julian calendar until 1752 CE, when it was replaced by the [[Gregorian calendar]]; as a result, several historical records and books mention his birthdate as 19 February instead of 1 March.{{sfn|Mohan Apte et al.|2003|pp=21-22}} Historically, there was some debate about this date, because the ''[[Jedhe Shakawali|Jedhe chronology]]'' - records maintained by the Jedhe family, whose ancestors served as [[Deshmukh]]s of Kari - places Shivaji's birth in 1627. However, the 1630 date is corroborated by a copy of his birth horoscope found in Rajasthan,{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and a poem composed by his courtier Parmanand.{{sfn|D. F. Karaka|1969|p=viii}}\n\n''Shiva-bharata'', a poem by Shivaji's court poet Paramananda, presents Shivaji as a divine incarnation, stating that the god [[Vishnu]] visited Jijabai in a dream, and then \"a portion\" of Vishnu entered her womb as Shivaji.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|pp=31-32}} The poem also claims that during her pregnancy, Jijabai had cravings indicative of a child with royal and martial characteristics, such as to sit on a golden throne, and to lead men to battle victories.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\n== Ancestry and self-identity ==\n[[File:Shivaji jijamata.JPG|thumb|right|A statue of Shivaji and Jijabai installed at [[Shivneri]] in the 1960s]]\nShivaji's father [[Shahji]] belonged to the [[Bhonsle]] clan, which traced its patrilinear ancestry to the [[Sisodia]] [[Rajput]] royal family of [[Mewar]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=35}} His mother Jijabai came from the aristocratic [[Lakhuji Jadhav|Jadhav]] family, which traced its lineage to the [[Yadavas of Devagiri]].{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nAlthough characterized as a [[Maratha (caste)|Maratha]] in modern times, Shivaji probably identified himself as a Rajput, as suggested by contemporary Rajput newsletters, and a letter of his father [[Shahaji]] which calls his family Rajput.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=88}} An English letter by the [[East India Company]] [[factor (agent)|factor]] Henry Revington, dated 10 December 1659, also calls Shivaji a \"Great Rajput\".{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=53}} During his coronation in 1674, Shivaji's royal priest [[Gaga Bhatta]] presented him as a member of the [[Kshatriya]] [[solar dynasty]], counting the Sisodia Rajputs among his ancestors. The claim is also supported by ''Shiva-bharata'', a text composed at Shivaji's court.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\nHistorian Bal Krishna, relying on some ''[[firman]]s'' in possession of the chiefs of [[Mudhol]] (who claimed a shared ancestry with Shivaji), traced the ancestry of Shivaji to the Sisodia chief Lakshmasimha, who died at the [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)]] against [[Alauddin Khalji]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|pp=37-42}} However, these documents are of doubtful authenticity, and considered spurious by other historians.{{sfn|A. G. Pawar|1976|p=160}}{{sfn|Krishna Swaroop Gupta|1971|p=18}}\n\n== Before Pune ==\n\nShivaji's father Shahaji was a military leader in the [[Deccan]] region. During Shivaji's childhood, the present-day Maharashtra area in Deccan saw constant warfare between the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]], and suffered from famine.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} When his parents married, both their families served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]]. By the time of Shivaji's birth, Jijabai's family had deserted Ahemdnagar, transferring its allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], thus becoming an opponent of Shahaji. A few years later, Shahaji also deserted Ahmednagar;{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} he briefly served the Mughal Empire, but later rebelled against them, supported by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]]. Meanwhile, Jijabai's family remained loyal to the Mughals;{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} her father was later assassinated by the nobles of Ahmadnagar.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nDuring the Mughal invasion of Ahmadnagar in the 1630s, Shahaji fought against the Mughals.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46-47}} He was pursued by a Mughal force, and therefore, Shivaji and his mother moved from fort to fort, and Shivaji rarely saw his father.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After the fall of Ahmadnagar in 1636, the Mughals concluded a peace treaty with Bijapur. As part of this treaty, Bijapur agreed to help the Mughals subjugate Shahaji, or to depute him away from the Mughal frontier if he chose to join the Bijapuri service.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=205}} Shahaji joined the Bijapuri service: he was allowed to retain his jagir in the Pune region, but was barred from living in that area as part of the treaty. He was deputed in southern India, and his ''jagir'' in the Pune region was placed under the nominal administration of his minor son Shivaji, with his subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] as its manager.{{sfn|Sumit Guha|2011|p=57}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}}\n\n== In Pune ==\n\nAs part of the peace treaty with the Mughals, Shahaji ceded six forts, including Shivneri, to them in October 1636.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=22}} He directed Dadoji Kondadeo to bring Jijabai and Shivaji from Shivneri to Pune, and take care of their expenses.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shivaji spent his formative years at Pune.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}} Meanwhile, Shahaji departed for south, and did not see Shivaji for several years. In absence of his father, Shivaji grew very close to his mother.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Neglected by her husband, Jijabai led a deeply religious - almost ascetic - life, and this religious environment had a profound influence on Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=21, 29}}\n\nShahaji's land grant in the [[Pune district|Pune]] region included the ''[[patil (title)|patil]]'' (village chief) rights to three villages, the ''[[deshmukh]]'' rights of [[Indapur]], and the ''[[jagir|mokasa]]'' (revenue collection in exchange for military service) rights of Pune region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|pp=59-60}} The ''mokasa'' land granted to Shahaji was a triangular region bounded by the [[Western Ghats]] in the west, the [[Bhima River]] in the north-east, and the [[Nira River]] in the south.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} This region had been devastated by constant warfare between Shahaji, Bijapur, and the Mughals in the 1630s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=23-24}} Dadoji tried to increase the regional revenue yield by offering cheap land leases and rewards to kill wolves, so that more land could be brought under agricultural use.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=24}} He organized a group of local soldiers to maintan law and order.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Dadoji took possession of lands controlled by twelve ''deshmukhs'' of the [[Maval|Mawal]] region, and had those who resisted killed.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', Shivaji captured and killed Krishnaji Nayak Bandal, a ''deshmukh'' of Hirdas Maval area whom Dadoji had failed to subjugate. Historian Jadunath Sarkar believes this to be incorrect, and states that it was Dadoji who completed the subjugatation of the Maval ''deshmukhs''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}}\n\n== Education and training ==\n\nShivaji's early training probably included what was expected of the son of a ''[[jagirdar]]'': some reading and writing, horse-riding, martial arts, and religious practice.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} According to ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Dadoji personally trained Shivaji, and also appointed a good teacher for him.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} As a result, Shivaji became skilled in \"fighting, riding, and other accomplishments\".{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' does not mention anything about Shivaji being taught to read and write. The ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' (c. 1811) states that Shivaji had become \"very learned\" by the age of 10 years. ''Shiva-digivjaya'' claims that he mastered several arts and sciences as a boy.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}} Historian Jadunath Sarkar notes that several Europeans visited Shivaji's court, and their accounts do not mention any reading or writing by Shivaji. Whenever these Europeans presented any letter to Shivaji, he would pass it on to his ministers for reading. Therefore, Sarkar concludes that Shivaji was illiterate like many other rulers of medieval India, such as [[Akbar]], [[Hyder Ali]], and [[Ranjit Singh]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\nWhether or not Shivaji was literate, he listened to the recitations of the Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The political and moral lessions from these epics greatly impressed his young mind. He was deeply interested in religious teachings, and sought the society of Hindu and Muslim saints wherever he went.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n== Alienation from father ==\n\nEven when Shahaji was in northern Deccan, Shivaji and his mother Jijabai rarely saw him, because of Shahaji's military preoccupations.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After Shahaji was deputed in the south, the father and son did not see each other for several years.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shahaji became Bijapur's governor of [[Bangalore]] in the south, and married another woman - Tukabai.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} Shivaji's elder brother Sambhaji moved to Bangalore,{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} but Shivaji and Jijabai were called to Bangalore only in 1640. Meanwhile, Shivaji married [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]], a member of the prominent Nimbalkar Maratha family. In 1642, Shivaji and his mother returned to Pune, after a formal presentation at the Bijapur court.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to a doubtful narrative in ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Shahaji had developed a deep dislike for Jijabai's father Lakhuji Jadhav. After the death of his eldest son Sambhaji (or Shambhuji) at Kanakagiri in 1654, he declared that Shivaji - his surviving son from Lakhuji's daughter - would be no good. He then deserted Jijabai and Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=20}} Whatever the accuracy of this account, it is known from other texts that Shahji's wealth and affection were directed to [[Vyankoji]] alias Ekoji, his son from his younger wife Tukabai.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}}\n\n== Early conquests ==\n\nShivaji's earliest comrades and followers, called the Mavales, came from the [[Maval]] region around his Pune ''jagir''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} As a teenager, Shivaji explored the hilly area surrounding his ''jagir'' and became familiar with the [[Western Ghats]] region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} [[Mohammed Adil Shah, Sultan of Bijapur|Muhammad Adil Shah]], the king of Bijapur, remained ill during the last decade of his life (1646-1656). During this time, the administration was largely handled by his queen, titled ''Bari Sahiba''. Taking advantage of the instability, Shivaji captured several forts in the Bijapur territory.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nBy the time he was 15 years old, Shivaji called himself a \"king\" (''raja''). By this time, he commanded over a thousand soldiers,  In a letter to a Hindu official, dated 17 April 1645, he wrote that the God wished them to be independent under a self-ruled state.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}}\n\nEven before Dadoji's death, during 1645-1647, Shivaji captured several hill forts around Pune, including Rajgarh, Kondana (later [[Sinhagad]]) and Torna.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nIn 1646, he sent an infantry led by Baji Pasalkar, Yesaji Kank, and Tanaji Malusare to take control of the [[Torna Fort]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}} According to different historical texts, Shivaji's army captured the fort after tricking or bribing the local Bijapuri commander.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} Shivaji seized the local government treasury worth 200,000 ''hon'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), and renamed the fort Prachandagarh, although this name did not stick for long.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}} He built the [[Rajgad Fort]] near Torna, with three walled [[redoubt]]s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\nThe local ''jagirdars'' whom Shivaji had dispossessed complained to the Bijapur court against him. According to Khafi Khan's ''[[Muntakhab-al Lubab]]'', Shivaji bribed some court ministers to get these complaints dismissed. According to the ''Chitnis Bakhar'', Shahaji assured the king of Shivaji's loyalty, and justified Shivaji's control of Torna fort by arguing that the earlier administrator of the fort was negligient. Meanwhile, in secretly reprimanded Shivaji in a letter, and ordered Dadoji to keep him under control.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}}\n\n== After Dadoji ==\n\nDadoji advised Shivaji to rise in rank and wealth an obedient vassal of the Deccan Sultanates, but Shivaji wanted to act independently. Dadoji was greatly concerned about Shivaji's associations with hill brigands and his plans to rob forts. Dadoji complained to Shahaji, but did not succeed in changing Shivaji's behavior.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} The ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' states that Dadoji committed suicide by poison, because he was disgusted with Shivaji's waywardness.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n\nShivaji probably participated in Dadoji Kondadeo's administration of Shahji's Pune ''[[jagir]]''.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} During his last years, Dadoji had started issuing administrative orders in Shivaji's name.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}} When Dadoji died in 1647, Shivaji assumed the full control of his father's ''jagir''.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nHis officers included:\n\n* Appointed by Shahaji around 1639:\n** Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar (or Rozekar), ''peshwa'' (Chancellor){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Balkrishna Dikshit, ''majumdar'' (Accountant-General){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Somaji Pant, ''dabir'' (Secretary){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Raghunath Ballal Korde, ''sabnis'' (Paymaster){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n* Appointed by Shivaji\n** Tukoji Chor Maratha, ''sar-i-naubat'' (Commander-in-Chief){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Narayan Pant, divisional paymaster{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\n=== Consolidation of control around Pune ===\n\nAfter Dadoji's death, Shivaji started consolidating his control over Shahaji's ''jagir'' around the Pune region. Dadoji had assigned the administration of the Supe ''mahal'' (subdivision) to Shambhuji (or Sambhaji) Mohite, the brother of Shahaji's second wife Tukabai. After Dadoji's death, Shambhuji refused to take orders from Shivaji, declaring that he would report directly to Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Shivaji visited Shambhuji during the [[Holi|Shimga]] festival on the pretext of asking for a post, and imprisoned him. Shivaji confiscated all his property, including 300 horses, personal belongings including clothes, and other wealth.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} When Sambhaji still refused recognize Shivaji's authority, Shivaji forcibly annexed Supe and sent Shambhuji to Shahaji with his personal property.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=33-34}}\n\nShortly after the annexation of Supe, Shivaji raided [[Junnar]], where he captured 300 horses, goods worth 300 ''hons'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), clothes, and jewels.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n[[Firangoji Narsala]], who had been appointed as the administrator of the [[Chakan Fort]], accepted Shivaji's authority.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} The commanders of [[Baramati]] and [[Indapur]] also recognized his authority.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nThe ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'' states that Shivaji took control of the [[Kondana]] Fort by bribing its Bijapuri governor.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nThe Purandar Fort of Bijapur Sultante was administered by Nilo Nilkanth Nayak, a Brahmin whose family had controlled the fort and its surrounding area for several years. His younger brothers Pilaji and Shankaraji resented being excluded from their hereditary rights to the fort, and requested Shivaji to arbitrate. Shivaji entered the fort as a guest during the [[Diwali]] celebrations, and three days later, the younger brothers imprisoned Nilo and brought him before Shivaji. Shivaji imprisoned all three brothers, and took control of the fort himself.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' and ''[[Shiva Digvijaya]]'', he later granted estates at other places to the younger brothers as compensation.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=34-35}} He expelled Nilo Nayak's subordinates from the fort, and replaced them with his own men.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nSubsequently, Shivaji also acquired control of several other forts around Pune, including [[Rohida fort|Rohira]], [[Tikona]], [[Rajmachi]], and [[Lohagad]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}}\n\n=== In Konkan ===\n\nAfter consolidating his control over Pune, Shivaji crossed the [[Western Ghats]], and entered the [[Konkan]] region on the western coast of India. The [[Kalyan]] ''jagir'' in this region was under the control of by Mulla Ahmad, a [[Nawaiyat]] Muslim of [[Arabs|Arab]] origin. The region had been recently acquired by the Bijapur Sultanate after the decline of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]], and Mulla Ahmad - who was considered a foreigner by the locals - remained away at [[Bijapur]]. Because of this, the administration of the ''jagir'' had become inefficient.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}} Shivaji sent a cavalry led by Abaji Sondev to conquer the Kalyan ''jagir''. The cavalry plundered much wealth and merchandise from the non-fortified towns of Kalyan and [[Bhiwandi]], and captured the [[Mahuli]] fort which was once under the control of Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}}\n\nOver the next year (1648), Shivaji consolidated his control in northern Konkan, establishing authority over local chiefs and capturing territories from the [[Siddi]]s of [[Janjira State|Janjira]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} The Siddis had become practically independent after the fall of their former overlords - the kings of [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], although they recognized the nominal suzerainty of Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=293-294}} From Kalyan, Shivaji moved southwards towards [[Kolaba Fort|Kolaba]]: several local Hindu chiefs invited him to their territories. He captured [[Surgad]], [[Birwadi]], [[Tala, Raigad|Tala]], [[Ghosale gad|Ghosalegad]], [[Sudhagad]], [[Kangori]], and [[Raigad Fort|Rairi]] (Raigad, his future capital). He built new forts at [[Birwadi fort|Birwadi]] and [[Lingana]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} Shivaji appointed Abaji Sondev as the viceroy of this newly-conquered territory in northern Konkan.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nSometime in 1648, the Siddis inflicted a crushing defeat on Shivaji's forces led by the ''[[Peshwa]]'' Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar. According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', a displeased Shivaji removed Ranjhekar from his post, and appointed [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] as the new Peshwa. He also sent a large army led by Raghunath Ballal Korde against the Siddis.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nIn late 1648, the Bijapuri government imprisoned Shivaji's father Shahaji.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-39}} According to Zahur's ''Muhammad-namah'' (the official court history of Bijapur) and ''Basatin-i-Salatin'' (a later history), Shahaji was arrested for insubordination during the siege of [[Gingee Fort|Jinji]] against the [[Golconda Sultanate]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=38-39}} However, ''Chitnis Bakhar'', a Maratha chronicle written over 150 years after the event, states that Shahaji was arrested because the Bijapuri court suspected him to be involved in the rebellious activities of his son Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-38}}\n\nWhile his father was imprisoned at Bijapur, Bijapuri government sent an army to recapture Purandar from Shivaji, but this force was unable to dislodge Shivaji from the fort.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=62}} Meanwhile, Shivaji unsuccessfully attempted to forge an alliance with the Mughals against Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lal Mahal]], the residential palace where Shivaji stayed during his early life\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite book |author=A.

The '''early life of Shivaji''' is a topic of great interest in the popular culture of [[India]], especially in the [[Maharashtra]] state, where he spent most of his life. This article describes Shivaji's life from his birth until the age of 19 years (1630-1649).\n\nShivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]] on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]] used by the contemporary English traders in India. At the time of his birth, the families of his father [[Shahaji]] and his mother [[Jijabai]] both served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]] in military and administrative capacities, although they subsequently transferred their allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] at different times.\n\nAs a servant of Bijapur, Shahaji was deputed in southern Deccan after 1636, and did not see Shivaji for several years. Shivaji and his mother remained in Pune in northern [[Deccan]], where Shahaji's subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] administered the family's ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal land grant) in Shivaji's name. As a teenager, Shivaji started acting independently of the Bijapur government, against the advice of Shahaji and Dadoji. He captured several hill forts at the expense of other vassals of Bijapur, and by the age of 15, started calling himself a ''[[raja]]'' (king).\n\nAfter Dadoji's death in 1647, Shivaji assumed full control of his father's ''jagir'' in the Pune region, and eliminated local challenges to his authority. He then invaded the northern [[Konkan]] region, making inroads into the territory of the [[Janjira State|Siddis of Janjira]]. He subsequently tried to form an alliance with Mughals against Bijapur, and ultimately ended up fighting both these powers to establish a kingdom that evolved into the [[Maratha Empire]].\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Shivneri Shiv Mandir.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Shivaji's birthplace on Shivneri Fort]]\n\nMost of the earliest surviving records of Shivaji's childhood were composed around 150 years after his birth. These records, especially the Marathi-language ''[[bakhar]]s'', contain several stories that are historically unreliable.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=19-20}}\n\nShivaji was born to [[Shahaji]] and [[Jijabai]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} at the time of the severe Mahadurga famine in the Maharashtra region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46}} He had an elder brother named [[Sambhaji (brother of Shivaji)|Sambhaji]], and his parents had lost several other children in infancy.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} Shivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and his mother named him after Shivai, a local goddess.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nShivaji was born on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]]. The British records in India used the Julian calendar until 1752 CE, when it was replaced by the [[Gregorian calendar]]; as a result, several historical records and books mention his birthdate as 19 February instead of 1 March.{{sfn|Mohan Apte et al.|2003|pp=21-22}} Historically, there was some debate about this date, because the ''[[Jedhe Shakawali|Jedhe chronology]]'' - records maintained by the Jedhe family, whose ancestors served as [[Deshmukh]]s of Kari - places Shivaji's birth in 1627. However, the 1630 date is corroborated by a copy of his birth horoscope found in Rajasthan,{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and a poem composed by his courtier Parmanand.{{sfn|D. F. Karaka|1969|p=viii}}\n\n''Shiva-bharata'', a poem by Shivaji's court poet Paramananda, presents Shivaji as a divine incarnation, stating that the god [[Vishnu]] visited Jijabai in a dream, and then \"a portion\" of Vishnu entered her womb as Shivaji.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|pp=31-32}} The poem also claims that during her pregnancy, Jijabai had cravings indicative of a child with royal and martial characteristics, such as to sit on a golden throne, and to lead men to battle victories.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\n== Ancestry and self-identity ==\n[[File:Shivaji jijamata.JPG|thumb|right|A statue of Shivaji and Jijabai installed at [[Shivneri]] in the 1960s]]\nShivaji's father [[Shahji]] belonged to the [[Bhonsle]] clan, which traced its patrilinear ancestry to the [[Sisodia]] [[Rajput]] royal family of [[Mewar]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=35}} His mother Jijabai came from the aristocratic [[Lakhuji Jadhav|Jadhav]] family, which traced its lineage to the [[Yadavas of Devagiri]].{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nAlthough characterized as a [[Maratha (caste)|Maratha]] in modern times, Shivaji probably identified himself as a Rajput, as suggested by contemporary Rajput newsletters, and a letter of his father [[Shahaji]] which calls his family Rajput.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=88}} An English letter by the [[East India Company]] [[factor (agent)|factor]] Henry Revington, dated 10 December 1659, also calls Shivaji a \"Great Rajput\".{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=53}} During his coronation in 1674, Shivaji's royal priest [[Gaga Bhatta]] presented him as a member of the [[Kshatriya]] [[solar dynasty]], counting the Sisodia Rajputs among his ancestors. The claim is also supported by ''Shiva-bharata'', a text composed at Shivaji's court.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\nHistorian Bal Krishna, relying on some ''[[firman]]s'' in possession of the chiefs of [[Mudhol]] (who claimed a shared ancestry with Shivaji), traced the ancestry of Shivaji to the Sisodia chief Lakshmasimha, who died at the [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)]] against [[Alauddin Khalji]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|pp=37-42}} However, these documents are of doubtful authenticity, and considered spurious by other historians.{{sfn|A. G. Pawar|1976|p=160}}{{sfn|Krishna Swaroop Gupta|1971|p=18}}\n\n== Before Pune ==\n\nShivaji's father Shahaji was a military leader in the [[Deccan]] region. During Shivaji's childhood, the present-day Maharashtra area in Deccan saw constant warfare between the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]], and suffered from famine.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} When his parents married, both their families served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]]. By the time of Shivaji's birth, Jijabai's family had deserted Ahemdnagar, transferring its allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], thus becoming an opponent of Shahaji. A few years later, Shahaji also deserted Ahmednagar;{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} he briefly served the Mughal Empire, but later rebelled against them, supported by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]]. Meanwhile, Jijabai's family remained loyal to the Mughals;{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} her father was later assassinated by the nobles of Ahmadnagar.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nDuring the Mughal invasion of Ahmadnagar in the 1630s, Shahaji fought against the Mughals.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46-47}} He was pursued by a Mughal force, and therefore, Shivaji and his mother moved from fort to fort, and Shivaji rarely saw his father.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After the fall of Ahmadnagar in 1636, the Mughals concluded a peace treaty with Bijapur. As part of this treaty, Bijapur agreed to help the Mughals subjugate Shahaji, or to depute him away from the Mughal frontier if he chose to join the Bijapuri service.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=205}} Shahaji joined the Bijapuri service: he was allowed to retain his jagir in the Pune region, but was barred from living in that area as part of the treaty. He was deputed in southern India, and his ''jagir'' in the Pune region was placed under the nominal administration of his minor son Shivaji, with his subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] as its manager.{{sfn|Sumit Guha|2011|p=57}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}}\n\n== In Pune ==\n\nAs part of the peace treaty with the Mughals, Shahaji ceded six forts, including Shivneri, to them in October 1636.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=22}} He directed Dadoji Kondadeo to bring Jijabai and Shivaji from Shivneri to Pune, and take care of their expenses.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shivaji spent his formative years at Pune.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}} Meanwhile, Shahaji departed for south, and did not see Shivaji for several years. In absence of his father, Shivaji grew very close to his mother.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Neglected by her husband, Jijabai led a deeply religious - almost ascetic - life, and this religious environment had a profound influence on Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=21, 29}}\n\nShahaji's land grant in the [[Pune district|Pune]] region included the ''[[patil (title)|patil]]'' (village chief) rights to three villages, the ''[[deshmukh]]'' rights of [[Indapur]], and the ''[[jagir|mokasa]]'' (revenue collection in exchange for military service) rights of Pune region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|pp=59-60}} The ''mokasa'' land granted to Shahaji was a triangular region bounded by the [[Western Ghats]] in the west, the [[Bhima River]] in the north-east, and the [[Nira River]] in the south.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} This region had been devastated by constant warfare between Shahaji, Bijapur, and the Mughals in the 1630s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=23-24}} Dadoji tried to increase the regional revenue yield by offering cheap land leases and rewards to kill wolves, so that more land could be brought under agricultural use.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=24}} He organized a group of local soldiers to maintan law and order.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Dadoji took possession of lands controlled by twelve ''deshmukhs'' of the [[Maval|Mawal]] region, and had those who resisted killed.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', Shivaji captured and killed Krishnaji Nayak Bandal, a ''deshmukh'' of Hirdas Maval area whom Dadoji had failed to subjugate. Historian Jadunath Sarkar believes this to be incorrect, and states that it was Dadoji who completed the subjugatation of the Maval ''deshmukhs''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}}\n\n== Education and training ==\n\nShivaji's early training probably included what was expected of the son of a ''[[jagirdar]]'': some reading and writing, horse-riding, martial arts, and religious practice.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} According to ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Dadoji personally trained Shivaji, and also appointed a good teacher for him.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} As a result, Shivaji became skilled in \"fighting, riding, and other accomplishments\".{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' does not mention anything about Shivaji being taught to read and write. The ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' (c. 1811) states that Shivaji had become \"very learned\" by the age of 10 years. ''Shiva-digivjaya'' claims that he mastered several arts and sciences as a boy.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}} Historian Jadunath Sarkar notes that several Europeans visited Shivaji's court, and their accounts do not mention any reading or writing by Shivaji. Whenever these Europeans presented any letter to Shivaji, he would pass it on to his ministers for reading. Therefore, Sarkar concludes that Shivaji was illiterate like many other rulers of medieval India, such as [[Akbar]], [[Hyder Ali]], and [[Ranjit Singh]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\nWhether or not Shivaji was literate, he listened to the recitations of the Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The political and moral lessions from these epics greatly impressed his young mind. He was deeply interested in religious teachings, and sought the society of Hindu and Muslim saints wherever he went.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n== Alienation from father ==\n\nEven when Shahaji was in northern Deccan, Shivaji and his mother Jijabai rarely saw him, because of Shahaji's military preoccupations.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After Shahaji was deputed in the south, the father and son did not see each other for several years.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shahaji became Bijapur's governor of [[Bangalore]] in the south, and married another woman - Tukabai.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} Shivaji's elder brother Sambhaji moved to Bangalore,{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} but Shivaji and Jijabai were called to Bangalore only in 1640. Meanwhile, Shivaji married [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]], a member of the prominent Nimbalkar Maratha family. In 1642, Shivaji and his mother returned to Pune, after a formal presentation at the Bijapur court.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to a doubtful narrative in ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Shahaji had developed a deep dislike for Jijabai's father Lakhuji Jadhav. After the death of his eldest son Sambhaji (or Shambhuji) at Kanakagiri in 1654, he declared that Shivaji - his surviving son from Lakhuji's daughter - would be no good.

During this time, the administration was largely handled by his queen, titled ''Bari Sahiba''. Taking advantage of the instability, Shivaji captured several forts in the Bijapur territory.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nBy the time he was 15 years old, Shivaji called himself a \"king\" (''raja'').

According to Khafi Khan's ''[[Muntakhab-al Lubab]]'', Shivaji bribed some court ministers to get these complaints dismissed. According to the ''Chitnis Bakhar'', Shahaji assured the king of Shivaji's loyalty, and justified Shivaji's control of Torna fort by arguing that the earlier administrator of the fort was negligient. Meanwhile, in secretly reprimanded Shivaji in a letter, and ordered Dadoji to keep him under control.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}}\n\n== After Dadoji ==\n\nDadoji advised Shivaji to rise in rank and wealth an obedient vassal of the Deccan Sultanates, but Shivaji wanted to act independently. Dadoji was greatly concerned about Shivaji's associations with hill brigands and his plans to rob forts. Dadoji complained to Shahaji, but did not succeed in changing Shivaji's behavior.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} The ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' states that Dadoji committed suicide by poison, because he was disgusted with Shivaji's waywardness.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n\nShivaji probably participated in Dadoji Kondadeo's administration of Shahji's Pune ''[[jagir]]''.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} During his last years, Dadoji had started issuing administrative orders in Shivaji's name.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}} When Dadoji died in 1647, Shivaji assumed the full control of his father's ''jagir''.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nHis officers included:\n\n* Appointed by Shahaji around 1639:\n** Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar (or Rozekar), ''peshwa'' (Chancellor){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Balkrishna Dikshit, ''majumdar'' (Accountant-General){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Somaji Pant, ''dabir'' (Secretary){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Raghunath Ballal Korde, ''sabnis'' (Paymaster){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n* Appointed by Shivaji\n** Tukoji Chor Maratha, ''sar-i-naubat'' (Commander-in-Chief){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Narayan Pant, divisional paymaster{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\n=== Consolidation of control around Pune ===\n\nAfter Dadoji's death, Shivaji started consolidating his control over Shahaji's ''jagir'' around the Pune region. Dadoji had assigned the administration of the Supe ''mahal'' (subdivision) to Shambhuji (or Sambhaji) Mohite, the brother of Shahaji's second wife Tukabai. After Dadoji's death, Shambhuji refused to take orders from Shivaji, declaring that he would report directly to Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Shivaji visited Shambhuji during the [[Holi|Shimga]] festival on the pretext of asking for a post, and imprisoned him. Shivaji confiscated all his property, including 300 horses, personal belongings including clothes, and other wealth.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} When Sambhaji still refused recognize Shivaji's authority, Shivaji forcibly annexed Supe and sent Shambhuji to Shahaji with his personal property.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=33-34}}\n\nShortly after the annexation of Supe, Shivaji raided [[Junnar]], where he captured 300 horses, goods worth 300 ''hons'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), clothes, and jewels.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n[[Firangoji Narsala]], who had been appointed as the administrator of the [[Chakan Fort]], accepted Shivaji's authority.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} The commanders of [[Baramati]] and [[Indapur]] also recognized his authority.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nThe ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'' states that Shivaji took control of the [[Kondana]] Fort by bribing its Bijapuri governor.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nThe Purandar Fort of Bijapur Sultante was administered by Nilo Nilkanth Nayak, a Brahmin whose family had controlled the fort and its surrounding area for several years. His younger brothers Pilaji and Shankaraji resented being excluded from their hereditary rights to the fort, and requested Shivaji to arbitrate. Shivaji entered the fort as a guest during the [[Diwali]] celebrations, and three days later, the younger brothers imprisoned Nilo and brought him before Shivaji. Shivaji imprisoned all three brothers, and took control of the fort himself.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' and ''[[Shiva Digvijaya]]'', he later granted estates at other places to the younger brothers as compensation.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=34-35}} He expelled Nilo Nayak's subordinates from the fort, and replaced them with his own men.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nSubsequently, Shivaji also acquired control of several other forts around Pune, including [[Rohida fort|Rohira]], [[Tikona]], [[Rajmachi]], and [[Lohagad]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}}\n\n=== In Konkan ===\n\nAfter consolidating his control over Pune, Shivaji crossed the [[Western Ghats]], and entered the [[Konkan]] region on the western coast of India. The [[Kalyan]] ''jagir'' in this region was under the control of by Mulla Ahmad, a [[Nawaiyat]] Muslim of [[Arabs|Arab]] origin. The region had been recently acquired by the Bijapur Sultanate after the decline of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]], and Mulla Ahmad - who was considered a foreigner by the locals - remained away at [[Bijapur]]. Because of this, the administration of the ''jagir'' had become inefficient.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}} Shivaji sent a cavalry led by Abaji Sondev to conquer the Kalyan ''jagir''. The cavalry plundered much wealth and merchandise from the non-fortified towns of Kalyan and [[Bhiwandi]], and captured the [[Mahuli]] fort which was once under the control of Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}}\n\nOver the next year (1648), Shivaji consolidated his control in northern Konkan, establishing authority over local chiefs and capturing territories from the [[Siddi]]s of [[Janjira State|Janjira]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} The Siddis had become practically independent after the fall of their former overlords - the kings of [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], although they recognized the nominal suzerainty of Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=293-294}} From Kalyan, Shivaji moved southwards towards [[Kolaba Fort|Kolaba]]: several local Hindu chiefs invited him to their territories. He captured [[Surgad]], [[Birwadi]], [[Tala, Raigad|Tala]], [[Ghosale gad|Ghosalegad]], [[Sudhagad]], [[Kangori]], and [[Raigad Fort|Rairi]] (Raigad, his future capital). He built new forts at [[Birwadi fort|Birwadi]] and [[Lingana]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} Shivaji appointed Abaji Sondev as the viceroy of this newly-conquered territory in northern Konkan.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nSometime in 1648, the Siddis inflicted a crushing defeat on Shivaji's forces led by the ''[[Peshwa]]'' Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar. According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', a displeased Shivaji removed Ranjhekar from his post, and appointed [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] as the new Peshwa. He also sent a large army led by Raghunath Ballal Korde against the Siddis.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nIn late 1648, the Bijapuri government imprisoned Shivaji's father Shahaji.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-39}} According to Zahur's ''Muhammad-namah'' (the official court history of Bijapur) and ''Basatin-i-Salatin'' (a later history), Shahaji was arrested for insubordination during the siege of [[Gingee Fort|Jinji]] against the [[Golconda Sultanate]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=38-39}} However, ''Chitnis Bakhar'', a Maratha chronicle written over 150 years after the event, states that Shahaji was arrested because the Bijapuri court suspected him to be involved in the rebellious activities of his son Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-38}}\n\nWhile his father was imprisoned at Bijapur, Bijapuri government sent an army to recapture Purandar from Shivaji, but this force was unable to dislodge Shivaji from the fort.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=62}} Meanwhile, Shivaji unsuccessfully attempted to forge an alliance with the Mughals against Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lal Mahal]], the residential palace where Shivaji stayed during his early life\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite book |author=A.

It is a [[remake]] of the 1933 [[King Kong (1933 film)|film of the same name]] about a giant [[ape]] that is captured and taken to New York City for exhibition. Featuring [[special effects]] by [[Carlo Rambaldi]], it stars [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Jessica Lange]] in her first film role.\n\nThe idea to remake ''King Kong'' was conceived by [[Michael Eisner]], who was then an ABC executive, in 1974. He separately proposed the idea to [[Universal Pictures]] CEO [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and Paramount Pictures CEO [[Barry Diller]]. Dino De Laurentiis quickly acquired the film rights from [[RKO-General]] and subsequently hired television writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] to write the script. John Guillermin was hired as director and filming lasted from January to August 1976. Before the film's release, Universal Pictures sued De Laurentiis and RKO-General alleging a breach of contract and attempted to develop their own remake of ''King Kong''. In response, De Laurentiis and RKO-General filed separate countersuits against Universal Pictures, all of which were withdrawn by January 1976. \n\nThe film was released on December 17, 1976 to mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. Of the three ''King Kong'' main films, it is the only one to feature the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] instead of the [[Empire State Building]]. A sequel titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' was released in 1986.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nFred Wilson, an executive of the Petrox Oil Company, forms an expedition based on infrared imagery which reveals a previously undiscovered [[Indian Ocean]] island hidden by a permanent cloud bank. Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott, a primate [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the ''Petrox Explorer''. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a spy from a rival oil company. \n\nWhile being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying a young woman who is unconscious. After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when the woman revives. When she does regain consciousness, she says her name is Dwan, and states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded.\n\nWhen the ''Petrox Explorer'' arrives at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] who live within the confines of a gigantic wall. The tribal chief shows an immediate interest in the blonde Dwan, offering to trade several of the native women for her, an offer firmly rejected by Jack. The team then learn that while the island does indeed contain large deposits of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. Later that night, the natives secretly board the ship and kidnap Dwan, drugging her and offering her as a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to a giant, monstrous ape known as [[King Kong|Kong]]. Kong encounters and frees Dwan from the stronghold before retreating into the depths of the island. Although he is an awesome and terrifying sight, the kind-hearted Kong quickly becomes infatuated by Dwan, whose rambling monologue both calms and fascinates the great ape, taming his baser, more violent instincts. After Dwan falls into mud, Kong takes her to a waterfall to wash her up and dries her with great gusts of his warm breath.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack and First Mate Carnahan lead several crew members on a rescue mission to save Dwan. The search party soon encounter Kong while crossing a log bridge. Enraged by the intrusion into his territory, Kong starts to roll the huge log, sending Carnahan and all but one of the team plummeting to their deaths, leaving Jack and Crewman Boan as the only surviving ones alive. While Boan returns to the village to alert the others at Jack's insistence, Jack decides to keep looking for Dwan. Meanwhile, Kong takes Dwan to his lair, but as he starts to undress her, a giant [[boa constrictor]] appears and attacks them. While Kong is distracted fighting the giant snake as it coils itself around him, Jack arrives and rescues Dwan. When Kong discovers Jack and Dwan escaping, he violently kills the snake and chases them through the jungle back to the native village. Smashing down the huge gates, Kong falls into a [[Trapping pit|pit trap]] that Wilson and the crew have dug, where he is overwhelmed by [[chloroform]].\n\nAfter learning that the oil cannot be refined, Wilson has instead decided to salvage the expedition by transporting the captive Kong to America as a promotional gimmick for Petrox. Kong is then loaded in the cargo hold, where he is later fed with tons of fruit. Although Dwan and Jack are upset at Kong's treatment, the great ape starts to grow increasingly distressed throughout the journey. One night, Dwan accidentally falls into the cargo hold, only for Kong to catch her. After Dwan is rescued, the captain of the ''Petrox Explorer'' orders the hold to be flooded, but Kong becomes calm and allows Dwan to climb back out. When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display, bound in chains with a large cage around his body from the neck down and a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters pushing and shoving Dwan for interviews, the ape, thinking that she is being provoked, breaks free of his bonds. A stampede ensues as panic engulfs the throng, with people crushed and trampled by Kong's massive feet as he walks through the crowd searching for Dwan. Wilson, trying to flee, loses his footing and is crushed underfoot by Kong.\n\nJack and Dwan flee across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] to [[Manhattan]] and take refuge in an abandoned bar, where Jack notices a similarity between the Manhattan skyline (notably the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers of the World Trade Center]]) and the mountainous terrain of Kong's island. He runs downstairs to call the mayor's office and agrees to tell them on the condition that Kong is captured alive. When the mayor's office agrees, Jack tells them to let Kong climb to the top of the World Trade Center, where he can be safely captured. Before Jack can return, Kong, using his enhanced senses, discovers Dwan and snatches her from the bar before making his way to the World Trade Center with Jack and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] catching up in pursuit.\n\nKong climbs to the roof of the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] of the World Trade Center, where he is attacked by soldiers armed with [[flamethrower]]s, much to Jack's dismay. Kong manages to evade them with a spectacular leap across to the roof of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. He rips off pieces of equipment from the roof and throws them at the soldiers, killing them when he throws a tank of flammable material. After ensuring Dwan's safety, Kong is attacked by helicopters with [[machine gun]]s, but destroys one of them. Dwan desperately pleads for the military to break off their assault and let Kong live, but the pilots only continue to attack the giant ape. Eventually, the relentless shower of bullets finally brings down Kong. As Dwan approaches the wounded Kong and puts out her hand to touch him, he rolls over the edge of the roof to his death, finally crashing to the plaza hundreds of feet below. \n\nDwan rushes down to comfort Kong and tearfully watches him as the giant ape takes his last breath and dies peacefully. An enormous crowd gathers around Dwan and Kong's corpse while Jack fights his way through the crowd to get to Dwan. However, he is stopped short by police as she is surrounded by journalists and paparazzi, despite her cries to him though they were married soon after this and they happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Prescott\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Dwan\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Fred S.

In December 1974, [[Michael Eisner]], then an executive for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], watched the original film on television and struck on the idea for a remake. He pitched the idea to [[Barry Diller]], the chairman and CEO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who then enlisted veteran producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] to work on the project. However, De Laurentiis claimed the idea to remake ''King Kong'' was solely his own when he saw a ''Kong'' poster in his daughter's bedroom as he woke her up every morning. When Diller suggested doing a monster film with him, De Laurentiis proposed the idea to remake ''King Kong''.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\">{{cite magazine|last=Tobias|first=Andrew|title=The Battle for King Kong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q=the%20battle%20for%20king%20kong%20new%20york%20magazine|pages=38\u201344|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 23, 1976|accessdate=July 30, 2018|volume=9|issue=8|issn=0028-7369|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Diller and De Laurentiis provisionally agreed that Paramount would pay half of the film's proposed $12 million budget in return for the distribution rights in the United States and Canada if the former could purchase the film rights of the original film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}}\n\nDe Laurentiis later contacted his friend [[Thomas F.

Impressed with his work on the film, De Laurentiis contacted Semple about writing ''King Kong'', in which Semple immediately signed on. During their collaboration on the project, De Laurentiis already had two ideas in mind\u2014that the film would set in present day and the climax would set on top of the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=152}}\n\nBecause of the risen sophistication in audiences' tastes since the original film, Semple sought to maintain a realistic tone, but infuse the script with a sly, ironic sense of humor that the audiences could laugh at. Having settled on the mood, Semple retained the basic plotline and set pieces from the original film, but updated and reworked other elements of the story. Inspired by the [[1970s energy crisis|then-ongoing energy crisis]] and a suggestion from his friend Jerry Brick, Semple changed the expedition to being mounted by Petrox Corporation, a giant petroleum conglomerate whom suspected that Kong's island has unrefined oil reserves. In its original story outline, Petrox would discover Kong's island from a map hidden in the secret archives at the [[Vatican Library]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nIn a notable departure from the original film, Semple dropped the dinosaurs that are present with Kong on the island. The reasons for the dropped subplot was due to the increased attention on Kong and Dwan's love story and financial reasons as De Laurentiis did not want to use [[stop-motion animation]] in the film. Nevertheless, a giant [[boa constrictor]] was incorporated into the film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nA fast writer, Semple completed a forty-page outline within a few days and delivered it in August 1975. While De Laurentiis was pleased with Semple's outline, he expressed displeasure with the Vatican Library subplot, which was immediately dropped. It would later be replaced with Petrox discovering the island through obtained classified photos taken by a United States [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Within a month, the 140-page first draft incorporated the character of Dwan (who according to the script was originally named Dawn until she switched the two middle letters to make it more memorable), the updated rendition of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. For its second draft, the script was reduced to 110 pages.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=155\u20136}} The final draft was completed by December 1975.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=160}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Meryl Streep]] has said that she was considered for the role of Dwan, but was deemed too unattractive by producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Graham Norton Show|series-link=The Graham Norton Show  |network= [[BBC]]|series-no=16|number=13|title=Meryl Streep's worst audition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWF20AfNS4|date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Dwan was also proposed to [[Barbra Streisand]] but she turned it down.<ref>Medved, Michael, and Harry Medved.

De Laurentiis's next choice was director [[John Guillermin]] who had just finished directing ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Guillermin, who was known to have had outbursts from time to time on the set, got into a public shouting match with executive producer Federico De Laurentiis (son of producer Dino De Laurentiis). After the incident, De Laurentiis was reported to have threatened to fire Guillermin if he did not start treating the cast and crew better.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=93}} [[Rick Baker]], who designed and wore the [[ape suit]] in collaboration with [[Carlo Rambaldi]], was extremely disappointed in the final suit, which he felt was not at all convincing.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=209}} He gives all the credit for its passable appearance to cinematographer [[Richard H. Kline]]. The only time that the collaboration of Baker and Rambaldi went smoothly was during the design of the mechanical Kong mask. Baker's design and Rambaldi's cable work combined to give Kong's face a wide range of expression that was responsible for much of the film's emotional impact. Baker gave much of the credit for its effectiveness to Rambaldi and his mechanics.\n\nTo film the scene where the ''Petrox Explorer'' finds Dwan in the life raft, Jessica Lange spent hours in a rubber raft in the freezing cold, drenched and wearing only a slinky black dress. Although Lange was not aware of it, there were [[shark]]s circling the raft the entire time. Shooting of this scene took place in the channel between Los Angeles and Catalina Island during the last week in January 1976.\n\nOn one of the nights of filming Kong's death at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], over 30,000 people showed up at the site to be [[extra (actor)|extra]]s for the scene. Although the crowd was well behaved, the [[Port Authority of New York & New Jersey]] (owner of the World Trade Center complex) became concerned that the weight of so many people would cause the plaza to collapse, and ordered the producers to shut down the filming.  However, the film makers had already got the shot they wanted of the large crowd rushing toward Kong's body. They returned to the site days later to finish filming the scene, with a much smaller crowd of paid extras.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|pp=218\u201328}}\n\nAccording to Bahrenburg, five different masks were created by Carlo Rambaldi to convey various emotions.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|p=177}} Separate masks were necessary as there were too many cables and mechanics required for all the expressions to fit in one single mask.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|pp=176\u201377}} To complete the look of a gorilla, Baker wore contact lenses so his eyes would resemble those of a gorilla.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|p=177}}\n\nRambaldi's mechanical Kong was 40&nbsp;ft (12.2 m) tall and weighed 6{{sfrac|1|2}} tons.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|p=204}} It cost \u00a3500,000 to create.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jul/13/observer-archive-king-kong-expensive-remake|title=From the Observer archive 11 July 1976: King Kong dogged by costly mishaps|last=Foley|first=Charles|date=July 12, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Despite months of preparation, the final device proved to be impossible to operate convincingly, and is only seen in a series of brief shots totaling less than 15 seconds.\n\nThe roar used for Kong was taken from the film ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960).\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].

Shortly after, Universal decided to purchase the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, [[Sensurround]], which debuted with the [[disaster film]] ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', for Kong's roars. On April 5, 1975, Daniel O'Shea, a semi-attorney for RKO-General, had arranged meetings with Arnold Stane, attorney for MCA/Universal, and De Laurentiis and Sidewater for the film rights to ''King Kong''; neither side knew that a rival studio were in negotiation. With a bargain price set $150,000, Stane had negotiated an offer of $200,000 plus 5 percent of the film's net profit. In contrast, De Laurentiis had offered $200,000 plus 3 percent of the film's gross\u2014and 10 percent if the film recouped two and a half its negative cost. In May 1975, the film rights were granted to De Laurentiis.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nIn the wake of the agreement, Shane claimed that O'Shea had verbally accepted Universal's offer although no official paperwork was signed. O'Shea contested, \"I did not make any agreement written or oral ... never told him we had an agreement, nor words to that effect ... never told him that I had the authority ... I am not an employee, agent, or officer at RKO.\"<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" /> A few days later, Universal filed suit against De Laurentiis and RKO-General in [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] for $25 million on charges of breach of contract, fraud, and intentional interference with advantageous business relations. In October 1975, Universal, which was in pre-production with their own remake with [[Hunt Stromberg, Jr.]], as producer and [[Joseph Sargent]] as director, filed suit in a federal district court arguing that the story's \"basic ingredients\" were [[public domain]].<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\" /> Universal had claimed that their remake was based on the two-part serialization by [[Edgar Wallace]] and a novelization by [[Delos W. Lovelace]] adapted from the screenplay that had been published shortly before the film's release in 1933.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nOn November 12, 1975, Universal announced it would start production on ''The Legend of King Kong'' on January 5, 1976 with [[Bo Goldman]] writing the screenplay based on the novelization by Lovelace.<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Mary|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/166074278/|title=Anjelica's Visage Wins Role|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=Part IV, p. 11|url-access=subscription|via=Newspapers.com|date=November 12, 1975|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref> On November 20, RKO-General countersued Universal for $5 million alleging that ''The Legend of King Kong'' was an infringement on their copyright, and asked the court to prevent any \"announcements, representations, and statements\" on their proposed film.

When ''King Kong'' made its television debut over two nights in October 1978, around 45 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make the film longer, and it had some added or replaced music cues. Additionally, in order to obtain a lower, [[family-friendly]] TV rating, overtly violent or sexual scenes in the theatrical version were trimmed down or replaced with less explicit takes, and all swearing or potentially offensive language was removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=520761|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=934778|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison #2|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref> Further extended broadcasts followed in November 1980 and March 1983.\n\n===Home video===\nThe theatrical version of the film has been released numerous times worldwide on all known home video formats.

It is a [[remake]] of the 1933 [[King Kong (1933 film)|film of the same name]] about a giant [[ape]] that is captured and taken to New York City for exhibition. Featuring [[special effects]] by [[Carlo Rambaldi]], it stars [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Jessica Lange]] in her first film role.\n\nThe idea to remake ''King Kong'' was conceived by [[Michael Eisner]], who was then an ABC executive, in 1974. He separately proposed the idea to [[Universal Pictures]] CEO [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and Paramount Pictures CEO [[Barry Diller]]. Dino De Laurentiis quickly acquired the film rights from [[RKO-General]] and subsequently hired television writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] to write the script. John Guillermin was hired as director and filming lasted from January to August 1976. Before the film's release, Universal Pictures sued De Laurentiis and RKO-General alleging a breach of contract and attempted to develop their own remake of ''King Kong''. In response, De Laurentiis and RKO-General filed separate countersuits against Universal Pictures, all of which were withdrawn by January 1976. \n\nThe film was released on December 17, 1976 to mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. Of the three ''King Kong'' main films, it is the only one to feature the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] instead of the [[Empire State Building]]. A sequel titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' was released in 1986.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nFred Wilson, an executive of the Petrox Oil Company, forms an expedition based on infrared imagery which reveals a previously undiscovered [[Indian Ocean]] island hidden by a permanent cloud bank. Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott, a primate [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the ''Petrox Explorer''. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a spy from a rival oil company. \n\nWhile being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying a young woman who is unconscious. After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when the woman revives. When she does regain consciousness, she says her name is Dwan, and states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded.\n\nWhen the ''Petrox Explorer'' arrives at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] who live within the confines of a gigantic wall. The tribal chief shows an immediate interest in the blonde Dwan, offering to trade several of the native women for her, an offer firmly rejected by Jack. The team then learn that while the island does indeed contain large deposits of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. Later that night, the natives secretly board the ship and kidnap Dwan, drugging her and offering her as a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to a giant, monstrous ape known as [[King Kong|Kong]]. Kong encounters and frees Dwan from the stronghold before retreating into the depths of the island. Although he is an awesome and terrifying sight, the kind-hearted Kong quickly becomes infatuated by Dwan, whose rambling monologue both calms and fascinates the great ape, taming his baser, more violent instincts. After Dwan falls into mud, Kong takes her to a waterfall to wash her up and dries her with great gusts of his warm breath.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack and First Mate Carnahan lead several crew members on a rescue mission to save Dwan. The search party soon encounter Kong while crossing a log bridge. Enraged by the intrusion into his territory, Kong starts to roll the huge log, sending Carnahan and all but one of the team plummeting to their deaths, leaving Jack and Crewman Boan as the only surviving ones alive. While Boan returns to the village to alert the others at Jack's insistence, Jack decides to keep looking for Dwan. Meanwhile, Kong takes Dwan to his lair, but as he starts to undress her, a giant [[boa constrictor]] appears and attacks them. While Kong is distracted fighting the giant snake as it coils itself around him, Jack arrives and rescues Dwan. When Kong discovers Jack and Dwan escaping, he violently kills the snake and chases them through the jungle back to the native village. Smashing down the huge gates, Kong falls into a [[Trapping pit|pit trap]] that Wilson and the crew have dug, where he is overwhelmed by [[chloroform]].\n\nAfter learning that the oil cannot be refined, Wilson has instead decided to salvage the expedition by transporting the captive Kong to America as a promotional gimmick for Petrox. Kong is then loaded in the cargo hold, where he is later fed with tons of fruit. Although Dwan and Jack are upset at Kong's treatment, the great ape starts to grow increasingly distressed throughout the journey. One night, Dwan accidentally falls into the cargo hold, only for Kong to catch her. After Dwan is rescued, the captain of the ''Petrox Explorer'' orders the hold to be flooded, but Kong becomes calm and allows Dwan to climb back out. When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display, bound in chains with a large cage around his body from the neck down and a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters pushing and shoving Dwan for interviews, the ape, thinking that she is being provoked, breaks free of his bonds. A stampede ensues as panic engulfs the throng, with people crushed and trampled by Kong's massive feet as he walks through the crowd searching for Dwan. Wilson, trying to flee, loses his footing and is crushed underfoot by Kong.\n\nJack and Dwan flee across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] to [[Manhattan]] and take refuge in an abandoned bar, where Jack notices a similarity between the Manhattan skyline (notably the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers of the World Trade Center]]) and the mountainous terrain of Kong's island. He runs downstairs to call the mayor's office and agrees to tell them on the condition that Kong is captured alive. When the mayor's office agrees, Jack tells them to let Kong climb to the top of the World Trade Center, where he can be safely captured. Before Jack can return, Kong, using his enhanced senses, discovers Dwan and snatches her from the bar before making his way to the World Trade Center with Jack and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] catching up in pursuit.\n\nKong climbs to the roof of the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] of the World Trade Center, where he is attacked by soldiers armed with [[flamethrower]]s, much to Jack's dismay. Kong manages to evade them with a spectacular leap across to the roof of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. He rips off pieces of equipment from the roof and throws them at the soldiers, killing them when he throws a tank of flammable material. After ensuring Dwan's safety, Kong is attacked by helicopters with [[machine gun]]s, but destroys one of them. Dwan desperately pleads for the military to break off their assault and let Kong live, but the pilots only continue to attack the giant ape. Eventually, the relentless shower of bullets finally brings down Kong. As Dwan approaches the wounded Kong and puts out her hand to touch him, he rolls over the edge of the roof to his death, finally crashing to the plaza hundreds of feet below. \n\nDwan rushes down to comfort Kong and tearfully watches him as the giant ape takes his last breath and dies peacefully. An enormous crowd gathers around Dwan and Kong's corpse while Jack fights his way through the crowd to get to Dwan. However, he is stopped short by police as she is surrounded by journalists and paparazzi, despite her cries to him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Prescott\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Dwan\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Fred S.

In December 1974, [[Michael Eisner]], then an executive for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], watched the original film on television and struck on the idea for a remake. He pitched the idea to [[Barry Diller]], the chairman and CEO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who then enlisted veteran producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] to work on the project. However, De Laurentiis claimed the idea to remake ''King Kong'' was solely his own when he saw a ''Kong'' poster in his daughter's bedroom as he woke her up every morning. When Diller suggested doing a monster film with him, De Laurentiis proposed the idea to remake ''King Kong''.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\">{{cite magazine|last=Tobias|first=Andrew|title=The Battle for King Kong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q=the%20battle%20for%20king%20kong%20new%20york%20magazine|pages=38\u201344|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 23, 1976|accessdate=July 30, 2018|volume=9|issue=8|issn=0028-7369|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Diller and De Laurentiis provisionally agreed that Paramount would pay half of the film's proposed $12 million budget in return for the distribution rights in the United States and Canada if the former could purchase the film rights of the original film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}}\n\nDe Laurentiis later contacted his friend [[Thomas F.

Later, De Laurentiis and company executive Frederic Sidewater entered formal negotiations with Daniel O'Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, who requested a percentage of the film's gross.

Impressed with his work on the film, De Laurentiis contacted Semple about writing ''King Kong'', in which Semple immediately signed on. During their collaboration on the project, De Laurentiis already had two ideas in mind\u2014that the film would set in present day and the climax would set on top of the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=152}}\n\nBecause of the risen sophistication in audiences' tastes since the original film, Semple sought to maintain a realistic tone, but infuse the script with a sly, ironic sense of humor that the audiences could laugh at. Having settled on the mood, Semple retained the basic plotline and set pieces from the original film, but updated and reworked other elements of the story. Inspired by the [[1970s energy crisis|then-ongoing energy crisis]] and a suggestion from his friend Jerry Brick, Semple changed the expedition to being mounted by Petrox Corporation, a giant petroleum conglomerate whom suspected that Kong's island has unrefined oil reserves. In its original story outline, Petrox would discover Kong's island from a map hidden in the secret archives at the [[Vatican Library]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nIn a notable departure from the original film, Semple dropped the dinosaurs that are present with Kong on the island. The reasons for the dropped subplot was due to the increased attention on Kong and Dwan's love story and financial reasons as De Laurentiis did not want to use [[stop-motion animation]] in the film. Nevertheless, a giant [[boa constrictor]] was incorporated into the film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nA fast writer, Semple completed a forty-page outline within a few days and delivered it in August 1975. While De Laurentiis was pleased with Semple's outline, he expressed displeasure with the Vatican Library subplot, which was immediately dropped. It would later be replaced with Petrox discovering the island through obtained classified photos taken by a United States [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Within a month, the 140-page first draft incorporated the character of Dwan (who according to the script was originally named Dawn until she switched the two middle letters to make it more memorable), the updated rendition of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. For its second draft, the script was reduced to 110 pages.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=155\u20136}} The final draft was completed by December 1975.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=160}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Meryl Streep]] has said that she was considered for the role of Dwan, but was deemed too unattractive by producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Graham Norton Show|series-link=The Graham Norton Show  |network= [[BBC]]|series-no=16|number=13|title=Meryl Streep's worst audition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWF20AfNS4|date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Dwan was also proposed to [[Barbra Streisand]] but she turned it down.<ref>Medved, Michael, and Harry Medved.

De Laurentiis's next choice was director [[John Guillermin]] who had just finished directing ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Guillermin, who was known to have had outbursts from time to time on the set, got into a public shouting match with executive producer Federico De Laurentiis (son of producer Dino De Laurentiis). After the incident, De Laurentiis was reported to have threatened to fire Guillermin if he did not start treating the cast and crew better.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=93}} [[Rick Baker]], who designed and wore the [[ape suit]] in collaboration with [[Carlo Rambaldi]], was extremely disappointed in the final suit, which he felt was not at all convincing.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=209}} He gives all the credit for its passable appearance to cinematographer [[Richard H. Kline]]. The only time that the collaboration of Baker and Rambaldi went smoothly was during the design of the mechanical Kong mask. Baker's design and Rambaldi's cable work combined to give Kong's face a wide range of expression that was responsible for much of the film's emotional impact. Baker gave much of the credit for its effectiveness to Rambaldi and his mechanics.\n\nTo film the scene where the ''Petrox Explorer'' finds Dwan in the life raft, Jessica Lange spent hours in a rubber raft in the freezing cold, drenched and wearing only a slinky black dress. Although Lange was not aware of it, there were [[shark]]s circling the raft the entire time. Shooting of this scene took place in the channel between Los Angeles and Catalina Island during the last week in January 1976.\n\nOn one of the nights of filming Kong's death at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], over 30,000 people showed up at the site to be [[extra (actor)|extra]]s for the scene. Although the crowd was well behaved, the [[Port Authority of New York & New Jersey]] (owner of the World Trade Center complex) became concerned that the weight of so many people would cause the plaza to collapse, and ordered the producers to shut down the filming.  However, the film makers had already got the shot they wanted of the large crowd rushing toward Kong's body.

Shortly after, Universal decided to purchase the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, [[Sensurround]], which debuted with the [[disaster film]] ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', for Kong's roars. On April 5, 1975, Daniel O'Shea, a semi-attorney for RKO-General, had arranged meetings with Arnold Stane, attorney for MCA/Universal, and De Laurentiis and Sidewater for the film rights to ''King Kong''; neither side knew that a rival studio were in negotiation. With a bargain price set $150,000, Stane had negotiated an offer of $200,000 plus 5 percent of the film's net profit. In contrast, De Laurentiis had offered $200,000 plus 3 percent of the film's gross\u2014and 10 percent if the film recouped two and a half its negative cost. In May 1975, the film rights were granted to De Laurentiis.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nIn the wake of the agreement, Shane claimed that O'Shea had verbally accepted Universal's offer although no official paperwork was signed. O'Shea contested, \"I did not make any agreement written or oral ... never told him we had an agreement, nor words to that effect ... never told him that I had the authority ... I am not an employee, agent, or officer at RKO.\"<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" /> A few days later, Universal filed suit against De Laurentiis and RKO-General in [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] for $25 million on charges of breach of contract, fraud, and intentional interference with advantageous business relations. In October 1975, Universal, which was in pre-production with their own remake with [[Hunt Stromberg, Jr.]], as producer and [[Joseph Sargent]] as director, filed suit in a federal district court arguing that the story's \"basic ingredients\" were [[public domain]].<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\" /> Universal had claimed that their remake was based on the two-part serialization by [[Edgar Wallace]] and a novelization by [[Delos W. Lovelace]] adapted from the screenplay that had been published shortly before the film's release in 1933.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nOn November 12, 1975, Universal announced it would start production on ''The Legend of King Kong'' on January 5, 1976 with [[Bo Goldman]] writing the screenplay based on the novelization by Lovelace.<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Mary|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/166074278/|title=Anjelica's Visage Wins Role|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=Part IV, p. 11|url-access=subscription|via=Newspapers.com|date=November 12, 1975|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref> On November 20, RKO-General countersued Universal for $5 million alleging that ''The Legend of King Kong'' was an infringement on their copyright, and asked the court to prevent any \"announcements, representations, and statements\" on their proposed film. On December 4, De Laurentiis countersued for $90 million with charges of copyright infringement and \"unfair competition\".{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=162}} In January 1976, both studios agreed to withdraw their legal suits filed against each other. Universal agreed to cancel ''The Legend of King Kong'', but intended to proceed with a remake sometime in the future although on the condition to release it eighteen months after De Laurentiis's remake.<ref>{{cite news|title=Producers Settle Dispute on 'King Kong' Remakes|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/382977325/|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|via=Newspapers.com|url-access=subscription|date=January 30, 1976|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=166}} In September 1976, a federal judge ruled in favor of Universal that Lovelace's novelization had fallen into public domain which cleared the studio to produce a remake.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kong Goes Public|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/398658902/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Constitution]]|page=2\u2013B|date=September 16, 1976|accessdate=August 2, 2018|url-access=subscription|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Universal would later make its own remake, also titled ''[[King Kong (2005)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''King Kong'' was commercially successful, earning [[Paramount Pictures]] back over triple its budget.

However, it did obtain positive reviews from some prominent critics. [[Pauline Kael]] from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the film, noting \"The movie is a romantic adventure fantasy-colossal, silly, touching, a marvellous [''sic''] Classics Comics movie (and for the whole family). This new ''Kong'' doesn't have the magical primeval imagery of the first ''King Kong'', in 1933, and it doesn't have the [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] fable atmosphere, but it's a happier, livelier entertainment. The first ''Kong'' was a stunt film that was trying to awe you, and its lewd underlay had a carnival hucksterism that made you feel a little queasy.

When ''King Kong'' made its television debut over two nights in October 1978, around 45 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make the film longer, and it had some added or replaced music cues. Additionally, in order to obtain a lower, [[family-friendly]] TV rating, overtly violent or sexual scenes in the theatrical version were trimmed down or replaced with less explicit takes, and all swearing or potentially offensive language was removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=520761|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=934778|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison #2|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref> Further extended broadcasts followed in November 1980 and March 1983.\n\n===Home video===\nThe theatrical version of the film has been released numerous times worldwide on all known home video formats.

See talk page for discussion. -->\n\nThe '''bass guitar''', '''electric bass''', or simply '''bass''', is the lowest pitched member of the guitar family. It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]].

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.
