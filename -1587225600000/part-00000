{"title_page": "Hayce Lemsi", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=July 2017}}\n'''Islam Belouizdad''' (born in [[Hassi Messaoud]], Algeria on 16 December 1987) better known as '''Hayce Lemsi''' is an Algerian-French rapper and singer. He has also used the stage names ''L'insomniak'', ''La Kalash Humaine'', ''Big Lemsi'' and ''Biko Loco''. \n\nHe started his career in 2008 presenting his freestyle online and on radio. He released his debut mixtape ''Un petit pas pour Lemsi'' in 2012 followed by his breakout mixtape ''\u00c9lectron libre'' in 2013. In 2015 he released his debut studio album titled ''L'or des rois'' on [[Capitol Records]]. In 2017 he released his mixtape ''\u00c9lectron libre 2'' as a follow-up to ''\u00c9lectron libre''. He also has a joint album ''\u00c0 des ann\u00e9es lumi\u00e8res'' in collaboration with his biological brother Volts Face.\n\nIn 2015, he launches his own independent music label Triangle d'or, later renamed in Big Lemsi Record.\n\n==Biography==\nHayce Lemsi was born in [[Hassi Messaoud]], a town of 40,000 inhabitants located in the [[Algerian Sahara]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.booska-p.com/new-hayce-lemsi-le-succ-s-m-a-pete-la-gueule-n51080.html|title=Hayce Lemsi : \u00ab Le succ\u00e8s m'a p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la gueule... \u00bb|accessdate=1 September 2015|website=[[booska-p]]}}</ref>. His date of birth diverges according to the sources, most of them determining December 16, 1987. Then his family moved to the 17th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nHayce Lemsi is a big fan of [[Eminem]], whose career will inspire him to start his own. He starts his career in 2008 and started being recognised thanks to many freestyle from 2009. On 25 June 2012, he releases his first project, under the label Nord Island, a mixtape named ''Un petit pas pour Lemsi''. Then he was invited by [[Alkpote]] (French rapper) on the project ''Mazter Chefs Musik Vol. 1'', for the track ''Pas facile'' featuring Zekwe. On 4 November 2013, Hayce Lemsi releases his second project and mixtape, entitled ''\u00c9lectron libre'', with the participation of [[Soprano]] and [[Lacrim]], both French rappers. The project was ranked at number 10 on the French charts, and best sales of the week on the [[iTunes]] platform.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, he published ''Pyramide'' as the first extract of his first studio album, whose name is revealed in his 2015 medley, ''L\u2019or des rois''. Its release date is scheduled on 4 September 2015. On 13 May 2015, the second extract of the album, ''Faya'', is released. From Monday 31 August to Friday 4 September 2015 a special week is dedicated to him in the [[Plan\u00e8te Rap]] program on the French radio [[Skyrock (radio)|Skyrock]] for the upcoming release of his album. But on 2 September 2015 Hayce Lemsi was taken into custody. The album was released under his own label, created some time earlier, ''Triangle d\u2019or'', which signed bands and artists from his entourage, such as XV Barbar, and Hayce Lemsi\u2019s brother Volts Face, who is also featuring in his album for the track ''Walking dead''. [[Ma\u00eetre Gims]], a famous French rapper who released his second album a week earlier, is also invited on the album. In December 2015, he revealed his remix of the track ''Boxe avec les mots'', from [[\u00c4rsenik]].\n\nIn October 2015, Hayce Lemsi announced his departure from major [[Universal Music Group|Universal]], to return exclusively as an independent under his Triangle d'or label. In February 2016, he renamed his label ''Big Lemsi Records''. He announced for March 2016 the release of the album ''\u00c0 des ann\u00e9es lumi\u00e8res'', delayed for April 8 2016, an album in collaboration with his brother Volts Face, a French rapper.\n\nAt the end of 2016, Hayce Lemsi signed with the Eleven's Music label and the Pias record company in preparation of his new project ''\u00c9lectron libre 2'', which will be released a few months later, on 17 February 2017. This album includes many featurings with Jok'Air, Volts Face and the French singer Lise Auvolat. He played many concerts after the release of his album but was arrested on 28 April 2017, during the day of one of his concerts, when he was exiting a high-speed train (TGV). He is accused of not attending an interview with the sentencing judge who was handling his case. He was set free on 22 October 2017. On November 26, 2017, he released the video clip Dimanche Lokos, in which he announced the release date of his next mixtape, ''Eur\u00eaka'', which will be released on December 8, only on digital platforms.\n\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums and mixtapes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He has also used the stage names ''L'insomniak'', ''La Kalash Humaine'', ''Big Lemsi'' and ''Biko Loco''. \n\nHe started his career in 2008 presenting his freestyle online and on radio. He released his debut mixtape ''Un petit pas pour Lemsi'' in 2012 followed by his breakout mixtape ''\u00c9lectron libre'' in 2013. In 2015 he released his debut studio album titled ''L'or des rois'' on [[Capitol Records]]. In 2017 he released his mixtape ''\u00c9lectron libre 2'' as a follow-up to ''\u00c9lectron libre''. He also has a joint album ''\u00c0 des ann\u00e9es lumi\u00e8res'' in collaboration with his biological brother Volts Face.\n\nIn 2015, he launches his own independent music label Triangle d'or, later renamed in Big Lemsi Record.\n\n==Biography==\nHayce Lemsi was born in [[Hassi Messaoud]], a town of 40,000 inhabitants located in the [[Algerian Sahara]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.booska-p.com/new-hayce-lemsi-le-succ-s-m-a-pete-la-gueule-n51080.html|title=Hayce Lemsi : \u00ab Le succ\u00e8s m'a p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la gueule... \u00bb|accessdate=1 September 2015|website=[[booska-p]]}}</ref>. His date of birth diverges according to the sources, most of them determining December 16, 1987. Then his family moved to the 17th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nHayce Lemsi is a big fan of [[Eminem]], whose career will inspire him to start his own. He starts his career in 2008 and started being recognised thanks to many freestyle from 2009. On 25 June 2012, he releases his first project, under the label Nord Island, a mixtape named ''Un petit pas pour Lemsi''. Then he was invited by [[Alkpote]] (French rapper) on the project ''Mazter Chefs Musik Vol. 1'', for the track ''Pas facile'' featuring Zekwe. On 4 November 2013, Hayce Lemsi releases his second project and mixtape, entitled ''\u00c9lectron libre'', with the participation of [[Soprano]] and [[Lacrim]], both French rappers. The project was ranked at number 10 on the French charts, and best sales of the week on the [[iTunes]] platform.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, he published ''Pyramide'' as the first extract of his first studio album, whose name is revealed in his 2015 medley, ''L\u2019or des rois''. Its release date is scheduled on 4 September 2015. On 13 May 2015, the second extract of the album, ''Faya'', is released. From Monday 31 August to Friday 4 September 2015 a special week is dedicated to him in the [[Plan\u00e8te Rap]] program on the French radio [[Skyrock (radio)|Skyrock]] for the upcoming release of his album. But on 2 September 2015 Hayce Lemsi was taken into custody. The album was released under his own label, created some time earlier, ''Triangle d\u2019or'', which signed bands and artists from his entourage, such as XV Barbar, and Hayce Lemsi\u2019s brother Volts Face, who is also featuring in his album for the track ''Walking dead''. [[Ma\u00eetre Gims]], a famous French rapper who released his second album a week earlier, is also invited on the album. In December 2015, he revealed his remix of the track ''Boxe avec les mots'', from [[\u00c4rsenik]].\n\nIn October 2015, Hayce Lemsi announced his departure from major [[Universal Music Group|Universal]], to return exclusively as an independent under his Triangle d'or label. In February 2016, he renamed his label ''Big Lemsi Records''. He announced for March 2016 the release of the album ''\u00c0 des ann\u00e9es lumi\u00e8res'', delayed for April 8 2016, an album in collaboration with his brother Volts Face, a French rapper.\n\nAt the end of 2016, Hayce Lemsi signed with the Eleven's Music label and the Pias record company in preparation of his new project ''\u00c9lectron libre 2'', which will be released a few months later, on 17 February 2017. This album includes many featurings with Jok'Air, Volts Face and the French singer Lise Auvolat. He played many concerts after the release of his album but was arrested on 28 April 2017, during the day of one of his concerts, when he was exiting a high-speed train (TGV). He is accused of not attending an interview with the sentencing judge who was handling his case. He was set free on 22 October 2017. On November 26, 2017, he released the video clip Dimanche Lokos, in which he announced the release date of his next mixtape, ''Eur\u00eaka'', which will be released on December 8, only on digital platforms.\n\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums and mixtapes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

We can choose <math>a</math> to be the principal root of <math>a^2</math>, and impose the restriction <math>-\\pi /2  < x < \\pi /2</math> on <math>\\theta</math> by using the inverse sine function.\n\nFor a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change.  For example, as <math>x</math> goes from <math>0</math> to <math>a/2</math>, then <math>\\sin \\theta</math> goes from <math>0</math> to <math>1/2</math>, so <math>\\theta</math> goes from <math>0</math> to <math>\\pi / 6</math>.  Then,\n\n:<math>\\int_0^{a/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}=\\int_0^{\\pi/6} d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}.</math>\n\nSome care is needed when picking the bounds. Because integration above requires that <math>-\\pi /2  < x < \\pi /2</math> , <math>\\theta</math> can only go from <math>0</math> to <math>\\pi / 6</math>. Neglecting this restriction, one might have picked <math>\\theta</math> to go from <math>\\pi</math> to <math>5\\pi /6</math>, which would have resulted in the negative of the actual value.\n\nAlternatively, fully evaluate the indefinite integrals before applying the boundary conditions.

The Church was issued a formal apology by the Presbytery of Los Ranchos in 2014 for non action more than seven decades earlier during World War II. The apology explained that \"while members of the Japanese-American congregation were being relocated, neither the national Presbyterian denomination nor the regional presbytery took a stand on behalf of their members, taking a mostly hands-off position.\" The Presbytery of Los Ranchos determined the Church could retain their property and assets, and would not have to meet a reimbursement requirement for leaving the denomination. The official apology acknowledged, \"though we cannot remove the pain that has been experienced as a result of the neglect of our forebears, we wish to extend our deepest apologies to the generations of Wintersburg Presbyterian Church who were and continue to be affected by the abandonment of your brothers and sisters...for the absence of advocacy, the neglect of care and failure of leadership of the church parents we commonly claim, the people of your presbytery humbly request your congregation\u2019s forgiveness.\"<ref>Making Amends: Los Ranchos Presbyterys apologetic dismissal of Wintersburg congregation, The Layman Online, September 2014, http://www.layman.org/making-amends-los-ranchos-presbyterys-apologetic-dismissal-wintersburg-congregation/</ref>\n\n== Japanese Mission Trail ==\nHistoric Wintersburg is considered part of California\u2019s unrecognized Japanese Mission Trail,<ref>Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, [http://historicwintersburg.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-japanese-mission-trail-lost-and-at.html The Japanese Mission Trail: Lost and at-risk history along the Pacific Coast ]</ref> a new term used by ''Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach'', author Mary Adams Urashima, to bring attention to the migration and settlement path of California's Japanese pioneer communities.<ref>Discover Nikkei (2013).

Sturge, who had traveled extensively throughout Asia prior to his role with the Presbyterian Church, was presented the Order of the Rising Sun by the Emperor of Japan for his work with Japanese immigrants in America. Sturge was appointed by the national Presbyterian Church in 1886 to serve as a missionary for the Presbyterian Church in California and named General Superintendent of the Japanese Presbyterian Churches, from 1886 to 1934.<ref>A Buried Past: An Annotated Bibliography of the Japanese American Research Project Collection, Yuji Ichioka, University of California Press, Jan 1, 1974</ref> His biography notes Dr. Sturge and his wife \"cheerfully taught classes of Japanese students who were anxious to learn the English language.\" The couple is acknowledged as among the first to initiate mission efforts in the Japanese immigrant community in America.\n\nIn 1903, colleagues of Dr. Sturge published a book in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of his mission work, The Spirit of Japan,<ref>Hathi Trust Digital Library, [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006559932 The Spirit of Japan]</ref> registered with the Library of Congress on February 11, 1904, by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Reverend Joseph Kenichi Inazawa, who later served as clergy at the Wintersburg Mission.

During World War II, when Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from the West Coast per Executive Order 9066 to confinement centers, the Laguna Beach Japanese Language School was converted by the U.S. military for their use. The Crystal Cove State Park historical timeline notes, \"The purpose was for a coastal defense crew to observe and to furnish data for the guns of a battery for firing at a target.\" After the war, Japanese American farmers who had leased farmland on the Irvine Ranch were unable to reclaim their farms and homes in the San Joaquin Hills.

After working there several years, he made his way to the developing Wintersburg Village in Southern California's Orange County and found work in the celery fields. One of the first people Furuta met was Reverend Hisakichi Terasawa, an Episcopalian minister who had been enlisted by Dr. Ernest Adolphus Sturge and Reverend Joseph Inazawa to help establish a Japanese mission in Orange County.\n\nReverend Terasawa began meeting with Japanese laborers in Wintersburg-area agricultural fields in 1902. Upon the advice of Reverend Terasawa, Furuta saved money to buy land. Together they bought in 1908 the five-acre parcel known today as Historic Wintersburg.<ref>Furuta, Yukiko.

On their return, Furuta contracted with a Caucasian builder to construct a four-room bungalow on his farm. The finishing touches were made on the house by March 1913-documented in a photograph of Yukiko Furuta standing on the front porch-only months before passage of California's [[California Alien Land Law of 1913|Alien Land Law of 1913]] in May of that year.\n\nThe passage of the Alien Land Law meant that Charles Furuta was one of the rare Japanese immigrant landowners in California. Furuta worked for local Caucasian farmers (notably on the Cole Ranch in Wintersburg Village), attempted a farming cooperative with other Japanese immigrant pioneers, as well as farmed his own land.\n\nBy 1917, he had established the first goldfish pond on his property. By the 1920s, goldfish ponds covered most of the Furuta farm, with a variety of common and exotic fish species. Two other goldfish farms were established in Wintersburg Village during the same time period, one by Furuta's brother-in-law Henry Kiyomi Akiyama and one by Tsurumatsu \"T.M.\" Asari. The Furutas, Akiyamas, and Asaris continued to farm goldfish until forcibly removed from California after the authorization of Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, following the December 7, 1941, attack by Japan at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.\n\n==World War II forced removal and confinement==\n\n'''Events following the attack on Pearl Harbor:''' Charles Furuta, owner of the Furuta Gold Fish Farm, and Reverend Sohei Kowta of the Wintersburg Japanese Church were interrogated on the Historic Wintersburg property by the F.B.I. following Pearl Harbor.

Reverend Kowta was allowed to remain with his family and congregation until the time that all Japanese Americans would be forcibly removed from California.\n\nFuruta first was incarcerated at the [[Tuna Canyon Detention Station]], a former [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp in Los Angeles County, California.

There is an entry in the book from Kisaburo Uyeno, His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Consul in San Francisco, noting in 1903 that Sturge already had been living and working with the Japanese in America for twenty years. The Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Mission was the fifth mission established with the help of Dr. Sturge and his colleagues.

During World War II, when Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from the West Coast per Executive Order 9066 to confinement centers, the Laguna Beach Japanese Language School was converted by the U.S. military for their use. The Crystal Cove State Park historical timeline notes, \"The purpose was for a coastal defense crew to observe and to furnish data for the guns of a battery for firing at a target.\" After the war, Japanese American farmers who had leased farmland on the Irvine Ranch were unable to reclaim their farms and homes in the San Joaquin Hills.

Furuta Gold Fish Farm in Wintersburg Village==\n\nCharles Mitsuji Furuta traveled to America in 1900. Intending to meet his older brother, Soichi, in Hawaii, Furuta was prevented from disembarking due to an outbreak of the Black Plague. He continued on to Tacoma, Washington. After working there several years, he made his way to the developing Wintersburg Village in Southern California's Orange County and found work in the celery fields. One of the first people Furuta met was Reverend Hisakichi Terasawa, an Episcopalian minister who had been enlisted by Dr. Ernest Adolphus Sturge and Reverend Joseph Inazawa to help establish a Japanese mission in Orange County.\n\nReverend Terasawa began meeting with Japanese laborers in Wintersburg-area agricultural fields in 1902. Upon the advice of Reverend Terasawa, Furuta saved money to buy land. Together they bought in 1908 the five-acre parcel known today as Historic Wintersburg.<ref>Furuta, Yukiko.

On their return, Furuta contracted with a Caucasian builder to construct a four-room bungalow on his farm. The finishing touches were made on the house by March 1913-documented in a photograph of Yukiko Furuta standing on the front porch-only months before passage of California's [[California Alien Land Law of 1913|Alien Land Law of 1913]] in May of that year.\n\nThe passage of the Alien Land Law meant that Charles Furuta was one of the rare Japanese immigrant landowners in California. Furuta worked for local Caucasian farmers (notably on the Cole Ranch in Wintersburg Village), attempted a farming cooperative with other Japanese immigrant pioneers, as well as farmed his own land.\n\nBy 1917, he had established the first goldfish pond on his property. By the 1920s, goldfish ponds covered most of the Furuta farm, with a variety of common and exotic fish species. Two other goldfish farms were established in Wintersburg Village during the same time period, one by Furuta's brother-in-law Henry Kiyomi Akiyama and one by Tsurumatsu \"T.M.\" Asari. The Furutas, Akiyamas, and Asaris continued to farm goldfish until forcibly removed from California after the authorization of Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, following the December 7, 1941, attack by Japan at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.\n\n==World War II forced removal and confinement==\n\n'''Events following the attack on Pearl Harbor:''' Charles Furuta, owner of the Furuta Gold Fish Farm, and Reverend Sohei Kowta of the Wintersburg Japanese Church were interrogated on the Historic Wintersburg property by the F.B.I. following Pearl Harbor. Charles was interrogated in the sunroom of the 1912 Furuta bungalow. Reverend Kowta was interrogated in the 1934 Wintersburg Japanese Church offices. Reverend Kowta was allowed to remain with his family and congregation until the time that all Japanese Americans would be forcibly removed from California.\n\nFuruta first was incarcerated at the [[Tuna Canyon Detention Station]], a former [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp in Los Angeles County, California.

Confined for three years, the Furutas were released to return home to their farm in Wintersburg Village in 1945.\n\nUpon the Furuta family's return to their Wintersburg Village farm, they found the goldfish ponds silted in and the farmland in disrepair.
