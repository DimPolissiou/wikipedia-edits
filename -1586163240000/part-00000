No definitive length of the [[Pan-American Highway|Pan American Highway]] exists because the Canadian government has never officially defined any specific route as being part of the Pan-American Highway, while in the U.S., the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) has designated the entire [[Interstate Highway System]] part of the Pan-American Highway System, although this has not yet been reinforced by any official highway signage.<ref>[[American Automobile Association]], [[American Motorist]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yr8nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Under+the+numerical%22 ca. 1974]<!--FIXME needs a more precise citation--></ref><ref>[[New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department]], [http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/contents/445/Memorial.pdf State of New Mexico Memorial Designations and Dedications of Highways, Structures and Buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081405/http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/contents/445/Memorial.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}, 2007, p. 14</ref> Mexico officially has many branches connecting to various interstate highways at the U.S. border.\n\n== United States (Alaska) ==\n[[Image:Alaska Highway1.png|240px|right|thumb|Map of the ''Alaska Highway'' portion (in red) of the Pan-American Highway system]]\nThe Pan-American Highway unofficially begins in [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]], Alaska near [[Deadhorse]]. Traveling south to [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], Alaska, the Highway follows the length of the [[Dalton Highway]] (Alaska Route 11) and [[Alaska Route 2]]. (Dalton Highway was the subject of the [[BBC|BBC's]] first episode of ''[[World's Most Dangerous Roads]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014hnld|title=Alaska, Series 1, World's Most Dangerous Roads - BBC Two|website=BBC|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref>) From Fairbanks, Alaska's third largest city, the Pan-American Highway and the [[Alaska Highway]] are one and the same, following Alaska Route 2 southeast to the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] southeast of [[Northway, Alaska|Northway]], Alaska, and adjacent to the [[Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n''Note: The Pan-American Highway reenters the U.S., potentially in several locations along the U.S.-Canada border.''\n\n== Canada ==\n\n=== Yukon ===\nCrossing the border into Canada, Alaska Highway 2 turns into Yukon Highway 1. The first significant settlement along the way is [[Beaver Creek, Yukon]]. At [[Haines Junction]], where it meets [[Haines Highway|Yukon Highway 3]], Yukon Highway 1 turns east toward [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], the capital of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpw.gov.yk.ca/pdf/roadmap.pdf|title=Yukon road map|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hpw.gov.yk.ca|access-date=August 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThrough most of Whitehorse, [[Klondike Highway|Yukon Highway 2]] and Yukon Highway 1 share an alignment. Yukon Highway 1 cuts southeast toward [[Marsh Lake, Yukon]] while Yukon Highway 2 cuts south to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], Alaska. Eventually, Yukon Highway 1 intersects with [[Tagish Road|Yukon Highway 8]] and [[Atlin Road|Yukon Highway 7]] at [[Jake's Corner, Yukon]]; the Pan-American Highway continues on Yukon 1 east-northeast from this junction.\n\nAt [[Johnson's Crossing, Yukon|Johnson's Crossing]], Yukon Highway 1 meets [[Canol Road|Yukon Highway 6]] and travels southeast through [[Teslin, Yukon]]. The Pan-American Highway continues on Yukon 1 as it crosses over into [[British Columbia]] (B. C.). After several miles, the Highway reenters the Yukon (once again as Highway 1) and continues southeast of [[Watson Lake, Yukon|Watson Lake]] until it, once again, enters British Columbia as B.C. Highway 97.\n\n=== British Columbia ===\nAfter travelling about {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} past the B.C.-Yukon border, the Pan-American Highway reaches the first settlement in British Columbia at [[Lower Post, British Columbia|Lower Post]]. After travelling about {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} east, the highway ''once again'' re-enters the Yukon for roughly {{convert|8|mi|km}}. The Highway then re-enters British Columbia (as B.C. 97) for the final time. The Pan-American Highway continues south to southeast through a long uninhabited stretch until it passes through the villages of [[Fireside, British Columbia|Fireside]] and [[Coal River, British Columbia|Coal River]], then runs east parallel to the [[Liard River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellobc.com/getmedia/0de8a359-2d38-4200-bc5e-5bb5ee763c41/maps-british-columbia.aspx|title=Road map of British Columbia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hellobc.com|access-date=August 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Pan-American Highway continues on B.C. Highway 97 as it passes through [[Toad River, British Columbia|Toad River Post]], and then Summit Lake, which is nested between Stone Mountain and Mount Saint George. Further down the road, B.C. Highway 97 intersects with B.C. Highway 77; the Pan-American Highway continues along B.C. 97 east to [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]].\n\nFrom Fort Nelson, the Highway travels south for about {{convert|290|km|abbr=on}} until it reaches [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]]. It continues on B.C. Highway 97 southeast for another {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} to reach the end of the Alaska Highway at [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]].\n\n''Canada's length of the Pan-American Highway is neither official nor defined beyond the end of the Alaska Highway.''\n\n===Alberta===\nAfter B.C Highway 97, the unofficial route becomes [[Alberta Highway 43]]. In approximately {{convert|7.2|km|abbr=on}}, Highway 43 enters into the first settlement Demmitt. For about {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}}, Highway 43 goes into [[Grande Prairie]]. At [[Clairmont, Alberta|Clairmont]], Highway 43, turns to [[Alberta Highway 2]], Highway 43 goes left. Highway 43 goes for {{convert|455|km|abbr=on}} before reaching [[Edmonton]]. The unofficial route turns 2 ways, one way goes to [[Lloydminster]], [[Minneapolis]], and [[Dallas]] and merges with the second way. The second way goes to [[Calgary]] and the US Border. Both ways become the official route. [[Anthony Henday Drive]] is part of the [[Pan-American Highway]].\n\n==United States (Contiguous)==\n''Note: The Pan-American Highway is almost never referred to by name in the U.S. because of its correlation with the Interstate Highway System rather than any singular route.''\n\nIn 1932, a bill{{Specify|date=May 2009}} introduced in the U.S. Congress proposed, among other roads, a route from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], Minnesota, to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], Texas, to connect with the Pan-American Highway in Mexico; this route probably followed today's [[Interstate 35]]. When the section of Interstate 35 in [[San Antonio]], Texas was built, it was named the [[Pan Am Expressway]], as it lies along this route. However, this route was never singularly named the Pan-American Highway.\n\nInterstate 25 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], is named the Pan-American Freeway and it, along with part of [[Interstate 10]] and [[U.S. Route 85]], is officially part of the [[CanAm Highway]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 81]] is claimed to be part of the Pan American Highway from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas, to [[Watertown, South Dakota|Watertown]], South Dakota, where it runs separately from [[Interstate 29]].\n\n[[Interstate 69]] from the Canada\u2013United States border in [[Michigan]] to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] in south Texas has been referred to as the [[NAFTA Superhighway]] which, when completed, will link to an official branch of the Pan-American Highway after crossing the border  Laredo, Texas, and [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]].\n\n== Mexico ==\nThe Pan-American Highway unofficially has four terminals entering into Mexico. It is more generally known as the [[Inter-American Highway]] in that country and officially begins at the border crossing between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas.\n\n[[Image:Inter-American Highway map October 1933.jpg|thumb|300px|1933 map of the Inter-American Highway portion of the Pan-American Highway.]]In Nuevo Laredo, the [[Mexican Federal Highway 85]] splits into two routes to [[Monterrey]], the alternate being the [[toll highway|tolled]] [[Mexican Federal Highway 85D]]. Nuevo Laredo is considered Latin America's largest [[inland port]] with [[International bridges in Laredo, Texas|four international bridges]] into the USA.\n\nMonterrey, the third-largest city in Mexico, is located {{convert|225|km|abbr=on}} from Nuevo Laredo. The Pan-American Highway continues south on Mexican 85, which is a divided limited-access highway until just past the village of [[Hualahuises]]. This is the beginning of an undivided stretch of the Pan-American Highway which parallels then cuts through the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains.\n\nFrom Monterrey to Hualahuises is about {{convert|105|km|abbr=on}}. The highway continues south as Mexico 85 for another {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} until it reaches [[Ciudad Victoria]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} past the village of [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Linares]], the Pan-American or Inter-American Highway enters the state of [[Tamaulipas]].\n\nFrom Ciudad Victoria, the highway continues south as Mexico 85 for about {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} to [[Ciudad Mante]], and about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} further to [[Ciudad Valles]]. About halfway to Ciudad Valles, the Pan-American Highway enters the state of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]].\n\nFrom Ciudad Valles to [[Zimap\u00e1n]] is about {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} of winding mountain road; Zimap\u00e1n is in the state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]. From Zimap\u00e1n to the Hidalgo state capital of [[Pachuca]] is about {{convert|122|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nUpon entering Pachuca, the Pan-American Highway becomes again a divided limited-access route. About {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Pachuca, the alternate to Mexico 85 as it enters the state of [[Mexico (state)|M\u00e9xico]] is the toll Highway 85D. The [[Teotihuacan]] ruins are near this segment of the highway. The highway continues another {{convert|32|to|40|km|abbr=on}} before entering the Mexico City metropolitan area in the suburb of [[Ecatepec de Morelos]].\n\nThe Pan-American Highway (as Mexico Highway 85D) enters Mexico City,<ref>[http://www.go-panamerican.com/road-tips.php \"Road Tips.\"] (Pan-American Highway). [http://www.go-panamerican.com Go-panamerican.com]. Accessed June 2011.</ref> but downtown Mexico City can be bypassed using Mexico Highway 136 (a divided limited-access route) and Mexico Highway 115, which reconnects to Mexico Highway 95D south of the [[Mexican Federal District]].\n\nAs the Pan-American Highway continues south of Mexico City, it runs through the city of [[Cuernavaca]] about {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of the Mexican capital. Here, the Pan-American Highway heads east along [[Mexican Federal Highway 190|Federal Highway 190]] through the state of [[Puebla]]; for about {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}}, it is a limited-access divided highway. The route then reverts to an undivided highway and enters the state of [[Oaxaca]]. From [[Huajuapan de Le\u00f3n]] to the Oaxaca state capital of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] is about {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom the city of Oaxaca, the Highway continues southeast as Mexico Highway 190 for about {{convert|230|km|abbr=on}} to the village of [[Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza]]. The Pan-American Highway is now in southern Mexico, which is a combination of small mountains, hills, and jungles. It is another {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the border with the state of [[Chiapas]] where the Highway crosses the [[Continental Divide]]. From the Oaxaca-Chiapas state border, it is {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} to the Chiapas state capital of [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]]. The Highway then crosses the [[Guatemala\u2013Mexico border|Mexico-Guatemala border]] at [[Ciudad Cuauht\u00e9moc, Chiapas|Ciudad Cuauht\u00e9moc]].\n\n== Guatemala ==\n\nUpon crossing into Guatemala, Mexico Highway 190 becomes Central America Highway 1 and continues for about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} from the border village of [[La Mesilla]] to the city of [[Huehuetenango]] near the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins of [[Zaculeu]]. The Pan-American Highway crosses the Continental Divide again, and into the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]] mountains.\n\nFrom Huehuetenango to [[Chimaltenango]] is roughly {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} with Mayan ruins at [[Iximch\u00e9]], just north of [[Tecp\u00e1n Guatemala]]. From Chimaltenango, it is about {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}} to [[Guatemala City]], the capital and largest city in Central America.\n\nFrom Guatemala City to [[Cuilapa]] is about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} and another {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}} to [[Jutiapa]]. The highway continues as CA Highway 1 and approaches the [[Guatemala\u2013El Salvador border|border with El Salvador]]. It is {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} to the border crossing at San Cristobal Frontera.\n\n== El Salvador ==\n\n[[El Salvador]] is the smallest country (by area) along the route of the Pan-American Highway. After crossing into El Salvador at [[Candelaria de la Frontera]], the Inter-American Highway continues on toward [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] as Central America Highway 1. From the border crossing to Santa Ana is about {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom Santa Ana it's about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} [[San Salvador, El Salvador]]'s capital and largest city. At [[Nueva San Salvador]], the highway passes near the Volcano de San Salvador.\n\nFrom San Salvador to [[Cojutepeque]] is about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}; following the highway southeast to [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is about {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}}. From San Miguel to the [[El Salvador-Honduras border]] is about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Honduras ==\n\nFrom the border crossing to [[Nacaome]] is about {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}. Just past Nacaome is a highway traveling north to [[Tegucigalpa]], the capital of Honduras. Traveling south, it is {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} to [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]], the fourth-largest city in Honduras. From Choluteca to the border crossing, just past [[San Marcos de Col\u00f3n]], is about {{convert|68|km|abbr=on}}. The Pan-American Highway's total distance in Honduras is about {{convert|148|km|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Nicaragua ==\n\nFrom the crossing at the [[Honduras-Nicaragua border]], the highway continues as Central America Highway 1 to the town of [[Ocotal]], about {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}}. From Ocotal to [[Estel\u00ed]] is about {{convert|58|km|abbr=on}}, and on to the village of [[S\u00e9baco]] is about {{convert|46|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At this point, the Inter-American Highway turns from southeast to south towards [[Ciudad Dar\u00edo]], which is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from S\u00e9baco. From Ciudad Dario to the village of [[San Benito, Nicaragua|San Benito]] is {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom San Benito, it is about {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the Nicaraguan capital and largest city of [[Managua]], on the shores of [[Lake Managua]]. From Managua south to the town of [[Jinotepe, Carazo|Jinotepe]] is about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}}, and Jinotepe to the town of [[Rivas, Nicaragua|Rivas]] is about {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Around this area the Highway is in view of [[Lake Nicaragua]], which is the largest lake in Central America. From Rivas to the [[Nicaragua-Costa Rica border]] is about {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Costa Rica ==\n\n[[Costa Rica]] is the second-smallest Central American country in area after El Salvador. After entering Costa Rica, the Highway separates two national parks, the [[Santa Rosa National Park]] to the west and [[Guanacaste National Park (Costa Rica)|Guanacaste National Park]] to the east. From the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border to the town of [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]] is about 76.8&nbsp;km (47.7&nbsp;mi). In the region of Costa Rica, the Pan-American Highway runs just west of the [[Guanacaste Cordillera|Cordillera de Guanacaste]] (Guanacaste Mountains), which includes the active [[volcano]]es of [[Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja Volcano|Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja]] and [[Miravalles Volcano|Miravalles]]. While travelling through Costa Rica north of San Jose, the highway route is known as Costa Rica Highway 1 instead of CA Highway 1. From San Jose south to Panama, the highway route is known as Costa Rica Highway 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transito.go.cr/estadorutas/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627074624/http://www.transito.go.cr/estadorutas/index.html |archivedate=June 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLiberia to the town of [[Barranca, Costa Rica|Barranca]] is 120&nbsp;km (74.5&nbsp;mi) from Barranca, the [[Cordillera de Tilar\u00e1n]] (Tilar\u00e1n Mountains) can be seen from the Inter-American Highway. The Tilar\u00e1n range includes [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]], one of the world's most active volcanoes. From Barranca, the highway heads east across the mountains and the Continental Divide once again. From Barranca, it is roughly 77&nbsp;km (47.8&nbsp;mi) to the town of [[Alajuela]].\n\nAfter Alajuela the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]] (Central Mountains) come into view from the Inter-American Highway. The Central Mountains include four large volcanoes--[[Po\u00e1s Volcano|Po\u00e1s]], [[Barva Volcano|Barva]], [[Iraz\u00fa Volcano|Iraz\u00fa]] and [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]]. From Alajuela to San Jos\u00e9 is about 15&nbsp;km (9.5&nbsp;mi)\n\n[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]] is the capital and largest city in Costa Rica. Leaving San Jos\u00e9, the Inter-American Highway winds its way roughly southeast. From San Jos\u00e9 to [[San Isidro de El General]] is about 136&nbsp;km (84&nbsp;mi)\n\nFrom San Isidro, the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] (Talamanca Mountains) rise up from the rain forest canopy. The Talamanca range, which is non-volcanic, includes [[Cerro Chirrip\u00f3]], Costa Rica's highest mountain peak at {{convert|3820|m|ft}}. From San Isidro to [[Palmar Sur]] is roughly 122&nbsp;km (76.1&nbsp;mi), and Palmar Sur to the [[Costa Rica\u2013Panama border|Costa Rica-Panama border]] is about 91.9&nbsp;km (57.1&nbsp;mi).\n\n== Panama ==\n\nFrom the Costa Rica-Panama border to the village of La Concepci\u00f3n is about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, and from La Concepci\u00f3n to the city of [[David, Chiriqu\u00ed|David]] is about another {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}}. The highway enters Panama traveling generally from west to east.\n\nDavid, the capital of the [[Chiriqu\u00ed Province|Chiriqui Province]], is located about {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north of the town of [[Pedregal, Panam\u00e1 District|Pedregal]] and the [[Gulf of Chiriqu\u00ed]]. From David, the Highway travels east about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to [[Tol\u00e9]]. From Tol\u00e9 to the town of [[Santiago, Panama|Santiago]] is about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}, about halfway to Santiago, the Inter-American Highway crosses over the [[San Pablo River (Panama)|San Pablo river]].\n\nFrom Santiago to [[Aguadulce, Panama|Aguadulce]] is about {{convert|61|km|}}, where the Pan-American Highway (still CA Highway 1) reenters the tropical lowlands. From Aguadulce to [[Penonom\u00e9, Cocl\u00e9|Penonom\u00e9]] is about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. This stretch of highway crosses the [[Santa Maria River (Panama)|Santa Mar\u00eda river]].\n\nFrom Penonom\u00e9, the highway travels southeast, then northeast, then roughly north in a loop as it avoids crossing into Panama's Central Mountains. From Penonom\u00e9 to [[La Chorrera, Panama|La Chorerra]] is about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}. From La Chorerra, it is only about {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} to [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] just west of [[Panama City]].\n\nPanama City is the capital and largest city in Panama. Before entering the city, the Pan-American Highway crosses over the [[Panama Canal]] on the [[Centennial Bridge, Panama|Centennial Bridge]], From Panama City, the Highway turns northeast. From Panama City to [[Chepo, Panam\u00e1 Province|Chepo]] is roughly {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}}; from Chepo to [[Ca\u00f1ita, Panama|Ca\u00f1ita]] is another {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nAt the village of Ca\u00f1ita is the old terminus of the northern route of the Pan-American Highway. The highway continues another {{convert|110|mi|km}} past Ca\u00f1ita to the village of [[Yaviza]], however, this stretch of highway is extremely remote. Yaviza is a village near the junction of the [[Tuira River|Tuira]] and [[Chucunaque River|Chucunaque]] rivers. It is here that the Inter-American Highway officially ends and, consequently, the northern Pan-American Highway. From Yaviza southeast lies the virtually-impenetrable [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], a {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} stretch of rugged, mountainous jungle terrain.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*Plan Federal Highway System, [[New York Times]], May 15, 1932 page XX7\n*Reported from the Motor World, [[New York Times]], January 26, 1936 page XX6\n*Rand McNally Road Atlas, 1998 edition, p.&nbsp;120, {{ISBN|0-528-83918-7}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060906215308/http://www.mesoamericaonline.net/map.htm Institute for Central American Studies \u2013 Costa Rica map]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040113011257/http://patepluma.virtualave.net/patemaps.htm Maps for DXers by Don Moore]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027092039/http://geocities.com/marcelmonterie/links.htm Road numbering systems by Marcel Monterie (links page)]\n\n[[Category:Pan-American Highway|North America]]\n[[Category:Road transportation in North America]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the [[Pan-American Highway]]'s routing in North America|the South American portion|Pan-American Highway (South America)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2011}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}\n[[Image:PanAmericanHwy.png|thumb|275px|The Pan American Highway from [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]], Alaska to [[Ushuaia]], Argentina, with selected official and unofficial routes shown through the U.S.A. and Canada.]]\nThe '''Pan-American Highway route in North America''' is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000&nbsp;km in length which travels through the mainland nations of the Americas.

Traveling south to [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], Alaska, the Highway follows the length of the [[Dalton Highway]] (Alaska Route 11) and [[Alaska Route 2]]. (Dalton Highway was the subject of the [[BBC|BBC's]] first episode of ''[[World's Most Dangerous Roads]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014hnld|title=Alaska, Series 1, World's Most Dangerous Roads - BBC Two|website=BBC|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref>) From Fairbanks, Alaska's third largest city, the Pan-American Highway and the [[Alaska Highway]] are one and the same, following Alaska Route 2 southeast to the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] southeast of [[Northway, Alaska|Northway]], Alaska, and adjacent to the [[Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n''Note: The Pan-American Highway reenters the U.S., potentially in several locations along the U.S.-Canada border.''\n\n== Canada ==\n\n=== Yukon ===\nCrossing the border into Canada, Alaska Highway 2 turns into Yukon Highway 1. The first significant settlement along the way is [[Beaver Creek, Yukon]]. At [[Haines Junction]], where it meets [[Haines Highway|Yukon Highway 3]], Yukon Highway 1 turns east toward [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], the capital of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpw.gov.yk.ca/pdf/roadmap.pdf|title=Yukon road map|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hpw.gov.yk.ca|access-date=August 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThrough most of Whitehorse, [[Klondike Highway|Yukon Highway 2]] and Yukon Highway 1 share an alignment. Yukon Highway 1 cuts southeast toward [[Marsh Lake, Yukon]] while Yukon Highway 2 cuts south to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], Alaska. Eventually, Yukon Highway 1 intersects with [[Tagish Road|Yukon Highway 8]] and [[Atlin Road|Yukon Highway 7]] at [[Jake's Corner, Yukon]]; the Pan-American Highway continues on Yukon 1 east-northeast from this junction.\n\nAt [[Johnson's Crossing, Yukon|Johnson's Crossing]], Yukon Highway 1 meets [[Canol Road|Yukon Highway 6]] and travels southeast through [[Teslin, Yukon]]. The Pan-American Highway continues on Yukon 1 as it crosses over into [[British Columbia]] (B. C.). After several miles, the Highway reenters the Yukon (once again as Highway 1) and continues southeast of [[Watson Lake, Yukon|Watson Lake]] until it, once again, enters British Columbia as B.C. Highway 97.\n\n=== British Columbia ===\nAfter travelling about {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} past the B.C.-Yukon border, the Pan-American Highway reaches the first settlement in British Columbia at [[Lower Post, British Columbia|Lower Post]]. After travelling about {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} east, the highway ''once again'' re-enters the Yukon for roughly {{convert|8|mi|km}}. The Highway then re-enters British Columbia (as B.C. 97) for the final time. The Pan-American Highway continues south to southeast through a long uninhabited stretch until it passes through the villages of [[Fireside, British Columbia|Fireside]] and [[Coal River, British Columbia|Coal River]], then runs east parallel to the [[Liard River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellobc.com/getmedia/0de8a359-2d38-4200-bc5e-5bb5ee763c41/maps-british-columbia.aspx|title=Road map of British Columbia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hellobc.com|access-date=August 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Pan-American Highway continues on B.C. Highway 97 as it passes through [[Toad River, British Columbia|Toad River Post]], and then Summit Lake, which is nested between Stone Mountain and Mount Saint George. Further down the road, B.C. Highway 97 intersects with B.C. Highway 77; the Pan-American Highway continues along B.C. 97 east to [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]].\n\nFrom Fort Nelson, the Highway travels south for about {{convert|290|km|abbr=on}} until it reaches [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]]. It continues on B.C. Highway 97 southeast for another {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} to reach the end of the Alaska Highway at [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]].\n\n''Canada's length of the Pan-American Highway is neither official nor defined beyond the end of the Alaska Highway.''\n\n===Alberta===\nAfter B.C Highway 97, the unofficial route becomes [[Alberta Highway 43]]. In approximately {{convert|7.2|km|abbr=on}}, Highway 43 enters into the first settlement Demmitt. For about {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}}, Highway 43 goes into [[Grande Prairie]]. At [[Clairmont, Alberta|Clairmont]], Highway 43, turns to [[Alberta Highway 2]], Highway 43 goes left. Highway 43 goes for {{convert|455|km|abbr=on}} before reaching [[Edmonton]]. The unofficial route turns 2 ways, one way goes to [[Lloydminster]], [[Minneapolis]], and [[Dallas]] and merges with the second way. The second way goes to [[Calgary]] and the US Border. Both ways become the official route. [[Anthony Henday Drive]] is part of the [[Pan-American Highway]].\n\n==United States (Contiguous)==\n''Note: The Pan-American Highway is almost never referred to by name in the U.S. because of its correlation with the Interstate Highway System rather than any singular route.''\n\nIn 1932, a bill{{Specify|date=May 2009}} introduced in the U.S. Congress proposed, among other roads, a route from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], Minnesota, to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], Texas, to connect with the Pan-American Highway in Mexico; this route probably followed today's [[Interstate 35]]. When the section of Interstate 35 in [[San Antonio]], Texas was built, it was named the [[Pan Am Expressway]], as it lies along this route. However, this route was never singularly named the Pan-American Highway.\n\nInterstate 25 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], is named the Pan-American Freeway and it, along with part of [[Interstate 10]] and [[U.S. Route 85]], is officially part of the [[CanAm Highway]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 81]] is claimed to be part of the Pan American Highway from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas, to [[Watertown, South Dakota|Watertown]], South Dakota, where it runs separately from [[Interstate 29]].\n\n[[Interstate 69]] from the Canada\u2013United States border in [[Michigan]] to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] in south Texas has been referred to as the [[NAFTA Superhighway]] which, when completed, will link to an official branch of the Pan-American Highway after crossing the border  Laredo, Texas, and [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]].\n\n== Mexico ==\nThe Pan-American Highway unofficially has four terminals entering into Mexico. It is more generally known as the [[Inter-American Highway]] in that country and officially begins at the border crossing between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas.\n\n[[Image:Inter-American Highway map October 1933.jpg|thumb|300px|1933 map of the Inter-American Highway portion of the Pan-American Highway.]]In Nuevo Laredo, the [[Mexican Federal Highway 85]] splits into two routes to [[Monterrey]], the alternate being the [[toll highway|tolled]] [[Mexican Federal Highway 85D]]. Nuevo Laredo is considered Latin America's largest [[inland port]] with [[International bridges in Laredo, Texas|four international bridges]] into the USA.\n\nMonterrey, the third-largest city in Mexico, is located {{convert|225|km|abbr=on}} from Nuevo Laredo. The Pan-American Highway continues south on Mexican 85, which is a divided limited-access highway until just past the village of [[Hualahuises]]. This is the beginning of an undivided stretch of the Pan-American Highway which parallels then cuts through the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains.\n\nFrom Monterrey to Hualahuises is about {{convert|105|km|abbr=on}}. The highway continues south as Mexico 85 for another {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} until it reaches [[Ciudad Victoria]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} past the village of [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Linares]], the Pan-American or Inter-American Highway enters the state of [[Tamaulipas]].\n\nFrom Ciudad Victoria, the highway continues south as Mexico 85 for about {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} to [[Ciudad Mante]], and about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} further to [[Ciudad Valles]]. About halfway to Ciudad Valles, the Pan-American Highway enters the state of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]].\n\nFrom Ciudad Valles to [[Zimap\u00e1n]] is about {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} of winding mountain road; Zimap\u00e1n is in the state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]. From Zimap\u00e1n to the Hidalgo state capital of [[Pachuca]] is about {{convert|122|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nUpon entering Pachuca, the Pan-American Highway becomes again a divided limited-access route. About {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Pachuca, the alternate to Mexico 85 as it enters the state of [[Mexico (state)|M\u00e9xico]] is the toll Highway 85D. The [[Teotihuacan]] ruins are near this segment of the highway. The highway continues another {{convert|32|to|40|km|abbr=on}} before entering the Mexico City metropolitan area in the suburb of [[Ecatepec de Morelos]].\n\nThe Pan-American Highway (as Mexico Highway 85D) enters Mexico City,<ref>[http://www.go-panamerican.com/road-tips.php \"Road Tips.\"] (Pan-American Highway). [http://www.go-panamerican.com Go-panamerican.com]. Accessed June 2011.</ref> but downtown Mexico City can be bypassed using Mexico Highway 136 (a divided limited-access route) and Mexico Highway 115, which reconnects to Mexico Highway 95D south of the [[Mexican Federal District]].\n\nAs the Pan-American Highway continues south of Mexico City, it runs through the city of [[Cuernavaca]] about {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of the Mexican capital. Here, the Pan-American Highway heads east along [[Mexican Federal Highway 190|Federal Highway 190]] through the state of [[Puebla]]; for about {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}}, it is a limited-access divided highway. The route then reverts to an undivided highway and enters the state of [[Oaxaca]]. From [[Huajuapan de Le\u00f3n]] to the Oaxaca state capital of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] is about {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom the city of Oaxaca, the Highway continues southeast as Mexico Highway 190 for about {{convert|230|km|abbr=on}} to the village of [[Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza]]. The Pan-American Highway is now in southern Mexico, which is a combination of small mountains, hills, and jungles. It is another {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the border with the state of [[Chiapas]] where the Highway crosses the [[Continental Divide]]. From the Oaxaca-Chiapas state border, it is {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} to the Chiapas state capital of [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]]. The Highway then crosses the [[Guatemala\u2013Mexico border|Mexico-Guatemala border]] at [[Ciudad Cuauht\u00e9moc, Chiapas|Ciudad Cuauht\u00e9moc]].\n\n== Guatemala ==\n\nUpon crossing into Guatemala, Mexico Highway 190 becomes Central America Highway 1 and continues for about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} from the border village of [[La Mesilla]] to the city of [[Huehuetenango]] near the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins of [[Zaculeu]]. The Pan-American Highway crosses the Continental Divide again, and into the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]] mountains.\n\nFrom Huehuetenango to [[Chimaltenango]] is roughly {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} with Mayan ruins at [[Iximch\u00e9]], just north of [[Tecp\u00e1n Guatemala]]. From Chimaltenango, it is about {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}} to [[Guatemala City]], the capital and largest city in Central America.\n\nFrom Guatemala City to [[Cuilapa]] is about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} and another {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}} to [[Jutiapa]]. The highway continues as CA Highway 1 and approaches the [[Guatemala\u2013El Salvador border|border with El Salvador]]. It is {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} to the border crossing at San Cristobal Frontera.\n\n== El Salvador ==\n\n[[El Salvador]] is the smallest country (by area) along the route of the Pan-American Highway. After crossing into El Salvador at [[Candelaria de la Frontera]], the Inter-American Highway continues on toward [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] as Central America Highway 1. From the border crossing to Santa Ana is about {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom Santa Ana it's about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} [[San Salvador, El Salvador]]'s capital and largest city. At [[Nueva San Salvador]], the highway passes near the Volcano de San Salvador.\n\nFrom San Salvador to [[Cojutepeque]] is about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}; following the highway southeast to [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is about {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}}. From San Miguel to the [[El Salvador-Honduras border]] is about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Honduras ==\n\nFrom the border crossing to [[Nacaome]] is about {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}. Just past Nacaome is a highway traveling north to [[Tegucigalpa]], the capital of Honduras. Traveling south, it is {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} to [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]], the fourth-largest city in Honduras. From Choluteca to the border crossing, just past [[San Marcos de Col\u00f3n]], is about {{convert|68|km|abbr=on}}. The Pan-American Highway's total distance in Honduras is about {{convert|148|km|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Nicaragua ==\n\nFrom the crossing at the [[Honduras-Nicaragua border]], the highway continues as Central America Highway 1 to the town of [[Ocotal]], about {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}}. From Ocotal to [[Estel\u00ed]] is about {{convert|58|km|abbr=on}}, and on to the village of [[S\u00e9baco]] is about {{convert|46|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At this point, the Inter-American Highway turns from southeast to south towards [[Ciudad Dar\u00edo]], which is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from S\u00e9baco. From Ciudad Dario to the village of [[San Benito, Nicaragua|San Benito]] is {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom San Benito, it is about {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the Nicaraguan capital and largest city of [[Managua]], on the shores of [[Lake Managua]]. From Managua south to the town of [[Jinotepe, Carazo|Jinotepe]] is about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}}, and Jinotepe to the town of [[Rivas, Nicaragua|Rivas]] is about {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Around this area the Highway is in view of [[Lake Nicaragua]], which is the largest lake in Central America. From Rivas to the [[Nicaragua-Costa Rica border]] is about {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Costa Rica ==\n\n[[Costa Rica]] is the second-smallest Central American country in area after El Salvador. After entering Costa Rica, the Highway separates two national parks, the [[Santa Rosa National Park]] to the west and [[Guanacaste National Park (Costa Rica)|Guanacaste National Park]] to the east. From the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border to the town of [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]] is about 76.8 km (47.7 mi). In the region of Costa Rica, the Pan-American Highway runs just west of the [[Guanacaste Cordillera|Cordillera de Guanacaste]] (Guanacaste Mountains), which includes the active [[volcano]]es of [[Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja Volcano|Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja]] and [[Miravalles Volcano|Miravalles]]. While travelling through Costa Rica north of San Jose, the highway route is known as Costa Rica Highway 1 instead of CA Highway 1. From San Jose south to Panama, the highway route is known as Costa Rica Highway 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transito.go.cr/estadorutas/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627074624/http://www.transito.go.cr/estadorutas/index.html |archivedate=June 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLiberia to the town of [[Barranca, Costa Rica|Barranca]] is 120 km (74.5 mi) from Barranca, the [[Cordillera de Tilar\u00e1n]] (Tilar\u00e1n Mountains) can be seen from the Inter-American Highway. The Tilar\u00e1n range includes [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]], one of the world's most active volcanoes. From Barranca, the highway heads east across the mountains and the Continental Divide once again. From Barranca, it is roughly 77 km (47.8 mi) to the town of [[Alajuela]].\n\nAfter Alajuela the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]] (Central Mountains) come into view from the Inter-American Highway. The Central Mountains include four large volcanoes--[[Po\u00e1s Volcano|Po\u00e1s]], [[Barva Volcano|Barva]], [[Iraz\u00fa Volcano|Iraz\u00fa]] and [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]]. From Alajuela to San Jos\u00e9 is about 15 km (9.5 mi)\n\n[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]] is the capital and largest city in Costa Rica. Leaving San Jos\u00e9, the Inter-American Highway winds its way roughly southeast. From San Jos\u00e9 to [[San Isidro de El General]] is about 136 km (84 mi)\n\nFrom San Isidro, the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] (Talamanca Mountains) rise up from the rain forest canopy. The Talamanca range, which is non-volcanic, includes [[Cerro Chirrip\u00f3]], Costa Rica's highest mountain peak at {{convert|3820|m|ft}}. From San Isidro to [[Palmar Sur]] is roughly 122 km (76.1 mi), and Palmar Sur to the [[Costa Rica\u2013Panama border|Costa Rica-Panama border]] is about 91.9 km (57.1 mi).\n\n== Panama ==\n\nFrom the Costa Rica-Panama border to the village of La Concepci\u00f3n is about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, and from La Concepci\u00f3n to the city of [[David, Chiriqu\u00ed|David]] is about another {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}}. The highway enters Panama traveling generally from west to east.\n\nDavid, the capital of the [[Chiriqu\u00ed Province|Chiriqui Province]], is located about {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north of the town of [[Pedregal, Panam\u00e1 District|Pedregal]] and the [[Gulf of Chiriqu\u00ed]]. From David, the Highway travels east about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to [[Tol\u00e9]]. From Tol\u00e9 to the town of [[Santiago, Panama|Santiago]] is about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}, about halfway to Santiago, the Inter-American Highway crosses over the [[San Pablo River (Panama)|San Pablo river]].\n\nFrom Santiago to [[Aguadulce, Panama|Aguadulce]] is about {{convert|61|km|}}, where the Pan-American Highway (still CA Highway 1) reenters the tropical lowlands. From Aguadulce to [[Penonom\u00e9, Cocl\u00e9|Penonom\u00e9]] is about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. This stretch of highway crosses the [[Santa Maria River (Panama)|Santa Mar\u00eda river]].\n\nFrom Penonom\u00e9, the highway travels southeast, then northeast, then roughly north in a loop as it avoids crossing into Panama's Central Mountains. From Penonom\u00e9 to [[La Chorrera, Panama|La Chorerra]] is about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}. From La Chorerra, it is only about {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} to [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] just west of [[Panama City]].\n\nPanama City is the capital and largest city in Panama. Before entering the city, the Pan-American Highway crosses over the [[Panama Canal]] on the [[Centennial Bridge, Panama|Centennial Bridge]], From Panama City, the Highway turns northeast. From Panama City to [[Chepo, Panam\u00e1 Province|Chepo]] is roughly {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}}; from Chepo to [[Ca\u00f1ita, Panama|Ca\u00f1ita]] is another {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nAt the village of Ca\u00f1ita is the old terminus of the northern route of the Pan-American Highway. The highway continues another {{convert|110|mi|km}} past Ca\u00f1ita to the village of [[Yaviza]], however, this stretch of highway is extremely remote. Yaviza is a village near the junction of the [[Tuira River|Tuira]] and [[Chucunaque River|Chucunaque]] rivers.

However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains [[anthropic bias]], as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical [[hypothesis testing]] standpoint, there are zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life (or evidence of past life) were to be found on [[life on Mars|Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]] or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}} close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.\n\nCountering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth\u2014that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for [[bacteria]] that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Davies |first=P.\n |year=2007\n |title=Are Aliens Among Us?\n |journal=[[Scientific American]]\n |volume=297 |issue=6 |pages=62\u201369\n |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1207-62\n|bibcode = 2007SciAm.297f..62D }}</ref> It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways.

Some scenarios such as the [[snowball Earth]] or research into the [[extinction events]] have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past [[life on Mars]] is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}} but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.\n\nEstimates of {{math|''f''<sub>i</sub>}} have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from [[nova]]e).

There is [[Fermi paradox#They choose not to interact with us|considerable speculation]] why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate.

It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including ''reappearance number'', this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the ''reappearance number'' rather than increase in {{math|''L''}}, stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.\n\n[[David Grinspoon]] has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival.

D.\n |year=1983\n |title=The Great Silence \u2013 The Controversy Concerning Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life\n |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]\n |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=283\u2013309\n |bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..283B\n}}</ref>  Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.\n\n;Colonization : It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other [[star system]]s. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity {{mvar|v}}, and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime {{mvar|L}}.  The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.<ref name=\"GS\"/>\n\n;Reappearance factor : The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by ''how many times'' an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next [[Sociocultural evolution|civilization to evolve]]. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be {{math|1 + ''n''<sub>r</sub>}}, which is the actual ''reappearance factor'' added to the equation.\n\n:The factor depends on what generally is the cause of [[civilization extinction]]. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a [[nuclear winter]], then {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as [[stellar evolution]], then {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}}, that is, ''how many times'' life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.\n\n;METI factor : [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]] said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Zaitsev |first=A.\n |date=May 2005\n |title=The Drake Equation: Adding a METI Factor\n |url=http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/Drake_equation.html\n |publisher=[[SETI League]]\n |accessdate=2013-04-20\n}}</ref> He defined the factor as \"the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness\", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.\n\n:The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.\n\n;Biogenic gases : Astronomer [[Sara Seager]] proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases.<ref name=\"NYT-20161207\">{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Chris |title='The World Sees Me as the One Who Will Find Another Earth' \u2013 The star-crossed life of Sara Seager, an astrophysicist obsessed with discovering distant planets. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/the-world-sees-me-as-the-one-who-will-find-another-earth.html |date=7 December 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 December 2016 }}</ref> These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.<ref name=equation>[http://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-seager.html?cid=51463011558824 The Drake Equation Revisited: Interview with Planet Hunter Sara Seager] Devin Powell, ''Astrobiology Magazine''  4 September 2013.</ref>\n\n:The Seager equation looks like this:<ref name=equation />{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The rendering of the equation here is slightly modified for clarity of presentation from the rendering in the cited source.<ref name=equation />}}\n::<math display=block>N = N_* \\cdot F_\\mathrm{Q} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{HZ} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{O} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{L} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{S}</math>\n:where:\n\n::{{math|''N''}} = the number of planets with detectable signs of life\n::{{math|''N''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} = the number of stars observed\n::{{math|''F''<sub>Q</sub>}} = the fraction of stars that are quiet\n::{{math|''F''<sub>HZ</sub>}} = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone\n::{{math|''F''<sub>O</sub>}} = the fraction of those planets that can be observed\n::{{math|''F''<sub>L</sub>}} = the fraction that have life\n::{{math|''F''<sub>S</sub>}} = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas\n\nSeager stresses, \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,\u201d explaining, \u201cSince Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets.

Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics.  No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known.  The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Dvorsky |first=G.\n |date=31 May 2007\n |title=The Drake Equation is obsolete\n |url=http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2007/05/drake-equation-is-obsolete.html\n |work=Sentient Developments\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/42739-stop-using-the-drake-equation.html|title=Alien Hunters, Stop Using the Drake Equation|last=Sutter|first=Paul|date=2018-12-27|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\nOne reply to such criticisms<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Tarter |first=J.\n |date=May\u2013June 2006\n |title=The Cosmic Haystack Is Large\n |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/cosmic_haystack_is_large/\n |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]\n |volume=30 |issue=3\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref> is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics.

This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, {{math|''R''<sub>\u2217</sub> \u00b7 ''f''<sub>p</sub> \u00b7 ''n''<sub>e</sub> \u00b7 ''f''<sub>l</sub> \u00b7 ''f''<sub>i</sub>}}, has a low value.  The most common suspect is {{math|''f''<sub>i</sub>}}, but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that {{math|''n''<sub>e</sub>}} is the small term.\n*Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning {{math|''f''<sub>c</sub>}} is small.  Typical arguments include [[Fermi paradox#Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time|that civilizations are too far apart]], [[Fermi paradox#It is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy|it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy]], [[Fermi paradox#Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time|civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time]], [[Fermi paradox#It is dangerous to communicate|it is dangerous to communicate]], and many others.\n*The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of {{mvar|L}} is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself]], [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others]], [[Fermi paradox#Periodic extinction by natural events|they tend to be destroyed by natural events]], and the said life form not subscribing to what philosophers call 'existential bias'.\n\nThese lines of reasoning lead to the [[Great Filter]] hypothesis,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hanson |first=R.\n |date=15 September 1998\n |title=The Great Filter \u2014 Are We Almost Past It?\n |url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref> which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.\n\n==In fiction and popular culture==\nThe equation was cited by [[Gene Roddenberry]] as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on ''[[Star Trek]]'', the television series he created.

This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral [[hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the [[radio spectrum]].\n\nTwo months later, Harvard University astronomy professor [[Harlow Shapley]] speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying \"The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it.

Using the 25&nbsp;m dish of the [[Green Bank Observatory|National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: [[Epsilon Eridani]] and [[Tau Ceti]]. In this project, which he called [[Project Ozma]], he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21&nbsp;cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960.<ref name=\"history\"/> The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It detected no signals.\n\nSoon thereafter, Drake hosted a \"[[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]\" meeting on detecting their radio signals.

However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains [[anthropic bias]], as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical [[hypothesis testing]] standpoint, there are zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life (or evidence of past life) were to be found on [[life on Mars|Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]] or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}} close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.\n\nCountering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth\u2014that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin.

It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including ''reappearance number'', this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the ''reappearance number'' rather than increase in {{math|''L''}}, stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures.

This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ''ever'' develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than {{val|2.5|e=-24}}. Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than {{val|1.7|e=-11}} (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://phys.org/news/2016-04-limits-uniqueness.html |title= Are we alone?

The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society\".<ref name=\"GS\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Brin |first=G.

Each original site expands with an expansion velocity {{mvar|v}}, and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime {{mvar|L}}.  The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.<ref name=\"GS\"/>\n\n;Reappearance factor : The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by ''how many times'' an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next [[Sociocultural evolution|civilization to evolve]]. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be {{math|1 + ''n''<sub>r</sub>}}, which is the actual ''reappearance factor'' added to the equation.\n\n:The factor depends on what generally is the cause of [[civilization extinction]]. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a [[nuclear winter]], then {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as [[stellar evolution]], then {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}}, that is, ''how many times'' life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.\n\n;METI factor : [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]] said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Zaitsev |first=A.\n |date=May 2005\n |title=The Drake Equation: Adding a METI Factor\n |url=http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/Drake_equation.html\n |publisher=[[SETI League]]\n |accessdate=2013-04-20\n}}</ref> He defined the factor as \"the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness\", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.\n\n:The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.\n\n;Biogenic gases : Astronomer [[Sara Seager]] proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases.<ref name=\"NYT-20161207\">{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Chris |title='The World Sees Me as the One Who Will Find Another Earth' \u2013 The star-crossed life of Sara Seager, an astrophysicist obsessed with discovering distant planets. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/the-world-sees-me-as-the-one-who-will-find-another-earth.html |date=7 December 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 December 2016 }}</ref> These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.<ref name=equation>[http://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-seager.html?cid=51463011558824 The Drake Equation Revisited: Interview with Planet Hunter Sara Seager] Devin Powell, ''Astrobiology Magazine''  4 September 2013.</ref>\n\n:The Seager equation looks like this:<ref name=equation />{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The rendering of the equation here is slightly modified for clarity of presentation from the rendering in the cited source.<ref name=equation />}}\n::<math display=block>N = N_* \\cdot F_\\mathrm{Q} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{HZ} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{O} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{L} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{S}</math>\n:where:\n\n::{{math|''N''}} = the number of planets with detectable signs of life\n::{{math|''N''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} = the number of stars observed\n::{{math|''F''<sub>Q</sub>}} = the fraction of stars that are quiet\n::{{math|''F''<sub>HZ</sub>}} = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone\n::{{math|''F''<sub>O</sub>}} = the fraction of those planets that can be observed\n::{{math|''F''<sub>L</sub>}} = the fraction that have life\n::{{math|''F''<sub>S</sub>}} = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas\n\nSeager stresses, \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,\u201d explaining, \u201cSince Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets.

Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics.  No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known.

Typical arguments include [[Fermi paradox#Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time|that civilizations are too far apart]], [[Fermi paradox#It is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy|it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy]], [[Fermi paradox#Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time|civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time]], [[Fermi paradox#It is dangerous to communicate|it is dangerous to communicate]], and many others.\n*The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of {{mvar|L}} is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself]], [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others]], [[Fermi paradox#Periodic extinction by natural events|they tend to be destroyed by natural events]], and others.\n\nThese lines of reasoning lead to the [[Great Filter]] hypothesis,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hanson |first=R.\n |date=15 September 1998\n |title=The Great Filter \u2014 Are We Almost Past It?\n |url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref> which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.\n\n==In fiction and popular culture==\nThe equation was cited by [[Gene Roddenberry]] as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on ''[[Star Trek]]'', the television series he created.

In this context, the verb \"operate\" means to perform surgery. The adjective '''surgical''' means pertaining to surgery; e.g. [[surgical instrument]]s or [[surgical nurse]]. The person or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. A [[surgeon]] is a person who practices surgery and a [[surgeon's assistant]] is a person who practices surgical assistance. A [[surgical team]] is made up of surgeon, [[surgeon's assistant]], anaesthetist, circulating nurse and [[surgical technologist]]. Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term \"surgery\" can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a [[Doctor's office|physician]],<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doctors-surgery|title=Doctor's surgery|dictionary=Collins English Dictionary|access-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210062151/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doctors-surgery|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[dentist]], or [[veterinarian]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nSurgery is a invasive technique with the fundamental principle of physical intervention on organs/organ systems/tissues for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons.\n\nAs a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a person's tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound.  Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as [[angioplasty]] or [[endoscopy]], may be considered surgery if they involve \"common\" surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, [[anesthesia]], [[antiseptic]] conditions, typical [[surgical instruments]], and [[suturing]] or [[Surgical staple|stapling]].  All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called \"noninvasive surgery\" usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).\n\n=== Types of surgery ===\nSurgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, the degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.\n* Based on timing: [[Elective surgery]] is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the person's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. A [[semi-elective surgery]] is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. [[Emergency medicine|Emergency surgery]] is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity.\n* Based on purpose: [[Exploratory surgery]] is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition. [[Cosmetic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|Cosmetic surgery]] is done to subjectively improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure.\n* By type of procedure: [[Amputation]] involves cutting off a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is also an example. '''Resection''' is the removal of all of an internal organ or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or code designation. '''Excision''' is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the person. '''Extirpation''' is the complete excision or surgical destruction of a body part.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/extirpation|title=extirpation|website=[[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary|accessdate=2020-02-20}}</ref> [[Replantation]] involves reattaching a severed body part. [[Reconstructive surgery]] involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. [[Organ transplant|Transplant]] surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the person undergoing surgery. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.\n* By body part: When surgery is performed on one organ system or structure, it may be classed by the organ, organ system or tissue involved. Examples include cardiac surgery (performed on the heart), gastrointestinal surgery (performed within the digestive tract and its accessory organs), and orthopedic surgery (performed on bones or muscles).\n* By degree of invasiveness of surgical procedures: [[Minimally-invasive procedures|Minimally-invasive surgery]] involves smaller outer incision (s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in [[laparoscopic surgery]] or [[angioplasty]]. By contrast, an [[open surgery|open surgical procedure]] such as a [[laparotomy]] requires a large incision to access the area of interest.\n* By equipment used: [[Laser surgery]] involves use of a [[laser]] for cutting tissue instead of a [[scalpel]] or similar surgical instruments. [[Microsurgery]] involves the use of an operating [[microscope]] for the surgeon to see small structures. [[Robotic surgery]] makes use of a surgical [[robot]], such as the [[Da Vinci Surgical System|Da Vinci]] or the [[ZEUS robotic surgical system]]s, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.\n\n===Terminology===\n{{main|List of surgical procedures}}\n* [[Excision]] surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in '''-ectomy'''.\n* Procedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in '''-otomy'''.  A surgical procedure cutting through the [[abdominal]] wall to gain access to the [[abdominal cavity]] is a [[laparotomy]].\n* [[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally invasive procedures]], involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted, end in '''-oscopy'''.  For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called [[laparoscopy]].\n* Procedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] in the body end in '''-ostomy'''.\n* Reconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in '''-oplasty'''.  ''Rhino'' is used as a prefix for \"nose\", therefore a ''[[rhinoplasty]]'' is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.\n* Repair of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in '''-rraphy'''.\n* Reoperation (return to the operating room) refers to a return to the operating theater after an initial surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care best treated surgically. Reasons for reoperation include persistent bleeding after surgery, development of or persistence of infection.\n\n== Description of surgical procedure ==\n=== Location ===\n[[Inpatient]] surgery is performed in a hospital, and the person undergoing surgery stays at least one night in the hospital after the surgery.

All surgical instruments must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if, it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire ([[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]], a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.\n\n=== Preoperative care ===\n{{main|Preoperative care}}\nPrior to surgery, the person is given a [[medical examination]], receives certain pre-operative tests, and their [[physical fitness|physical status]] is rated according to the [[ASA physical status classification system]]. If these results are satisfactory, the person requiring surgery signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an [[autologous]] [[blood donation]] may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the [[digestive system]], the person requiring surgery may be instructed to perform a [[Whole bowel irrigation|bowel prep]] by drinking a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]] the night before the procedure. People preparing for surgery are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an [[Nil per os|NPO order]] after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the person vomits during or after the procedure.\n\nSome medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly.<ref name=\"ACRfive\">{{Cite journal |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |title = Five Things

The person is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific [[Surgical Positions|surgical position]], then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an \"ether screen\", which separates the [[anesthetist]]/[[anesthesiologist]]'s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Shirley|title=Minor Surgical Procedures for Nurses and Allied Healthcare Professionals|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-470-01990-0|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EaDbhAO3kS8C&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q=osman&f=false}}</ref>\n\n[[Anesthesia]] is administered to prevent [[pain]] from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing.  Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided [[local anesthesia|locally]] or as [[general anesthesia]].  [[Spinal anesthesia]] may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable.  With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the person can remain conscious or minimally sedated.  In contrast, general anesthesia renders the person unconscious and paralyzed during surgery.  The person is [[intubation|intubated]] and is placed on a [[mechanical ventilator]], and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents.\nChoice of surgical method and [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] technique aims to reduce the risk of complications, shorten the time needed for recovery and minimise the [[surgical stress]] response.\n\n===Intraoperative phase===\nThe intraoperative phase begins when the surgery subject is received in the surgical area (such as the [[operating theater]] or surgical [[Hospital#Departments or wards|department]]), and lasts until the subject is transferred to a recovery area (such as a [[post-anesthesia care unit]]).<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=Qogt_LvTi-sC&pg=PA2 Page 2] in: {{cite book | last=Spry | first=Cynthia | title=Essentials of perioperative nursing | publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers | location=Sudbury, Mass | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-7637-5881-3 | oclc=227920274 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAn incision is made to access the surgical site.  [[Blood vessel]]s may be clamped or [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open.  The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum.  In certain cases, [[bone]] may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the [[human skull|skull]] for [[brain]] surgery or cutting the [[Human sternum|sternum]] for [[Thoracic surgery|thoracic (chest) surgery]] to open up the [[rib cage]]. Whilst in surgery [[Asepsis|aseptic technique]] is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the person's body that will be operated on. Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site.

'Global surgery' is the term now adopted to describe the rapidly developing field seeking to address this, and has been defined as 'the multidisciplinary enterprise of providing improved and equitable surgical care to the world's population, with its core tenets as the issues of need, access and quality'.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bath M, Bashford T, Fitzgerald JE |title=What is 'global surgery'?

In the 12th century, [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius Salernitanus]] composed his ''Chirurgia'', laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals.

The professor of anatomy at the [[University of Padua]], [[Andreas Vesalius]], was a pivotal figure in the [[Renaissance]] transition from classical medicine and anatomy based on the works of [[Galen]], to an empirical approach of 'hands-on' dissection. In his anatomic treaties ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', he exposed the many anatomical errors in Galen and advocated that all surgeons should train by engaging in practical dissections themselves.\n\nThe second figure of importance in this era was [[Ambroise Par\u00e9]] (sometimes spelled \"Ambrose\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levine JM |title=Historical notes on pressure ulcers: the cure of Ambrose Par\u00e9 |journal=Decubitus |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=23\u201324, 26 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1558689 }}</ref>), a French army surgeon from the 1530s until his death in 1590.

[[Astley Paston Cooper]] (1768\u20131841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and [[James Syme]] (1799\u20131870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the [[ankle joint]] and successfully carried out the first [[Hemipelvectomy|hip disarticulation]].\n\nModern [[pain]] control through [[anesthesia]] was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of [[anesthesia]], surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient [[suffering]].  This also meant that operations were largely restricted to [[amputation]]s and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as [[diethyl ether|ether]], first used by the American surgeon [[Crawford Long]], and [[chloroform]], discovered by Scottish obstetrician [[James Young Simpson]] and later pioneered by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], physician to [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=H.

In addition, the discovery of [[muscle relaxant]]s such as [[curare]] allowed for safer applications.\n\n====Infection and antisepsis====\nUnfortunately, the introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections.  The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] doctor [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths; however, the [[Royal Society]] dismissed his advice.\n[[File:Joseph Lister2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], pioneer of [[Antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]]]]\nUntil the pioneering work of British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see \"[[Miasma theory of disease|miasma]]\") was responsible for [[infections]] in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient's [[wound]]s were not available.<ref name=\"storyof medicine\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKkCwqDEI9QC&pg=PA420&lpg=PA420&dq=%22good+old+surgical+stink%22#v=onepage&q=%22good%20old%20surgical%20stink%22&f=false | title=The Story of Medicine | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | author=Robinson, Victor | page=420| isbn=978-1-4191-5431-7 |year=2005 }}</ref> Lister became aware of the work of French [[chemist]] [[Louis Pasteur]], who showed that rotting and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] could occur under [[Anaerobic infection|anaerobic conditions]] if [[micro-organisms]] were present.  Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the [[micro-organisms]] responsible for [[gangrene]]: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to [[solution|chemical solutions]]. Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop [[antiseptic]] techniques for wounds.  As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying [[carbolic acid]] on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in ''[[The Lancet]]''.<ref>''The Lancet'', \"On a new method of treating compound fracture, abscess, etc.: with observation on the conditions of suppuration\".<br>Five articles running from:<br>Volume 89, Issue 2272, 16 March 1867, pp. 326\u201329 (Originally published as Volume 1, Issue 2272)<br>\nto:<br>Volume 90, Issue 2291, 27 July 1867, pp. 95\u201396 Originally published as Volume 2, Issue 2291</ref> Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin, on the ''[[Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery]]'', which was reprinted in ''The British Medical Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2310614|volume=2|issue=351|pages=245\u201360|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=21 September 1867|title=On the Antiseptic Principle in the Practice of Surgery|pmid=20744875|author=Lister J|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.351.246}}.

This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister introduced the Steam Steriliser to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. These three crucial advances \u2013 the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment \u2013 laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.\n\nThe use of [[X-rays]] as an important medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German [[physics|physicist]] [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]]. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated [[photographic plate]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Acquapendente - Operationes chirurgicae, 1685 - 2984755.tif|[[Hieronymus Fabricius]], ''Operationes chirurgicae'', 1685\nFile:John Syng Dorsey.jpg|John Syng Dorsey wrote the first American textbook on surgery\nFile:1753 Traversi Operation anagoria.JPG| An operation in 1753, painted by [[Gaspare Traversi]].\n</gallery>\n\n== Surgical specialties ==\n<!--[[Surgical specialties]], [[Surgery specialties]] and [[Specialties in surgery]] redirect here-->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[General surgery]]\n*: {{hlist <!--Alphabetical by linkname:--> }}\n<!--Alphabetical:-->\n* [[Breast surgery|Breast]]\n* [[Cardiothoracic surgery|Cardiothoracic]]\n* [[Colorectal surgery|Colorectal]]\n* [[Craniofacial surgery]]\n* [[Dental surgery]]\n* [[Endocrine surgery|Endocrine]]\n* [[Gynaecology]]\n* [[Neurosurgery]]\n* [[Ophthalmology]]\n* [[Surgical oncology|Oncological]]\n* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n* [[Organ transplantation|Transplant]]\n* [[Orthopaedic surgery]]\n* [[Otolaryngology]]\n* [[Pediatric surgery|Paediatric (Pediatric)]]\n* [[Plastic surgery|Plastic]]\n* [[Podiatric surgery]]\n* [[Skin surgery|Skin]]\n* [[Trauma surgery|Trauma]]\n* [[Urology]]\n* [[Vascular surgery|Vascular]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==National societies==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[American College of Surgeons]]\n* [[American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons]]\n* [[American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons]]\n* [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]\n* [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]]\n* [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]]\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]\n* [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]]\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{div col |colwidth = 22em }}\n* [[Anesthesia]]\n* [[ASA physical status classification system]]\n* [[Biomaterial]]\n* [[Cardiac surgery]]\n* [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT; for [[outpatient]] surgical procedures [[medical coding]])\n* [[Drain (surgery)|Surgical drain]]\n* [[Endoscopy]]\n* [[Fluorescence image-guided surgery]]\n* [[Hypnosurgery]]\n* [[Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project]] (HCUP) \u2013 a family of health care databases etc. from the US\n* [[ICD-10-PCS]] ([[International Classification of Diseases]], 10th edition, Procedural Coding System; [[inpatient]] surgical procedures medical coding)\n* [[Jet ventilation]]\n* [[List of surgical procedures]]\n* [[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally invasive procedure]]\n* [[Operative report]]\n* [[Perioperative mortality]]\n* [[Remote surgery]]\n* [[Robotic surgery]]\n* [[Surgeon's assistant]]\n* [[Surgical Outcomes Analysis and Research]]\n* [[Surgical Sieve]]\n* [[Trauma surgery]]\n* [[Reconstructive surgery]]\n* [[Rheumasurgery]]\n* [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sister project links}}\n{{Medicine}}\n{{Neurosurgical procedures}}\n{{Endocrine system operations and other procedures}}\n{{Eye surgery}}\n{{Operations and other procedures on the ear}}\n{{Operations and other procedures on the nose, mouth, and pharynx}}\n{{Respiratory system surgeries and other procedures}}\n{{Cardiac surgery}}\n{{Vascular surgery procedures}}\n{{Operations and other procedures of the hemic and lymphatic system}}\n{{Digestive system surgical procedures}}\n{{Urologic surgical and other procedures}}\n{{Genital surgical and other procedures}}\n{{Obstetrical procedures}}\n{{Bone/joint procedures}}\n{{Muscle/soft tissue procedures}}\n{{Breast procedures}}\n{{Skin and subcutaneous tissue procedures}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Surgery|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the medical specialty}}\n{{short description|Use of incisive instruments on a person to investigate or treat a medical condition}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{multiple image |direction=vertical|align=right|footer=Surgeons conducting Operations\n |image1=Cardiac surgery operating room.jpg\n |image2=Surgeons at Work.jpg}}\n\n'''Surgery'''{{efn|From the {{lang-el|\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} ''cheirourgik\u0113'' (composed of \u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1, \"hand\", and \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, \"work\"), via {{lang-la|chirurgiae}}, meaning \"hand work\".}} is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a person to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas.\n\nThe act of performing surgery may be called a '''surgical procedure''', '''operation''', or simply \"surgery\". In this context, the verb \"operate\" means to perform surgery. The adjective '''surgical''' means pertaining to surgery; e.g. [[surgical instrument]]s or [[surgical nurse]]. The person or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. A [[surgeon]] is a person who practices surgery and a [[surgeon's assistant]] is a person who practices surgical assistance. A [[surgical team]] is made up of surgeon, [[surgeon's assistant]], anaesthetist, circulating nurse and [[surgical technologist]]. Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term \"surgery\" can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a [[Doctor's office|physician]],<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doctors-surgery|title=Doctor's surgery|dictionary=Collins English Dictionary|access-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210062151/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doctors-surgery|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[dentist]], or [[veterinarian]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nSurgery is a invasive technique with the fundamental principle of physical intervention on organs/organ systems/tissues for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons.\n\nAs a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a person's tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound.  Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as [[angioplasty]] or [[endoscopy]], may be considered surgery if they involve \"common\" surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, [[anesthesia]], [[antiseptic]] conditions, typical [[surgical instruments]], and [[suturing]] or [[Surgical staple|stapling]].  All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called \"noninvasive surgery\" usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).\n\n=== Types of surgery ===\nSurgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, the degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.\n* Based on timing: [[Elective surgery]] is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the person's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. A [[semi-elective surgery]] is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. [[Emergency medicine|Emergency surgery]] is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity.\n* Based on purpose: [[Exploratory surgery]] is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition. [[Cosmetic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|Cosmetic surgery]] is done to subjectively improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure.\n* By type of procedure: [[Amputation]] involves cutting off a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is also an example. '''Resection''' is the removal of all of an internal organ or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or code designation. '''Excision''' is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the person. '''Extirpation''' is the complete excision or surgical destruction of a body part.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/extirpation|title=extirpation|website=[[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary|accessdate=2020-02-20}}</ref> [[Replantation]] involves reattaching a severed body part. [[Reconstructive surgery]] involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. [[Organ transplant|Transplant]] surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the person undergoing surgery. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.\n* By body part: When surgery is performed on one organ system or structure, it may be classed by the organ, organ system or tissue involved. Examples include cardiac surgery (performed on the heart), gastrointestinal surgery (performed within the digestive tract and its accessory organs), and orthopedic surgery (performed on bones or muscles).\n* By degree of invasiveness of surgical procedures: [[Minimally-invasive procedures|Minimally-invasive surgery]] involves smaller outer incision (s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in [[laparoscopic surgery]] or [[angioplasty]]. By contrast, an [[open surgery|open surgical procedure]] such as a [[laparotomy]] requires a large incision to access the area of interest.\n* By equipment used: [[Laser surgery]] involves use of a [[laser]] for cutting tissue instead of a [[scalpel]] or similar surgical instruments. [[Microsurgery]] involves the use of an operating [[microscope]] for the surgeon to see small structures. [[Robotic surgery]] makes use of a surgical [[robot]], such as the [[Da Vinci Surgical System|Da Vinci]] or the [[ZEUS robotic surgical system]]s, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.\n\n===Terminology===\n{{main|List of surgical procedures}}\n* [[Excision]] surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in '''-ectomy'''.\n* Procedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in '''-otomy'''.  A surgical procedure cutting through the [[abdominal]] wall to gain access to the [[abdominal cavity]] is a [[laparotomy]].\n* [[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally invasive procedures]], involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted, end in '''-oscopy'''.  For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called [[laparoscopy]].\n* Procedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] in the body end in '''-ostomy'''.\n* Reconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in '''-oplasty'''.  ''Rhino'' is used as a prefix for \"nose\", therefore a ''[[rhinoplasty]]'' is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.\n* Repair of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in '''-rraphy'''.\n* Reoperation (return to the operating room) refers to a return to the operating theater after an initial surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care best treated surgically. Reasons for reoperation include persistent bleeding after surgery, development of or persistence of infection.\n\n== Description of surgical procedure ==\n=== Location ===\n[[Inpatient]] surgery is performed in a hospital, and the person undergoing surgery stays at least one night in the hospital after the surgery.

All surgical instruments must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if, it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire ([[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]], a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.\n\n=== Preoperative care ===\n{{main|Preoperative care}}\nPrior to surgery, the person is given a [[medical examination]], receives certain pre-operative tests, and their [[physical fitness|physical status]] is rated according to the [[ASA physical status classification system]]. If these results are satisfactory, the person requiring surgery signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an [[autologous]] [[blood donation]] may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the [[digestive system]], the person requiring surgery may be instructed to perform a [[Whole bowel irrigation|bowel prep]] by drinking a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]] the night before the procedure. People preparing for surgery are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an [[Nil per os|NPO order]] after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the person vomits during or after the procedure.\n\nSome medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly.<ref name=\"ACRfive\">{{Cite journal |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |title = Five Things

If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The person is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific [[Surgical Positions|surgical position]], then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an \"ether screen\", which separates the [[anesthetist]]/[[anesthesiologist]]'s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Shirley|title=Minor Surgical Procedures for Nurses and Allied Healthcare Professionals|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-470-01990-0|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EaDbhAO3kS8C&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q=osman&f=false}}</ref>\n\n[[Anesthesia]] is administered to prevent [[pain]] from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing.  Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided [[local anesthesia|locally]] or as [[general anesthesia]].  [[Spinal anesthesia]] may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable.  With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the person can remain conscious or minimally sedated.  In contrast, general anesthesia renders the person unconscious and paralyzed during surgery.  The person is [[intubation|intubated]] and is placed on a [[mechanical ventilator]], and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents.\nChoice of surgical method and [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] technique aims to reduce the risk of complications, shorten the time needed for recovery and minimise the [[surgical stress]] response.\n\n===Intraoperative phase===\nThe intraoperative phase begins when the surgery subject is received in the surgical area (such as the [[operating theater]] or surgical [[Hospital#Departments_or_wards|department]]), and lasts until the subject is transferred to a recovery area (such as a [[post-anesthesia care unit]]).<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=Qogt_LvTi-sC&pg=PA2 Page 2] in: {{cite book | last=Spry | first=Cynthia | title=Essentials of perioperative nursing | publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers | location=Sudbury, Mass | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-7637-5881-3 | oclc=227920274 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAn incision is made to access the surgical site.  [[Blood vessel]]s may be clamped or [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open.  The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum.  In certain cases, [[bone]] may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the [[human skull|skull]] for [[brain]] surgery or cutting the [[Human sternum|sternum]] for [[Thoracic surgery|thoracic (chest) surgery]] to open up the [[rib cage]]. Whilst in surgery [[Asepsis|aseptic technique]] is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the person's body that will be operated on. Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.\n\nWork to correct the problem in body then proceeds.

An example is [[Vascular bypass|bypass surgery]], where clogged blood vessels are bypassed with a graft from another part of the body.  Alternatively, grafts may be from other persons, cadavers, or animals.\n* insertion of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] parts when needed.  Pins or screws to set and hold bones may be used.

When the person is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home.  During the post-operative period, the person's general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficiency and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity [[hypoventilation]] syndrome, [[atelectasis]] and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Doyle S.L. |author2=Lysaght J. |author3=Reynolds J.V. | year = 2010 | title = Obesity and post-operative complications in patients undergoing non-bariatric surgery | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 12| pages = 875\u201386 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00700.x|pmid=20025695 }}</ref> If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.\n\nIt is not uncommon for surgical drains (see [[Drain (surgery)]]) to be required to remove blood or fluid from the surgical wound during recovery.

In the 12th century, [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius Salernitanus]] composed his ''Chirurgia'', laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. [[Barber surgeon|Barber-surgeons]] generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sven Med Tidskr. |title=From barber to surgeon \u2013 the process of professionalization |year=2007 |pmid=18548946 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201387 |journal=Svensk Medicinhistorisk Tidskrift}}</ref> Basic surgical principles for asepsis etc., are known as [[Halsteads principles]].\n\nThere were some important advances to the art of surgery during this period. The professor of anatomy at the [[University of Padua]], [[Andreas Vesalius]], was a pivotal figure in the [[Renaissance]] transition from classical medicine and anatomy based on the works of [[Galen]], to an empirical approach of 'hands-on' dissection. In his anatomic treaties ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', he exposed the many anatomical errors in Galen and advocated that all surgeons should train by engaging in practical dissections themselves.\n\nThe second figure of importance in this era was [[Ambroise Par\u00e9]] (sometimes spelled \"Ambrose\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levine JM |title=Historical notes on pressure ulcers: the cure of Ambrose Par\u00e9 |journal=Decubitus |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=23\u201324, 26 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1558689 }}</ref>), a French army surgeon from the 1530s until his death in 1590. The practice for cauterizing gunshot wounds on the battlefield had been to use boiling oil; an extremely dangerous and painful procedure. Par\u00e9 began to employ a less irritating emollient, made of [[egg yolk]], [[rose oil]] and [[turpentine]]. He also described more efficient techniques for the effective [[ligature (medicine)|ligation]] of the [[blood vessel]]s during an [[amputation]].\n\n===Modern surgery===\nThe discipline of surgery was put on a sound, scientific footing during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe. An important figure in this regard was the Scottish surgical scientist, [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], generally regarded as the father of modern scientific surgery.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BFAsAAAAYAAJ|title=The Knife Man: The Extraordinary Life and Times of John Hunter, Father of Modern Surgery|author=Moore, Wendy|year=2005|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|accessdate=7 February 2013|isbn=978-0-7679-1652-3}}</ref> He brought an [[empiricism|empirical]] and [[experiment]]al approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others, he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the truth of the matter. To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans.\n\nHe greatly advanced knowledge of [[venereal disease]] and introduced many new techniques of surgery, including new methods for repairing damage to the [[Achilles tendon]] and a more effective method for applying ligature of the [[arteries]] in case of an [[aneurysm]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.uthscsa.edu/2010/12/john-hunter-%E2%80%9Cthe-father-of-scientific-surgery%E2%80%9D-resources-from-the-collection-of-the-p-i-nixon-library/ |title=John Hunter: \"the father of scientific surgery\": Resources from the collection of the P.I.

[[Astley Paston Cooper]] (1768\u20131841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and [[James Syme]] (1799\u20131870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the [[ankle joint]] and successfully carried out the first [[Hemipelvectomy|hip disarticulation]].\n\nModern [[pain]] control through [[anesthesia]] was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of [[anesthesia]], surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient [[suffering]].  This also meant that operations were largely restricted to [[amputation]]s and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as [[diethyl ether|ether]], first used by the American surgeon [[Crawford Long]], and [[chloroform]], discovered by Scottish obstetrician [[James Young Simpson]] and later pioneered by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], physician to [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=H.

In addition, the discovery of [[muscle relaxant]]s such as [[curare]] allowed for safer applications.\n\n====Infection and antisepsis====\nUnfortunately, the introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections.  The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] doctor [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths; however, the [[Royal Society]] dismissed his advice.\n[[File:Joseph Lister2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], pioneer of [[Antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]]]]\nUntil the pioneering work of British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see \"[[Miasma theory of disease|miasma]]\") was responsible for [[infections]] in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient's [[wound]]s were not available.<ref name=\"storyof medicine\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKkCwqDEI9QC&pg=PA420&lpg=PA420&dq=%22good+old+surgical+stink%22#v=onepage&q=%22good%20old%20surgical%20stink%22&f=false | title=The Story of Medicine | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | author=Robinson, Victor | page=420| isbn=978-1-4191-5431-7 |year=2005 }}</ref> Lister became aware of the work of French [[chemist]] [[Louis Pasteur]], who showed that rotting and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] could occur under [[Anaerobic infection|anaerobic conditions]] if [[micro-organisms]] were present.  Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the [[micro-organisms]] responsible for [[gangrene]]: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to [[solution|chemical solutions]]. Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop [[antiseptic]] techniques for wounds.  As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying [[carbolic acid]] on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in ''[[The Lancet]]''.<ref>''The Lancet'', \"On a new method of treating compound fracture, abscess, etc.: with observation on the conditions of suppuration\".<br>Five articles running from:<br>Volume 89, Issue 2272, 16 March 1867, pp. 326\u201329 (Originally published as Volume 1, Issue 2272)<br>\nto:<br>Volume 90, Issue 2291, 27 July 1867, pp. 95\u201396 Originally published as Volume 2, Issue 2291</ref> Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin, on the ''[[Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery]]'', which was reprinted in ''The British Medical Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2310614|volume=2|issue=351|pages=245\u201360|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=21 September 1867|title=On the Antiseptic Principle in the Practice of Surgery|pmid=20744875|author=Lister J|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.351.246}}.

This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister introduced the Steam Steriliser to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. These three crucial advances \u2013 the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment \u2013 laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.\n\nThe use of [[X-rays]] as an important medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German [[physics|physicist]] [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]]. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated [[photographic plate]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Acquapendente - Operationes chirurgicae, 1685 - 2984755.tif|[[Hieronymus Fabricius]], ''Operationes chirurgicae'', 1685\nFile:John Syng Dorsey.jpg|John Syng Dorsey wrote the first American textbook on surgery\nFile:1753 Traversi Operation anagoria.JPG| An operation in 1753, painted by [[Gaspare Traversi]].\n</gallery>\n\n== Surgical specialties ==\n<!--[[Surgical specialties]], [[Surgery specialties]] and [[Specialties in surgery]] redirect here-->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[General surgery]]\n*: {{hlist <!--Alphabetical by linkname:--> }}\n<!--Alphabetical:-->\n* [[Breast surgery|Breast]]\n* [[Cardiothoracic surgery|Cardiothoracic]]\n* [[Colorectal surgery|Colorectal]]\n* [[Craniofacial surgery]]\n* [[Dental surgery]]\n* [[Endocrine surgery|Endocrine]]\n* [[Gynaecology]]\n* [[Neurosurgery]]\n* [[Ophthalmology]]\n* [[Surgical oncology|Oncological]]\n* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n* [[Organ transplantation|Transplant]]\n* [[Orthopaedic surgery]]\n* [[Otolaryngology]]\n* [[Pediatric surgery|Paediatric (Pediatric)]]\n* [[Plastic surgery|Plastic]]\n* [[Podiatric surgery]]\n* [[Skin surgery|Skin]]\n* [[Trauma surgery|Trauma]]\n* [[Urology]]\n* [[Vascular surgery|Vascular]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==National societies==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[American College of Surgeons]]\n* [[American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons]]\n* [[American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons]]\n* [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]\n* [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]]\n* [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]]\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]\n* [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]]\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{div col |colwidth = 22em }}\n* [[Anesthesia]]\n* [[ASA physical status classification system]]\n* [[Biomaterial]]\n* [[Cardiac surgery]]\n* [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT; for [[outpatient]] surgical procedures [[medical coding]])\n* [[Drain (surgery)|Surgical drain]]\n* [[Endoscopy]]\n* [[Fluorescence image-guided surgery]]\n* [[Hypnosurgery]]\n* [[Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project]] (HCUP) \u2013 a family of health care databases etc. from the US\n* [[ICD-10-PCS]] ([[International Classification of Diseases]], 10th edition, Procedural Coding System; [[inpatient]] surgical procedures medical coding)\n* [[Jet ventilation]]\n* [[List of surgical procedures]]\n* [[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally invasive procedure]]\n* [[Operative report]]\n* [[Perioperative mortality]]\n* [[Remote surgery]]\n* [[Robotic surgery]]\n* [[Surgeon's assistant]]\n* [[Surgical Outcomes Analysis and Research]]\n* [[Surgical Sieve]]\n* [[Trauma surgery]]\n* [[Reconstructive surgery]]\n* [[Rheumasurgery]]\n* [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sister project links}}\n{{Medicine}}\n{{Neurosurgical procedures}}\n{{Endocrine system operations and other procedures}}\n{{Eye surgery}}\n{{Operations and other procedures on the ear}}\n{{Operations and other procedures on the nose, mouth, and pharynx}}\n{{Respiratory system surgeries and other procedures}}\n{{Cardiac surgery}}\n{{Vascular surgery procedures}}\n{{Operations and other procedures of the hemic and lymphatic system}}\n{{Digestive system surgical procedures}}\n{{Urologic surgical and other procedures}}\n{{Genital surgical and other procedures}}\n{{Obstetrical procedures}}\n{{Bone/joint procedures}}\n{{Muscle/soft tissue procedures}}\n{{Breast procedures}}\n{{Skin and subcutaneous tissue procedures}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Surgery|*]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}
