Ghana|Methodist Church]] in 1876 to foster intellectual, moral, and spiritual growth on the then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. Its founding name was '''Wesleyan High School''' and the first headmaster was James Picot, a French scholar, who was only 18 years old on his appointment.\n\nMfantsipim is nicknamed \"THE SCHOOL\" by its old boys for the fact that several other schools in Ghana such as [[Prempeh College]]<ref>\n[https://content.ghanagrio.com/article/378-mfantsipim-school.html \"Mfantsipim School\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128132522/https://content.ghanagrio.com/article/378-mfantsipim-school.html |date=28 January 2018 }} , ''Ghana Nation'', 13 March 2017.\n</ref> were born out of it, as these schools were started with students from Mfantsipim.\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea of establishing a collegiate school to raise educational standards in the Gold Coast was first mooted in 1865 but was not realized until 1876 when the Wesleyan High School was established in Cape Coast with donations from local businessmen and the support of the Methodist Missionary Society in London.\n\nThe school was established to train teachers and began with 17 pupils. It was originally planned to be sited in Accra because the British Government had, by 1870, decided to move the capital of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] from Cape Coast to Accra. However, local agitation and the urgent need to put the idea into practice after eleven years of debate pressurised the government to allow the school to begin functioning, but on the understanding that it would later be moved to Accra, though no such move ever took place.\n\nThe founding name of Mfantsipim was ''Wesleyan High School'' and it was established on 3 April 1876. In 1905 a graduate of the school, [John Mensah Sarbah], founded a rival school named Mfantsipim; the name derives from \"Mfantsefo-apem\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Meaning of 'Mfantsipim' |url=http://africaschoolsonline.com/user/mfantsiedu-gh |website=AfricaSchoolsOnline |accessdate=14 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615222947/http://africaschoolsonline.com/user/mfantsiedu-gh/ |archive-date=15 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |date=7 June 2017 }}</ref> literally meaning \"thousands of [[Fante people|Fantes]]\" but actually meaning \"the gathering of hosts of scholars for change\" originally by the Fantes.

It is an all-boys boarding school with seven dormitories or houses.\n\nThe '''Reverend W. T. Balmer''' arrived at '''Mfantsipim''' in 1907<ref>{{cite web |title=Rev. W.T Balmer |url=https://mobile.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Mfantsipim-and-the-making-of-Ghana-552057 |website=Ghanaweb |accessdate=14 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614121803/https://mobile.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Mfantsipim-and-the-making-of-Ghana-552057 |archive-date=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> on a mission to inspect the states of colleges and collegiates around '''West Africa''' at the time. On his arrival at Mfantsipim it seemed, for some reason, he had to stay. To his surprise he only met eight boys in the entire school, with neither a teacher nor a headmaster, the then headmaster having left for the United Kingdom. Balmer named them the '''\"Faithful Eight\"'''. One of those boys was [[Kobina Sekyi]], who went on to become a renowned lawyer, statesman, and writer.  A monument has been erected in-between the Administration Block and the Assembly Hall to perpetuate their memory.\n\n'''Reverend R. A. Lockhart''' arrived in 1925 and laid a solid foundation for the progress of the school. \nHe built classrooms and dormitories on the Kwabotwe Hill and finally brought the school to the present site in 1931. He was also the main architect in bringing the Cambridge School Leaving Certificate Examination into the Gold Coast (now Ghana).\n\nLockhart was a robust, stronghearted and principled Irishman and was critical of [[Gordon Guggisberg]]'s administration and ideas about secondary education in the Gold Coast. Guggisberg had proposed to reduce the school to a basic institution, but Lockhart convinced local people to enroll more of their wards.\n\n{{Quote |text=In few years the people of this country will be amazed at the number of its influential citizens who owe allegiance to this school. |author=Reverend R.A Lockhart }}<ref>{{cite book |title=David Ghartey-Tagoe: A Broadcast Icon |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |pages=41 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VSNLmRNg4-oC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=this+country+will+be+amazed+at+the+number+of+its+influential+citizens+who+owe+allegiance+to+this+school |access-date=29 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614121951/https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=VSNLmRNg4-oC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=this+country+will+be+amazed+at+the+number+of+its+influential+citizens+who+owe+allegiance+to+this+school&source=bl&ots=3yzguA3hmB&sig=vXrLrpfStXCZ0v4koFEzGH2bIGI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixsJSU7dLbAhWKB8AKHeydDrQQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ |archive-date=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |isbn=9781453542071 |date=28 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nLockhart's admnistration oversaw the construction of most of the buildings and structures in the school.{{clarify|date=January 2019}} He encouraged some of the bright students of the school to become teachers, on their graduation. For example, he mentored F.L Bartels in this direction, and through this effort, Mfantsipim finally got its first ever black headmaster.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adu-Boahene |first1=A. |title=Mfantsipim and the Making of Ghana: A Centenary History |publisher=Sankofa Educational Publishers |pages=52\u20133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KPZCAQAAIAAJ|isbn=9789988763114 |date=January 1996 }}</ref>\n\nIt is said that the Reverend Lockhart was a firm believer in the spirit of the black man and his abilities thereof. Asked of Bartels in France in his later years which three headmasters besides himself, were Mfantsipim's greatest, he responded: \" I will give you only two \u2013 Balmer and Lockhart; you add the third.\"\n\n'''Dr. Francis Lodwic Bartels''', the first black headmaster of the school and also the school's very own product, came into office in 1949. He went from acting headmaster from 1942 to 1945, to becoming main headmaster, and serving for another 11 years, ending his service in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adu-Boahene |first1=A. |title=Mfantsipim and the Making of Ghana: A Centenary History |publisher=Sankofa Educational Publishers |pages=52\u20133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KPZCAQAAIAAJ|isbn=9789988763114 |date=January 1996 }}</ref>{{clarify|reason=1949 or 1945?|date=January 2019}}\n\nOne notable thing about '''Dr. Bartels''' was the close relationship he kept with the boys, encouraging them to face the world, but only with discipline. [[Kofi Annan]], former United Nations secretary general, also an alumnus of the school, recalled: \"I was one of a group of boys who sat on the floor of his office for our weekly lesson in spoken English.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Kofi Annan Recalls Memories of his High School Heamaster |url=http://modernghana.com/news/320089/anis-haffar-kofi-annan-celebrates-fl-bartels-of-mfantsipi.html |accessdate=12 June 2018 |agency=ModernGhana |publisher=ModernGhana.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144139/https://www.modernghana.com/news/320089/anis-haffar-kofi-annan-celebrates-fl-bartels-of-mfantsipi.html |archive-date=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere have been many influential products of the school who have served, not only the country and the continent of [[Africa]], but also continents outside Africa and many international bodies. Mfantsipim School has trained a large number of alumni in the field of medicine, science, engineering, education, architecture, and many other disciplines.\n\nIn 1931 the school moved to its present location on the Kwabotwe Hill in the northern part of Cape Coast on the [[Kotokoraba Market, Cape Coast, Ghana|Kotokuraba]] road. The school sometimes has been referred to as '''Kwabotwe''' or simply '''Botwe''' for the reason of it being on that hill.\n\n==Houses==\n\n'''1. Balmer-Acquaah:''' this is the first house seen from the school's main entrance. It was named after Rev. W. T. Balmer, headmaster from 1907 to 1910, and Robert Gaddiel Acquaah, the first black presiding bishop of the Methodist Church. It was the first house to be built.\n\n'''2. Pickard-Parker:''' this is located right after Balmer-Acquaah, and is a long rectangular-square structure of two storeys.\n\n'''3. Lockhart-Schweitzer:''' this is the third house seen from the entrance, and is on the left. It is not too big and shares similarities with Sarbah-Picot. L.S is noted for hosting the '''Berlin Wall''', a section of the tall wall around the school that has lots of histories.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''4. Sarbah-Picot:''' this has a similar architectural style to Lockhart-Schweitzer. It was named after [[John Mensah Sarbah|John Mensah-Sarbah]] and James Picot, the first headmaster of the school. This is a twin house of Freeman-Aggrey.\n\n'''5. Freeman-Aggrey:''' this also shares similarities with Balmer-Acquah, the underneath of both serving as a passage for vehicles entering the school. It was named after Dr. [[James Kwegyir Aggrey]] and Rev. [[Thomas Birch Freeman]], also a priest of the Methodist Church.\n\n'''6. Bartels-Sneath:''' this is the sixth house on location from the gate.\n\n'''7. Abruquah-Monney:''' this is the latest and biggest house in the school, completed around 2010.

Ghana|Methodist Church]] in 1876 to foster intellectual, moral, and spiritual growth on the then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. Its founding name was '''Wesleyan High School''' and the first headmaster was James Picot, a French scholar, who was only 18 years old on his appointment.\n\nMfantsipim is nicknamed \"THE SCHOOL\" by its old boys for the fact that several other schools in Ghana such as [[Prempeh College]]<ref>\n[https://content.ghanagrio.com/article/378-mfantsipim-school.html \"Mfantsipim School\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128132522/https://content.ghanagrio.com/article/378-mfantsipim-school.html |date=28 January 2018 }} , ''Ghana Nation'', 13 March 2017.\n</ref> were born out of it, as these schools were started with students from Mfantsipim.\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea of establishing a collegiate school to raise educational standards in the Gold Coast was first mooted in 1865 but was not realized until 1876 when the Wesleyan High School was established in Cape Coast with donations from local businessmen and the support of the Methodist Missionary Society in London.\n\nThe school was established to train teachers and began with 17 pupils. It was originally planned to be sited in Accra because the British Government had, by 1870, decided to move the capital of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] from Cape Coast to Accra. However, local agitation and the urgent need to put the idea into practice after eleven years of debate pressurised the government to allow the school to begin functioning, but on the understanding that it would later be moved to Accra, though no such move ever took place.\n\nThe founding name of Mfantsipim was ''Wesleyan High School'' and it was established on 3 April 1876. In 1905 a graduate of the school, [John Mensah Sarbah], founded a rival school named Mfantsipim; the name derives from \"Mfantsefo-apem\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Meaning of 'Mfantsipim' |url=http://africaschoolsonline.com/user/mfantsiedu-gh |website=AfricaSchoolsOnline |accessdate=14 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615222947/http://africaschoolsonline.com/user/mfantsiedu-gh/ |archive-date=15 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |date=7 June 2017 }}</ref> literally meaning \"thousands of [[Fante people|Fantes]]\" but actually meaning \"the gathering of hosts of scholars for change\" originally by the Fantes.

It is an all-boys boarding school with seven dormitories or houses.\n\nThe '''Reverend W. T. Balmer''' arrived at '''Mfantsipim''' in 1907<ref>{{cite web |title=Rev.

On his arrival at Mfantsipim it seemed, for some reason, he had to stay. To his surprise he only met eight boys in the entire school, with neither a teacher nor a headmaster, the then headmaster having left for the United Kingdom. Balmer named them the '''\"Faithful Eight\"'''. One of those boys was [[Kobina Sekyi]], who went on to become a renowned lawyer, statesman, and writer.  A monument has been erected in-between the Administration Block and the Assembly Hall to perpetuate their memory.\n\n'''Reverend R. A. Lockhart''' arrived in 1925 and laid a solid foundation for the progress of the school. \nHe built classrooms and dormitories on the Kwabotwe Hill and finally brought the school to the present site in 1931. He was also the main architect in bringing the Cambridge School Leaving Certificate Examination into the Gold Coast (now Ghana).\n\nLockhart was a robust, stronghearted and principled Irishman and was critical of [[Gordon Guggisberg]]'s administration and ideas about secondary education in the Gold Coast. Guggisberg had proposed to reduce the school to a basic institution, but Lockhart convinced local people to enroll more of their wards.\n\n{{Quote |text=In few years the people of this country will be amazed at the number of its influential citizens who owe allegiance to this school. |author=Reverend R.A Lockhart }}<ref>{{cite book |title=David Ghartey-Tagoe: A Broadcast Icon |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |pages=41 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VSNLmRNg4-oC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=this+country+will+be+amazed+at+the+number+of+its+influential+citizens+who+owe+allegiance+to+this+school |access-date=29 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614121951/https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=VSNLmRNg4-oC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=this+country+will+be+amazed+at+the+number+of+its+influential+citizens+who+owe+allegiance+to+this+school&source=bl&ots=3yzguA3hmB&sig=vXrLrpfStXCZ0v4koFEzGH2bIGI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixsJSU7dLbAhWKB8AKHeydDrQQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ |archive-date=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |isbn=9781453542071 |date=28 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nLockhart's admnistration oversaw the construction of most of the buildings and structures in the school.{{clarify|date=January 2019}} He encouraged some of the bright students of the school to become teachers, on their graduation. For example, he mentored F.L Bartels in this direction, and through this effort, Mfantsipim finally got its first ever black headmaster.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adu-Boahene |first1=A. |title=Mfantsipim and the Making of Ghana: A Centenary History |publisher=Sankofa Educational Publishers |pages=52\u20133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KPZCAQAAIAAJ|isbn=9789988763114 |date=January 1996 }}</ref>\n\nIt is said that the Reverend Lockhart was a firm believer in the spirit of the black man and his abilities thereof. Asked of Bartels in France in his later years which three headmasters besides himself, were Mfantsipim's greatest, he responded: \" I will give you only two \u2013 Balmer and Lockhart; you add the third.\"\n\n'''Dr. Francis Lodwic Bartels''', the first black headmaster of the school and also the school's very own product, came into office in 1949.

The school sometimes has been referred to as '''Kwabotwe''' or simply '''Botwe''' for the reason of it being on that hill.\n\n==Houses==\n\n'''1. Balmer-Acquaah:''' this is the first house seen from the school's main entrance. It was named after Rev. W. T. Balmer, headmaster from 1907 to 1910, and Robert Gaddiel Acquaah, the first black presiding bishop of the Methodist Church. It was the first house to be built.\n\n'''2. Pickard-Parker:''' this is located right after Balmer-Acquaah, and is a long rectangular-square structure of two storeys.\n\n'''3. Lockhart-Schweitzer:''' this is the third house seen from the entrance, and is on the left. It is not too big and shares similarities with Sarbah-Picot.

This ID verifies students and grants them access to a diverse selection of benefits and discounts around the world. With the ISIC card a student may redeem discounts for travel, accommodation, visiting cultural institutions and other various benefits. The ISIC Association also issues the International Youth Travel Card (IYTC) for non-students, and the International Teacher Identity Card (ITIC) for teachers and professors. The membership fee varies country by country.\n\nAs the card is recognized internationally, ISIC cardholders can use the card to identify themselves as a student around the world. The ISIC card is managed and administered by the ISIC Association. The objective of the ISIC Association is to help improve intercultural understanding and increase education opportunities. The ISIC card is issued in over 130 countries.\n\n==ISIC Association==\nThe ISIC Association is a non-profit membership organisation legally registered in Denmark.<ref name=p1>[[ISIC Association]], \u201c2018 Annual Report of the ISIC Association\u201d, http://www.isicassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/190425_ISIC_annual_report_2018_lr.pdf</ref> The members are the organisations that hold the exclusive rights to distribute, promote and develop the ISIC card within their territory or country. These organisations are referred to as 'ISIC Exclusive Representatives' (ER). The main organ of ISIC Association is the ISIC Board of Directors, the Exclusive Representatives (Association Members) elects up to 10 Board Members, including a Chair person. The ISIC Association and ISIC Board are governed by the rules set out by the ISIC Association Constitution and Convention.\n\nThe ISIC card is administered and managed at a global level by the ISIC Service Office d.o.o. The ISIC Service Office d.o.o is a company seated in Belgrade, Serbia. The ISIC Service Office d.o.o is wholly owned by the ISIC Association.<ref name=p1/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\t\n|-\t\n!

This atmosphere gave impetus for student organisations to form, with the aim of working together for peace and cooperation throughout the world.\nOne such student organisation, the International Student Conference (ISC) held their 3rd ISC at the Studenterforeningen's Hus in Copenhagen in 1953. It was attended by the National Unions of Students and Coordinating Secretariat of National Unions of Students (COSEC), Denmark, amongst others. The attending student organisations made the decision to establish a single international identity document valid for the perceived need of travel concessions. This is the first documented mention of the International Student Identity Card (ISIC).\nRepresentatives of the ISIC were also representatives of the International Student Travel Conference (ISTC). At the 4th ISTC conference, and following the decision made at the 3rd ISC, the Norwegian and Dutch Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC, presented a document based on a Survey of the Council of Europe. The document concluded that the formation of an international student card would be of benefit to students while travelling. They accepted responsibility to form a Travel Aids Commission and \"take the necessary steps to ensure that an International Student Identity Card be made available as soon as possible in as large a part of the world as possible\". International Student Identity Card was founded with the aim to provide students worldwide with access to student facilities, wherever they travelled. It was agreed that the real value of the card would prove that the holder was a \"bona fide\" student. The first ISIC cards were produced by the Travel Aids Commission managed by the ISTC. Fifty-six thousand cards were issued amongst 31 countries in the first year.\n\n===ISIC \u2013 from travel to the lifestyle===\nIn the 21st century, the ISIC card took on a different dimension and a new purpose. The need for a student card orientated just to travel concessions was becoming less relevant, because of the social changes such as worldwide economic decline, the introduction of low budget airlines, online flight booking and direct airline sales. Due to this decline, it was identified that the ISIC card and its main purpose must be redefined. Up until 2001, the ISIC card existed primary as a travel card and a student identity card but it was agreed that the benefit and discount aspect must be utilised and the card refocused as an everyday student lifestyle card.\n\n==Facts about ISIC==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ISIC || International Student Identity Card \n|-\n| Year launched || 1953\n|-\n| Ownership || The ISIC card is owned by the ISIC Association, a non-profit organisation. \n|-\n| Annual card sales || Annually over 4.5 million ISIC cards are issued worldwide.\n|-\n| Eligibility || Eligibility for an ISIC is restricted to bona fide students engaged in higher/tertiary education and students in full-time secondary education.\n|-\n| Minimum age requirement || 12 years old. There is no upper age limit.\n|-\n| Card validity || The card validity is usually 16 months and follows the academic year, with 4 months extra.\n|}\n\n==ISIC card distribution==\nISIC Exclusive Representatives, who have the exclusive rights to issue ISIC cards in their respective countries, make up a global distribution network for ISIC cards. The ISIC card is available in over 130 countries. In each country, the ISIC Exclusive Representative is exclusively responsible for ISIC card distribution, promotion and development, including the development and managing a portfolio of local and national benefits and discounts, and services available to the ISIC holders.<ref>[[ISIC Association]] (2018), \u201c2018 Annual Report of the ISIC Association\u201d, http://www.isicassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/190425_ISIC_annual_report_2018_lr.pdf</ref>\n\n==ISIC card today==\n\nEligibility for an ISIC card is restricted to bona fide students engaged in higher or tertiary education and students in full-time secondary education. Students must be a minimum of 12 years old to be eligible. There is no upper age limit for an ISIC card.<ref name=constitution>[[ISIC Association]] (1954) \u201cConstitution of the ISIC Association\u201d</ref>\nAn ISIC card is valid for 16 months. The validity period of an ISIC card corresponds to the academic year in the country of purchase. For example, in countries where the academic year starts in September (e.g. countries in the Northern Hemisphere), the ISIC card is generally valid from the 1st September to the 31st December the following year. In countries where the academic year begins in February (e.g. countries in the Southern Hemisphere), the ISIC card is valid from the 1st February through to the 30th May, 16 months later.<ref name=constitution/>\nThere is an advised national retail selling price for the ISIC card in each country where the card is issued. The card price in each country is determined by the value of the ISIC in the local market and the country economic development level.\n\n'''A fresh and new look for ISIC - [http://www.isicassociation.org/834-2/ Brand refresh]'''\n\nThe idea to conduct an ISIC Brand refresh originated in 2017, and was subsequently launched in May 2019.<ref>(ISIC Association) http://www.isicassociation.org/834-2/</ref> The aim of the Brand refresh was to modernise the ISIC Brand's visual identity (especially for the digital environment) and increase co-branding flexibility, and provide extra space on the ISIC card for co-brand partners.\n\n==ISIC co-branding==\n[[File:ISIC Mastercard personalised.jpg|thumb|ISIC Mastercard]]\nCo- branding represents a unique all-in-one card. There are thre types of co-branding: academic, financial and commercial. From this point of view, the ISIC card may be combined with a university identity card (or campus), bank payment cards and many other commercial partners. \n\n==Endorsement & Alliances of the ISIC==\nThe ISIC card is endorsed and supported as an official proof of student status by various organisations and institutions locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. Organisations that endorse the ISIC card include national governments, ministries of education and tourism, universities, other academic institutions and student organisations internationally.\n\n'''UNESCO Endorsement'''\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been involved in the ISIC development almost since the beginning. UNESCO joined the International Student Travel Conference in 1995 and supported the ISIC card. In 1968 UNESCO issued an official endorsement in full support of the ISIC card. UNESCO recognised the ISIC card as the only internationally accepted proof of full-time student status and a unique document encouraging cultural exchange and international understanding. A renewed Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 1993. The UNESCO logo has appeared on the ISIC card since 1993. UNESCO recognises the ISIC card as a unique document encouraging cultural exchange and international understanding.<ref>[[UNESCO]] (2004), \u201cUNESCO\u201d, p8 http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22235&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418131629/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D22235%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=2012-04-18 }}</ref>\n\n'''UNWTO Affiliate Endorsement'''\n\nSupported by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), the ISIC Association was accepted as an UNWTO Affiliate Member in August 2013. The Affiliate Membership adds to the official profile of the ISIC card and distinction in the travel industry.\n\nBritish Council and Global Study Awards\nThis exciting initiative was launched by the British Council IELTS, Studyportals and the ISIC Association in 2015.

The ISIC Award was awarded annually up until 2016.\nThrough the ISIC card the ISIC Association aims to ensure individuals who aspire to participate in higher education have the help and resources to enable them to do so. The intention of the ISIC Award was to support existing education accessibility initiatives.\nThe ISIC Award winner is nominated and selected by the ISIC card distributors worldwide. Nominees for the ISIC Award were to be a non-government organisation, institution, association, or similar organisation that are able to clearly demonstrate a commitment to making education more accessible.\nThe ISIC Award winners received a financial contribution to support the continuation of their work to increase access to education. Previous award winners include AIESEC International (2011), the International Association of Universities (IAU) (2012), the [[University of the People]] (2013), the Institute of International Education (2014), the edX (2015), and the International Student Exchange Programmes (ISEP) (2016).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.isic.org ISIC website]\n*[http://www.isicassociation.org ISIC Association website]\n\n[[Category:Identity documents]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:International education industry]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox organization\n|name         = International Student Identity Card\n|logo         =\n\n|image        = \n|size         = 200px\n|alt          =\n|caption      = Logo of ISIC\n|map          =\n|msize        =\n|malt         =\n|mcaption     =\n|abbreviation = \n|motto        = \"To make student life better\"\n|formation    = 1953\n|type         = [[Nonprofit organization]]\n|status       = Active\n|headquarters = [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]\n|region_served = over 130 countries worldwide\n|language     = English (internal communication)\n|leader_title = ISIC Association Board Chair \n|leader_name  = [[Matthew J East]]\n|main_organ   = ISIC Association Board\n|affiliations = <!-- if any -->\n|num_staff    =\n|num_volunteers = \n|budget       =\n|website      = http://www.isic.org/\n}}\nThe '''International Student Identity Card''' ('''ISIC''') is an internationally accepted proof of bona fide student status. This ID verifies students and grants them access to a diverse selection of benefits and discounts around the world. With the ISIC card a student may redeem discounts for travel, accommodation, visiting cultural institutions and other various benefits. The ISIC Association also issues the International Youth Travel Card (IYTC) for non-students, and the International Teacher Identity Card (ITIC) for teachers and professors. The membership fee varies country by country.\n\nAs the card is recognized internationally, ISIC cardholders can use the card to identify themselves as a student around the world. The ISIC card is managed and administered by the ISIC Association. The objective of the ISIC Association is to help improve intercultural understanding and increase education opportunities. The ISIC card is issued in over 130 countries.\n\n==ISIC Association==\nThe ISIC Association is a non-profit membership organisation legally registered in Denmark.<ref name=p1>[[ISIC Association]], \u201c2018 Annual Report of the ISIC Association\u201d, http://www.isicassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/190425_ISIC_annual_report_2018_lr.pdf</ref> The members are the organisations that hold the exclusive rights to distribute, promote and develop the ISIC card within their territory or country. These organisations are referred to as 'ISIC Exclusive Representatives' (ER). The main organ of ISIC Association is the ISIC Board of Directors, the Exclusive Representatives (Association Members) elects up to 10 Board Members, including a Chair person. The ISIC Association and ISIC Board are governed by the rules set out by the ISIC Association Constitution and Convention.\n\nThe ISIC card is administered and managed at a global level by the ISIC Service Office d.o.o. The ISIC Service Office d.o.o is a company seated in Belgrade, Serbia. The ISIC Service Office d.o.o is wholly owned by the ISIC Association.<ref name=p1/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\t\n|-\t\n!

This atmosphere gave impetus for student organisations to form, with the aim of working together for peace and cooperation throughout the world.\nOne such student organisation, the International Student Conference (ISC) held their 3rd ISC at the Studenterforeningen's Hus in Copenhagen in 1953. It was attended by the National Unions of Students and Coordinating Secretariat of National Unions of Students (COSEC), Denmark, amongst others. The attending student organisations made the decision to establish a single international identity document valid for the perceived need of travel concessions. This is the first documented mention of the International Student Identity Card (ISIC).\nRepresentatives of the ISIC were also representatives of the International Student Travel Conference (ISTC). At the 4th ISTC conference, and following the decision made at the 3rd ISC, the Norwegian and Dutch Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC, presented a document based on a Survey of the Council of Europe. The document concluded that the formation of an international student card would be of benefit to students while travelling. They accepted responsibility to form a Travel Aids Commission and \"take the necessary steps to ensure that an International Student Identity Card be made available as soon as possible in as large a part of the world as possible\". International Student Identity Card was founded with the aim to provide students worldwide with access to student facilities, wherever they travelled. It was agreed that the real value of the card would prove that the holder was a \"bona fide\" student. The first ISIC cards were produced by the Travel Aids Commission managed by the ISTC. Fifty-six thousand cards were issued amongst 31 countries in the first year.\n\n===ISIC \u2013 from travel to the lifestyle===\nIn the 21st century, the ISIC card took on a different dimension and a new purpose. The need for a student card orientated just to travel concessions was becoming less relevant, because of the social changes such as worldwide economic decline, the introduction of low budget airlines, online flight booking and direct airline sales. Due to this decline, it was identified that the ISIC card and its main purpose must be redefined. Up until 2001, the ISIC card existed primary as a travel card and a student identity card but it was agreed that the benefit and discount aspect must be utilised and the card refocused as an everyday student lifestyle card.\n\n==Facts about ISIC==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ISIC || International Student Identity Card \n|-\n| Year launched || 1953\n|-\n| Ownership || The ISIC card is owned by the ISIC Association, a non-profit organisation. \n|-\n| Annual card sales || Annually over 4.5 million ISIC cards are issued worldwide.\n|-\n| Eligibility || Eligibility for an ISIC is restricted to bona fide students engaged in higher/tertiary education and students in full-time secondary education.\n|-\n| Minimum age requirement || 12 years old.

The ISIC card is available in over 130 countries. In each country, the ISIC Exclusive Representative is exclusively responsible for ISIC card distribution, promotion and development, including the development and managing a portfolio of local and national benefits and discounts, and services available to the ISIC holders.<ref>[[ISIC Association]] (2018), \u201c2018 Annual Report of the ISIC Association\u201d, http://www.isicassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/190425_ISIC_annual_report_2018_lr.pdf</ref>\n\n==ISIC card today==\n\nEligibility for an ISIC card is restricted to bona fide students engaged in higher or tertiary education and students in full-time secondary education. Students must be a minimum of 12 years old to be eligible. There is no upper age limit for an ISIC card.<ref name=constitution>[[ISIC Association]] (1954) \u201cConstitution of the ISIC Association\u201d</ref>\nAn ISIC card is valid for 16 months. The validity period of an ISIC card corresponds to the academic year in the country of purchase. For example, in countries where the academic year starts in September (e.g. countries in the Northern Hemisphere), the ISIC card is generally valid from the 1st September to the 31st December the following year. In countries where the academic year begins in February (e.g. countries in the Southern Hemisphere), the ISIC card is valid from the 1st February through to the 30th May, 16 months later.<ref name=constitution/>\nThere is an advised national retail selling price for the ISIC card in each country where the card is issued. The card price in each country is determined by the value of the ISIC in the local market and the country economic development level.\n\n'''A fresh and new look for ISIC - [http://www.isicassociation.org/834-2/ Brand refresh]'''\n\nThe idea to conduct an ISIC Brand refresh originated in 2017, and was subsequently launched in May 2019.<ref>(ISIC Association) http://www.isicassociation.org/834-2/</ref> The aim of the Brand refresh was to modernise the ISIC Brand's visual identity (especially for the digital environment) and increase co-branding flexibility, and provide extra space on the ISIC card for co-brand partners.\n\n==ISIC co-branding==\n[[File:ISIC Mastercard personalised.jpg|thumb|ISIC Mastercard]]\nCo- branding represents a unique all-in-one card. There are thre types of co-branding: academic, financial and commercial. From this point of view, the ISIC card may be combined with a university identity card (or campus), bank payment cards and many other commercial partners. \n\n==Endorsement & Alliances of the ISIC==\nThe ISIC card is endorsed and supported as an official proof of student status by various organisations and institutions locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. Organisations that endorse the ISIC card include national governments, ministries of education and tourism, universities, other academic institutions and student organisations internationally.\n\n'''UNESCO Endorsement'''\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been involved in the ISIC development almost since the beginning. UNESCO joined the International Student Travel Conference in 1995 and supported the ISIC card. In 1968 UNESCO issued an official endorsement in full support of the ISIC card. UNESCO recognised the ISIC card as the only internationally accepted proof of full-time student status and a unique document encouraging cultural exchange and international understanding. A renewed Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 1993. The UNESCO logo has appeared on the ISIC card since 1993. UNESCO recognises the ISIC card as a unique document encouraging cultural exchange and international understanding.<ref>[[UNESCO]] (2004), \u201cUNESCO\u201d, p8 http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22235&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418131629/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D22235%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=2012-04-18 }}</ref>\n\n'''UNWTO Affiliate Endorsement'''\n\nSupported by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), the ISIC Association was accepted as an UNWTO Affiliate Member in August 2013. The Affiliate Membership adds to the official profile of the ISIC card and distinction in the travel industry.\n\nBritish Council and Global Study Awards\nThis exciting initiative was launched by the British Council IELTS, Studyportals and the ISIC Association in 2015. The goal of these annual awards is to encourage and support more student undertake study abroad. This award is available in all counties worldwide.

He also took 1,168&nbsp;[[wickets]] as a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]], over 800&nbsp;[[caught (cricket)|catches]] as a [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] and one [[stumping]], as a stand-in [[wicket-keeper]]. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.\n\nClose was known as a cricketing gambler; he was prepared to take risks and to court controversy throughout his career. He was serving a \"confined to barracks\" punishment during his [[National Service|military service]] when selected for his first international cricket tour to Australia in 1950, was sacked as England captain for timewasting, and later sacked by Yorkshire for his lukewarm attitude to [[one-day cricket]]. He was also accused of not giving enough support to younger Yorkshire cricketers. He attracted further criticism by touring [[apartheid]] [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and white-minority-controlled [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Rhodesia]] with private teams. As chairman of Yorkshire's cricket subcommittee he had many run-ins with the then Yorkshire captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]]. However, he continued to serve Yorkshire cricket, and in his seventies was coaching and occasionally captaining the county's Colts XI. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\">{{cite web|url=https://yorkshireccc.com/history/past-presidents |title=List Of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Presidents|publisher=Yorkshire County Cricket Club|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nClose was born into a [[working class]] family in [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], around {{convert|7|miles}} west of [[Leeds]], on 24 February 1931. His parents were Harry, a weaver, and Esther (''n\u00e9e'' Barrett). He was the second eldest of five boys and a girl. The family lived in a series of small [[council houses]] in Rawdon, [[Guiseley]] and [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]]. Growing up, Close practised cricket with his father in the houses' back gardens; Harry Close was himself a keen cricketer, who [[wicket-keeper|kept wicket]] and was a big hitter in the [[Bradford Cricket League]], although he never attained the standard of the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire county team]].{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=12\u201314}} Rawdon had cricketing pedigree: [[Hedley Verity]]\u2014an [[England cricket team|England]] international in the period before the [[Second World War]]\u2014grew up there, and the Verity family continued to live in the village.{{sfn|Waters|2014|pp=16\u201318}} At Rawdon Littlemoor Primary School, Close was taught by Grace Verity, Hedley's sister, and he was friends with two of his children, Wilfred and Douglas.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=14}}\n\nAt [[Aireborough Grammar School]], Close excelled both academically and athletically.

With the enforced break from his studies he chose to try a career as a professional sportsman; he signed a professional contract with Leeds United and having already played for the Yorkshire Colts in second eleven cricket, he joined them for winter coaching.

His performances were exceptional enough to attract the attention of England cricket captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], who wanted Close to be included in the English party to tour [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] for the [[1950\u201351 Ashes series]]. Brown consulted Close's county coach, former England bowler [[Bill Bowes]], who pleaded with Brown not to select Close, arguing that such early promotion would damage him as a player.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Bowes later described Close as having a \"tremendous ability spoilt by moments of extreme spontaneity, and of determination marred by rashness\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Brown ignored Bowes and selected Close.\n\nClose's call-up to the Australian touring party attracted considerable press interest, and a press conference was called at Catterick to give the press a chance to question him. However, his moment of glory also gave rise to controversy, when one pressman found out that Close was \"confined to barracks\" for disciplinary reasons at the time his call-up was announced: he had apparently absented himself from an army cricket match.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=28}} The pressman promised to stay silent, but a week later a clerk on the camp newspaper telephoned the ''Daily Express'' with the news. However, Close still toured, and his National Service was suspended so that he could do so.<ref name=\"CA Profile\">{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/0/344.html|title=A profile of Brian Close|last=Ward|first=John|publisher=Cricket Archive|year=2003|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nClose was the youngest player on the tour, and had little in common with the rest of the party; by the end he was not even on talking terms with most of them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} After a reasonable start, making a century on his First Class debut in Australia, Close faltered, and then became injured, with a badly pulled groin muscle. He was selected to play in the second Test, which England lost by 28&nbsp;runs. After Australia were dismissed for 194, England had collapsed to 54 for 4 when Close came in to bat, with only eight deliveries to go before the lunch interval on the second day. Misjudging the bounce on the [[Melbourne]] [[wicket#One end of the pitch|wicket]], which was somewhat different from the bounce of English wickets, he swept a ball from [[Jack Iverson]] only to get a top edge to [[Sam Loxton]], fielding behind square leg. [[E. W. Swanton]] called it the worst shot he had seen played by a first-class batsman.<ref>Swanton, E.W. (1975) ''Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946\u20131975''. Fontana/Collins. p. 80. {{ISBN|0002162369}}.</ref> The dressing room was silent when he returned. Brown, when advised that Close was a bit down and needed consolation, replied \"Let the blighter stew.

He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia for the first time in 13&nbsp;years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager.

At the end of his National Service in October 1951, he signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and tried briefly to combine playing football with his cricket for Yorkshire. This proved impossible; although Close received permission from Yorkshire captain [[Norman Yardley]] to leave the first match of the 1952 cricket season early, to play football for Arsenal, this leave was rescinded by the match manager. Close arrived late at Arsenal and was sacked.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nClose enjoyed a good 1952 season at Yorkshire, achieving another double, but played no Test cricket. He played football, for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] this time, and in doing so picked up a serious knee injury which ended his professional footballing career. It also threatened to end his cricket career\u2014Close played only two first-class matches in the 1953 cricket season.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nIn 1954 Close scored his first first-class century for Yorkshire, an undefeated 123 against the touring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistanis]]. In 1955 he scored his first county championship century. In that year he played one Test match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], and at the end of the season was only 3&nbsp;wickets short of another 1,000 runs/100 wickets double. He was in the selectors' sights again, and was picked for the tour to Pakistan in 1955/56. This was not a full England tour, and no Test matches were played. Close returned to the full England side in 1957, playing in the first two Tests against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], but did not perform well enough to secure a regular Test place.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nMeanwhile, in this period, Yorkshire had not won a single [[County Championship]]. At the beginning of 1958 a new captain, [[Ronnie Burnet]], was appointed. Burnet was 40&nbsp;years old, without first-class cricket experience, and seemed an unlikely choice to restore to Yorkshire's fortunes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It was believed by the Yorkshire committee that Burnet would inject some discipline into the Yorkshire team, but initially the appointment caused problems. Several senior players left the club; [[Johnny Wardle]], Yorkshire's top bowler and Close's preferred choice of captain, was sacked for disciplinary reasons.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n===Yorkshire as county champions===\nBurnet, aided by Close, was successful in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At the end of that season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take over.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} If Burnet resigned immediately, [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.\n\n===More controversy===\n\nDuring this period Close was called up for his seventh Test in 1961, against Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=4th Test: England v Australia at Manchester, 27 July-1 August 1961|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1961/AUS_IN_ENG/AUS_ENG_T4_27JUL-01AUG1961.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> This match, which at one point England appeared certain to win, turned to disaster, with Close bearing the main blame for England's defeat.\n\nEngland were chasing a total of 256 runs to win the match, with just under four hours left to play. Scoring rapidly, they reached 150 for 1 wicket. Then [[Ted Dexter]] and [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] got out in quick succession to Benaud, who was pitching his [[leg spin|leg breaks]] into the rough outside the right-handers' leg stump. This brought Close to the crease. May, the captain, was instructing his players to go for the runs and secure the victory. Close accordingly took a calculated risk, and chose to hit out. He took one [[six (cricket)|six]] off Benaud, but to the tenth ball he faced he played another unorthodox shot which [[Norm O'Neill|Norman O'Neill]] caught above his head with two hands. Purists were outraged, and as England collapsed to 201 all out and a 54 run defeat, Close took most of the blame, with some commentators saying that he should never play for England again.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n==Captaincy==\n\n===Yorkshire captaincy===\nAt the end of 1962, Wilson retired, and the Yorkshire committee appointed Close captain. According to Bowes: \"almost overnight it seemed that Brian Close matured\". He wrote, \"Close's field placings were as intelligent and antagonistic as any seen in the county for 25&nbsp;years\".<ref name=\"Hill\" />\n\nClose's attitude, in his own words, was that \"I've always believed that the team is more important than the individual\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and that credo stood Yorkshire in good stead. [[Ray Illingworth]] noted that when he left Yorkshire to play for  [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], the players there were surprised that, while Yorkshire were perennial Championship winners, the [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]]s of their leading batsmen tended to languish in the 20s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The answer was that Close had honed them to play the innings required at the right time: when quick runs were required, players did not play for their averages, they played for quick runs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose was recalled to the England Test squad in 1963, and played his first full series of five matches, against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> His innings in the second Test at [[Lord's]] remains his best known.<ref>{{cite web|title=2nd Test: England v West Indies at Lord's, 20\u201325 June 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T2_20-25JUN1963.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, [[Wes Hall]] and [[Charlie Griffith]], daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before body protection and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but [[Ken Barrington]] scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with [[Colin Cowdrey]] famously coming in to bat (for two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Leslie|title=Beyond the call|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152801.html|publisher=Wisden|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nClose had been dismissed going for runs to win the game, and his courage earned him many plaudits. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} His shirtless torso, black and blue with bruises where he had been hit, made the front pages of the newspapers the next day. [[Len Hutton]] wrote him a congratulatory letter on his innings, and he returned to county cricket the hero. Overall, he made over 300 runs in the series, but was not selected for the next series.\n\nClose also had immediate success as Yorkshire captain, winning the County Championship in 1963. His successes saw him named as one of the five ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1964, acknowledging his impact on the 1963 season. Close went on to captain Yorkshire to the county championship in 1966, 1967 and 1968.\n\nHe first met his wife Vivien, an air stewardess with [[BOAC]], in [[Bermuda]] whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 he told her that if she didn't agree to marry him, he would never see her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===England captaincy===\nAfter the fourth Test of their five-Test series against the West Indies in 1966, England were 3\u20130 down and had lost the series. Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, \"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match.<ref>{{cite web|title=5th Test: England v West Indies at Kennington Oval, 18\u201322 August 1966|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1966/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T5_18-22AUG1966.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from [[Tom Graveney]] and [[John Murray (cricketer)|John Murray]], and half-centuries from [[Ken Higgs]] and [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]], saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain [[Gary Sobers]], who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122&nbsp;runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch \u2013 or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.\n\nThere was no overseas tour in 1966/67, so the next game Close captained was the first Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=India in England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/IND_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Of the 16 Tests India had previously played in England, England had won 12 and drawn 4, and there were no expectations that there would be anything other than an England victory in the three-match series. But they still needed to be beaten, and England, under Close, won each game convincingly.\n\n[[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] toured England in the second half of the summer of 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan In England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> The first match of that three-Test series was a rain-affected draw. The second Test was won comfortably by England by 10 wickets. It seemed certain that Close would be selected to captain England in their 1967/68 tour to the West Indies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThen on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire at Birmingham, 16\u201318 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/ENG_LOCAL/CC/WARWICKS_YORKS_CC_16-18AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Warwickshire had been set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as unacceptable time-wasting and [[gamesmanship]]. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, [[M.J.K. Smith]], \"Bad luck, Mike, you played better than we did. But I couldn't give you the game.\" Smith appeared to accept this when he replied, \"I quite understand.\" {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nBrian Sellers, chairman of Yorkshire and the one who had berated Close in 1949 for saying \"Thank you, Billy\", then made matters worse for Close by sending an apology to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In 1967 England touring sides were still MCC sides rather than \"England\" sides, and the MCC took the opportunity to overrule the selectors who picked Close as captain. Close, whose \"temperament had been shown lacking\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} did not go to the West Indies. On the Wednesday before the third and final Test against Pakistan, he was told he had been stripped of the captaincy; the replacement captain was Colin Cowdrey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe third Test against Pakistan<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v Pakistan at Kennington Oval, 24\u201328 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/PAK_ENG_T3_24-28AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> was Close's final Test as captain. He led England to a comprehensive 8-wicket victory, winning the series 2\u20130. His record as captain was played 7, won 6, drawn 1, the best record of any Englishman who captained in more than two Tests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Last years at Yorkshire===\nIn 1969 Close played only 18 county championship games as he was plagued by a calf injury, although he did lead Yorkshire to victory in the [[one-day cricket|one-day]] [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]] for a second time, the first time being in 1965. A shoulder injury saw Close miss much of the 1970 season, and Yorkshire fell down the championship table, but once Close was fit again, they had an extraordinary run and finished fourth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nClose, however, always opposed one-day cricket, believing that it lessens players' abilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Mike Procter]] notes that when [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] played Yorkshire in the John Player 40-over League in 1970, with Yorkshire three wickets down and needing six an [[over (cricket)|over]], word came from Close in the dressing room: \"No chance of winning this one, lads \u2014 just get some batting practice.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nYorkshire had a policy of not offering contracts to its players,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but in return they would tell cricketers by the end of July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose wrote a letter to Lister apologising, and gave a copy to a Yorkshire committeeman. But the letter was never presented to the committee as a whole, which voted to sack him as the first agenda item at their next meeting. In November 1970 Close was summoned to see Sellers, and given the choice of either resigning or being sacked. To begin with, he chose to resign. Later that day, and after speaking to his legal adviser, he retracted this, leaving Yorkshire to sack him. The reason, according to Yorkshire, was Close's dislike for the new 40-over one-day cricket league that was first played in 1969 (Close thought it led to bad habits and negative play), and because Close had supposedly not brought on the younger players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Later life and career==\n===Somerset===\nAfter being sacked by Yorkshire, the 39-year-old Close received offers from many other counties, including [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. But he turned all these down, preferring to accept a non-captain's role at [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe rest from the captaincy did Close good; he went through the 1971 season without injury, and scored 1,389 runs, including a century in his first game for Somerset,<ref>{{cite web|title=Leicestershire v Somerset at Leicester, 1\u20134 May 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/LEICS_SOMERSET_CC_01-04MAY1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> and a century in the game against Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Somerset v Yorkshire at Taunton, 19\u201322 June 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/SOMERSET_YORKS_CC_19-22JUN1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> In 1972, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] for his services to [[cricket]]. Close was also promoted to Somerset captain. He soon gained the same respect and commitment from his players as he had at Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Hill\" /> He was also called up to the England one-day squad to captain them in a three-match [[One Day International]] series against Australia, which England won 2\u20131, when the regular England captain and his former Yorkshire teammate, [[Ray Illingworth]], injured his ankle in the last Test.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn 1972/73 Close led a two-match tour of the \"International Wanderers\" to [[Rhodesia]]. The next two winters he captained the [[Derrick Robins]]' XI tours to apartheid [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Robins' tours were the closest thing South Africa had to [[Test cricket|Test match]] cricket at that time, and for his efforts in the first of the tours to South Africa, Close was named as one of the four ''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Players/Overall/South_African_Cricket_Annual_Cricketers_of_the_Year.html |title=''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Somerset [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] joined the county squad, and Close's leadership and discipline helped them become great cricketers. Botham said of Close, \"There was a genuine enthusiasm for cricket which rubbed off on all those playing alongside him. You couldn't help but get excited by the game.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Final Test innings===\nIn 1976, the 45-year-old Brian Close was called up for the first three Tests in England's five-[[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976|Test series against the West Indies]],<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> who were no less ferocious than when Close was battered by them in 1963.

[[Michael Holding]], [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] and [[Wayne Daniel]], a trio of fast bowlers, pounded them for two and a half hours. It was one of the most brutal displays of fast bowling ever seen. ''Wisden'' said, \"Close and Edrich defended their wickets and themselves against fast bowling, which was frequently too wild and hostile to be acceptable\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Wisden Almanack 1977|publisher=Wisden|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153009.html|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> Close himself said, \"It must have been the worst wicket I experienced in Test cricket. The faster the West Indians bowled the worse it got because the balls broke through the surface of the wicket. They exploded and flew at you.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} With this innings of 20 runs off 108 balls in 162 minutes Close completed his Test career, under a vicious barrage, standing tall and taking the damage as he had against the West Indies at Lord's 13 years earlier.\n\nAfter that, both Close and Edrich were dropped for the fourth Test. The interval between Close's first and last Test matches was 27 years, the second-longest after [[Wilfred Rhodes]]. Only one man, [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwean]] [[John Traicos]], has since played a Test match at a greater age.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===End of first-class career===\n[[File:Azeem rafiq and brian close.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Close presenting an award for Yorkshire in 2008.]]\nBy the time he retired from county cricket at the end of the 1977 season, Close had achieved folk hero status in Somerset. He went on to play for [[Todmorden]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]]. Close also had a stint as an England selector between 1979 and 1981 and in 1984 he was elected to the Yorkshire committee. He became chairman of the cricket sub-committee, which led him into more controversy and conflict with the captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\"/>\n\nAfter his retirement from Somerset, Close continued to play at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the [[wicket-keeper]] and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but Close would have none of it \u2013 he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: \"It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=Ripe old age|publisher=Cricinfo|date=2 August 2007|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/304620.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose continued to turn out to help train Yorkshire youngsters, appearing for Yorkshire Colts XI in his seventies, sometimes captaining games and taking the short leg position without a helmet, a position he had taken so many times in the past. According to [[Imran Khan]], Close once stood his ground when fielding at short leg when a batsman played a pull shot, the ball hit him on the forehead, rebounded and was caught at cover. Khan commented: \"We are not all bullet-headed Yorkshiremen, however, and I don't recommend copying Close.\"<ref>Imran Khan's Cricket Skills, Publisher: Golden Books Publishing Company, Inc.

He was picked to play against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in July 1949, when he was 18&nbsp;years old. Close went on to play 22&nbsp;[[Test cricket|Test matches]] for England, [[captain (cricket)|captaining]] them seven times to six wins and one drawn test. Close also captained [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] to four [[county cricket|county championship]] titles \u2013 the main domestic trophy in English cricket. He later went on to captain [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], where he is widely credited with developing the county into a hard-playing team, and helping to mould [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] into the successful players they became.\n\nThroughout his cricket career, which lasted from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close was one of the most charismatic and well-known cricketers. He scored almost 35,000&nbsp;[[run (cricket)|runs]] as a [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]], including 52&nbsp;[[century (cricket)|centuries]] with a highest [[innings (cricket)|innings]] score of 198. He also took 1,168&nbsp;[[wickets]] as a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]], over 800&nbsp;[[caught (cricket)|catches]] as a [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] and one [[stumping]], as a stand-in [[wicket-keeper]]. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.\n\nClose was known as a cricketing gambler; he was prepared to take risks and to court controversy throughout his career. He was serving a \"confined to barracks\" punishment during his [[National Service|military service]] when selected for his first international cricket tour to Australia in 1950, was sacked as England captain for timewasting, and later sacked by Yorkshire for his lukewarm attitude to [[one-day cricket]]. He was also accused of not giving enough support to younger Yorkshire cricketers. He attracted further criticism by touring [[apartheid]] [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and white-minority-controlled [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Rhodesia]] with private teams. As chairman of Yorkshire's cricket subcommittee he had many run-ins with the then Yorkshire captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]]. However, he continued to serve Yorkshire cricket, and in his seventies was coaching and occasionally captaining the county's Colts XI. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\">{{cite web|url=https://yorkshireccc.com/history/past-presidents |title=List Of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Presidents|publisher=Yorkshire County Cricket Club|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nClose was born into a [[working class]] family in [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], around {{convert|7|miles}} west of [[Leeds]], on 24 February 1931. His parents were Harry, a weaver, and Esther (''n\u00e9e'' Barrett). He was the second eldest of five boys and a girl. The family lived in a series of small [[council houses]] in Rawdon, [[Guiseley]] and [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]]. Growing up, Close practised cricket with his father in the houses' back gardens; Harry Close was himself a keen cricketer, who [[wicket-keeper|kept wicket]] and was a big hitter in the [[Bradford Cricket League]], although he never attained the standard of the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire county team]].{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=12\u201314}} Rawdon had cricketing pedigree: [[Hedley Verity]]\u2014an [[England cricket team|England]] international in the period before the [[Second World War]]\u2014grew up there, and the Verity family continued to live in the village.{{sfn|Waters|2014|pp=16\u201318}} At Rawdon Littlemoor Primary School, Close was taught by Grace Verity, Hedley's sister, and he was friends with two of his children, Wilfred and Douglas.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=14}}\n\nAt [[Aireborough Grammar School]], Close excelled both academically and athletically.

His performances were exceptional enough to attract the attention of England cricket captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], who wanted Close to be included in the English party to tour [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] for the [[1950\u201351 Ashes series]]. Brown consulted Close's county coach, former England bowler [[Bill Bowes]], who pleaded with Brown not to select Close, arguing that such early promotion would damage him as a player.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Bowes later described Close as having a \"tremendous ability spoilt by moments of extreme spontaneity, and of determination marred by rashness\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Brown ignored Bowes and selected Close.\n\nClose's call-up to the Australian touring party attracted considerable press interest, and a press conference was called at Catterick to give the press a chance to question him. However, his moment of glory also gave rise to controversy, when one pressman found out that Close was \"confined to barracks\" for disciplinary reasons at the time his call-up was announced: he had apparently absented himself from an army cricket match.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=28}} The pressman promised to stay silent, but a week later a clerk on the camp newspaper telephoned the ''Daily Express'' with the news. However, Close still toured, and his National Service was suspended so that he could do so.<ref name=\"CA Profile\">{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/0/344.html|title=A profile of Brian Close|last=Ward|first=John|publisher=Cricket Archive|year=2003|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nClose was the youngest player on the tour, and had little in common with the rest of the party; by the end he was not even on talking terms with most of them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} After a reasonable start, making a century on his First Class debut in Australia, Close faltered, and then became injured, with a badly pulled groin muscle. He was selected to play in the second Test, which England lost by 28&nbsp;runs. After Australia were dismissed for 194, England had collapsed to 54 for 4 when Close came in to bat, with only eight deliveries to go before the lunch interval on the second day. Misjudging the bounce on the [[Melbourne]] [[wicket#One end of the pitch|wicket]], which was somewhat different from the bounce of English wickets, he swept a ball from [[Jack Iverson]] only to get a top edge to [[Sam Loxton]], fielding behind square leg. [[E. W. Swanton]] called it the worst shot he had seen played by a first-class batsman.<ref>Swanton, E.W. (1975) ''Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946\u20131975''.

Brown, when advised that Close was a bit down and needed consolation, replied \"Let the blighter stew.

He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia for the first time in 13&nbsp;years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager. But times were different then, and the Yorkshire stalwarts were proved right: he had been picked too early, and would never be a regular Test player.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Alan|title=Life of Brian|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/417532.html |website=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=17 February 2011|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Consolidation, 1951 to 1958===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Brian Close.jpg|150|thumb|right|Close in action.]] -->\n\nThe years between 1951 and 1958 were a period of career consolidation for Close, who achieved 1,000&nbsp;runs in a season five times.<ref name=\"FC Batting\">{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/858/f_Batting_by_Season.html|title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Brian Close|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> Immediately after the tour to Australia Close had a good season in 1951, playing for the Combined Services, including a century against the touring [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]]. At the end of his National Service in October 1951, he signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and tried briefly to combine playing football with his cricket for Yorkshire. This proved impossible; although Close received permission from Yorkshire captain [[Norman Yardley]] to leave the first match of the 1952 cricket season early, to play football for Arsenal, this leave was rescinded by the match manager. Close arrived late at Arsenal and was sacked.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nClose enjoyed a good 1952 season at Yorkshire, achieving another double, but played no Test cricket. He played football, for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] this time, and in doing so picked up a serious knee injury which ended his professional footballing career. It also threatened to end his cricket career\u2014Close played only two first-class matches in the 1953 cricket season.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nIn 1954 Close scored his first first-class century for Yorkshire, an undefeated 123 against the touring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistanis]]. In 1955 he scored his first county championship century. In that year he played one Test match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], and at the end of the season was only 3&nbsp;wickets short of another 1,000 runs/100 wickets double. He was in the selectors' sights again, and was picked for the tour to Pakistan in 1955/56. This was not a full England tour, and no Test matches were played. Close returned to the full England side in 1957, playing in the first two Tests against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], but did not perform well enough to secure a regular Test place.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nMeanwhile, in this period, Yorkshire had not won a single [[County Championship]]. At the beginning of 1958 a new captain, [[Ronnie Burnet]], was appointed. Burnet was 40&nbsp;years old, without first-class cricket experience, and seemed an unlikely choice to restore to Yorkshire's fortunes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It was believed by the Yorkshire committee that Burnet would inject some discipline into the Yorkshire team, but initially the appointment caused problems. Several senior players left the club; [[Johnny Wardle]], Yorkshire's top bowler and Close's preferred choice of captain, was sacked for disciplinary reasons.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n===Yorkshire as county champions===\nBurnet, aided by Close, was successful in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At the end of that season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take over.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} If Burnet resigned immediately, [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.\n\n===More controversy===\n\nDuring this period Close was called up for his seventh Test in 1961, against Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=4th Test: England v Australia at Manchester, 27 July-1 August 1961|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1961/AUS_IN_ENG/AUS_ENG_T4_27JUL-01AUG1961.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> This match, which at one point England appeared certain to win, turned to disaster, with Close bearing the main blame for England's defeat.\n\nEngland were chasing a total of 256 runs to win the match, with just under four hours left to play. Scoring rapidly, they reached 150 for 1 wicket. Then [[Ted Dexter]] and [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] got out in quick succession to Benaud, who was pitching his [[leg spin|leg breaks]] into the rough outside the right-handers' leg stump. This brought Close to the crease. May, the captain, was instructing his players to go for the runs and secure the victory. Close accordingly took a calculated risk, and chose to hit out. He took one [[six (cricket)|six]] off Benaud, but to the tenth ball he faced he played another unorthodox shot which [[Norm O'Neill|Norman O'Neill]] caught above his head with two hands. Purists were outraged, and as England collapsed to 201 all out and a 54 run defeat, Close took most of the blame, with some commentators saying that he should never play for England again.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n==Captaincy==\n\n===Yorkshire captaincy===\nAt the end of 1962, Wilson retired, and the Yorkshire committee appointed Close captain. According to Bowes: \"almost overnight it seemed that Brian Close matured\". He wrote, \"Close's field placings were as intelligent and antagonistic as any seen in the county for 25&nbsp;years\".<ref name=\"Hill\" />\n\nClose's attitude, in his own words, was that \"I've always believed that the team is more important than the individual\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and that credo stood Yorkshire in good stead. [[Ray Illingworth]] noted that when he left Yorkshire to play for  [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], the players there were surprised that, while Yorkshire were perennial Championship winners, the [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]]s of their leading batsmen tended to languish in the 20s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The answer was that Close had honed them to play the innings required at the right time: when quick runs were required, players did not play for their averages, they played for quick runs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose was recalled to the England Test squad in 1963, and played his first full series of five matches, against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> His innings in the second Test at [[Lord's]] remains his best known.<ref>{{cite web|title=2nd Test: England v West Indies at Lord's, 20\u201325 June 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T2_20-25JUN1963.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, [[Wes Hall]] and [[Charlie Griffith]], daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before body protection and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but [[Ken Barrington]] scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with [[Colin Cowdrey]] famously coming in to bat (for two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Leslie|title=Beyond the call|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152801.html|publisher=Wisden|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nClose had been dismissed going for runs to win the game, and his courage earned him many plaudits. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} His shirtless torso, black and blue with bruises where he had been hit, made the front pages of the newspapers the next day. [[Len Hutton]] wrote him a congratulatory letter on his innings, and he returned to county cricket the hero. Overall, he made over 300 runs in the series, but was not selected for the next series.\n\nClose also had immediate success as Yorkshire captain, winning the County Championship in 1963. His successes saw him named as one of the five ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1964, acknowledging his impact on the 1963 season. Close went on to captain Yorkshire to the county championship in 1966, 1967 and 1968.\n\nHe first met his wife Vivien, an air stewardess with [[BOAC]], in [[Bermuda]] whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 he told her that if she didn't agree to marry him, he would never see her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===England captaincy===\nAfter the fourth Test of their five-Test series against the West Indies in 1966, England were 3\u20130 down and had lost the series. Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, \"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match.<ref>{{cite web|title=5th Test: England v West Indies at Kennington Oval, 18\u201322 August 1966|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1966/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T5_18-22AUG1966.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from [[Tom Graveney]] and [[John Murray (cricketer)|John Murray]], and half-centuries from [[Ken Higgs]] and [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]], saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain [[Gary Sobers]], who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122&nbsp;runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch \u2013 or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.\n\nThere was no overseas tour in 1966/67, so the next game Close captained was the first Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=India in England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/IND_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Of the 16 Tests India had previously played in England, England had won 12 and drawn 4, and there were no expectations that there would be anything other than an England victory in the three-match series. But they still needed to be beaten, and England, under Close, won each game convincingly.\n\n[[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] toured England in the second half of the summer of 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan In England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> The first match of that three-Test series was a rain-affected draw. The second Test was won comfortably by England by 10 wickets. It seemed certain that Close would be selected to captain England in their 1967/68 tour to the West Indies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThen on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire at Birmingham, 16\u201318 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/ENG_LOCAL/CC/WARWICKS_YORKS_CC_16-18AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Warwickshire had been set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as unacceptable time-wasting and [[gamesmanship]]. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, [[M.J.K. Smith]], \"Bad luck, Mike, you played better than we did. But I couldn't give you the game.\" Smith appeared to accept this when he replied, \"I quite understand.\" {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nBrian Sellers, chairman of Yorkshire and the one who had berated Close in 1949 for saying \"Thank you, Billy\", then made matters worse for Close by sending an apology to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In 1967 England touring sides were still MCC sides rather than \"England\" sides, and the MCC took the opportunity to overrule the selectors who picked Close as captain.

On the Wednesday before the third and final Test against Pakistan, he was told he had been stripped of the captaincy; the replacement captain was Colin Cowdrey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe third Test against Pakistan<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v Pakistan at Kennington Oval, 24\u201328 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/PAK_ENG_T3_24-28AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> was Close's final Test as captain.

His record as captain was played 7, won 6, drawn 1, the best record of any Englishman who captained in more than two Tests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Last years at Yorkshire===\nIn 1969 Close played only 18 county championship games as he was plagued by a calf injury, although he did lead Yorkshire to victory in the [[one-day cricket|one-day]] [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]] for a second time, the first time being in 1965. A shoulder injury saw Close miss much of the 1970 season, and Yorkshire fell down the championship table, but once Close was fit again, they had an extraordinary run and finished fourth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nClose, however, always opposed one-day cricket, believing that it lessens players' abilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Mike Procter]] notes that when [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] played Yorkshire in the John Player 40-over League in 1970, with Yorkshire three wickets down and needing six an [[over (cricket)|over]], word came from Close in the dressing room: \"No chance of winning this one, lads \u2014 just get some batting practice.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nYorkshire had a policy of not offering contracts to its players,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but in return they would tell cricketers by the end of July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose wrote a letter to Lister apologising, and gave a copy to a Yorkshire committeeman. But the letter was never presented to the committee as a whole, which voted to sack him as the first agenda item at their next meeting. In November 1970 Close was summoned to see Sellers, and given the choice of either resigning or being sacked. To begin with, he chose to resign. Later that day, and after speaking to his legal adviser, he retracted this, leaving Yorkshire to sack him. The reason, according to Yorkshire, was Close's dislike for the new 40-over one-day cricket league that was first played in 1969 (Close thought it led to bad habits and negative play), and because Close had supposedly not brought on the younger players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Later life and career==\n===Somerset===\nAfter being sacked by Yorkshire, the 39-year-old Close received offers from many other counties, including [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. But he turned all these down, preferring to accept a non-captain's role at [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe rest from the captaincy did Close good; he went through the 1971 season without injury, and scored 1,389 runs, including a century in his first game for Somerset,<ref>{{cite web|title=Leicestershire v Somerset at Leicester, 1\u20134 May 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/LEICS_SOMERSET_CC_01-04MAY1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> and a century in the game against Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Somerset v Yorkshire at Taunton, 19\u201322 June 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/SOMERSET_YORKS_CC_19-22JUN1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> In 1972, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] for his services to [[cricket]]. Close was also promoted to Somerset captain. He soon gained the same respect and commitment from his players as he had at Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Hill\" /> He was also called up to the England one-day squad to captain them in a three-match [[One Day International]] series against Australia, which England won 2\u20131, when the regular England captain and his former Yorkshire teammate, [[Ray Illingworth]], injured his ankle in the last Test.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn 1972/73 Close led a two-match tour of the \"International Wanderers\" to [[Rhodesia]]. The next two winters he captained the [[Derrick Robins]]' XI tours to apartheid [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Robins' tours were the closest thing South Africa had to [[Test cricket|Test match]] cricket at that time, and for his efforts in the first of the tours to South Africa, Close was named as one of the four ''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Players/Overall/South_African_Cricket_Annual_Cricketers_of_the_Year.html |title=''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Somerset [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] joined the county squad, and Close's leadership and discipline helped them become great cricketers. Botham said of Close, \"There was a genuine enthusiasm for cricket which rubbed off on all those playing alongside him. You couldn't help but get excited by the game.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Final Test innings===\nIn 1976, the 45-year-old Brian Close was called up for the first three Tests in England's five-[[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976|Test series against the West Indies]],<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> who were no less ferocious than when Close was battered by them in 1963. In the second innings of the third Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v West Indies at Manchester, 8\u201313 July 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T3_08-13JUL1976.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's final Test innings, Close opened with the 39-year-old [[John Edrich]]. [[Michael Holding]], [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] and [[Wayne Daniel]], a trio of fast bowlers, pounded them for two and a half hours. It was one of the most brutal displays of fast bowling ever seen. ''Wisden'' said, \"Close and Edrich defended their wickets and themselves against fast bowling, which was frequently too wild and hostile to be acceptable\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Wisden Almanack 1977|publisher=Wisden|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153009.html|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> Close himself said, \"It must have been the worst wicket I experienced in Test cricket. The faster the West Indians bowled the worse it got because the balls broke through the surface of the wicket. They exploded and flew at you.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} With this innings of 20 runs off 108 balls in 162 minutes Close completed his Test career, under a vicious barrage, standing tall and taking the damage as he had against the West Indies at Lord's 13 years earlier.\n\nAfter that, both Close and Edrich were dropped for the fourth Test. The interval between Close's first and last Test matches was 27 years, the second-longest after [[Wilfred Rhodes]]. Only one man, [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwean]] [[John Traicos]], has since played a Test match at a greater age.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===End of first-class career===\n[[File:Azeem rafiq and brian close.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Close presenting an award for Yorkshire in 2008.]]\nBy the time he retired from county cricket at the end of the 1977 season, Close had achieved folk hero status in Somerset. He went on to play for [[Todmorden]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]]. Close also had a stint as an England selector between 1979 and 1981 and in 1984 he was elected to the Yorkshire committee. He became chairman of the cricket sub-committee, which led him into more controversy and conflict with the captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\"/>\n\nAfter his retirement from Somerset, Close continued to play at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the [[wicket-keeper]] and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but Close would have none of it \u2013 he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: \"It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=Ripe old age|publisher=Cricinfo|date=2 August 2007|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/304620.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose continued to turn out to help train Yorkshire youngsters, appearing for Yorkshire Colts XI in his seventies, sometimes captaining games and taking the short leg position without a helmet, a position he had taken so many times in the past. According to [[Imran Khan]], Close once stood his ground when fielding at short leg when a batsman played a pull shot, the ball hit him on the forehead, rebounded and was caught at cover. Khan commented: \"We are not all bullet-headed Yorkshiremen, however, and I don't recommend copying Close.\"<ref>Imran Khan's Cricket Skills, Publisher: Golden Books Publishing Company, Inc.
