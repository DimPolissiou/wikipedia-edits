It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] and won three for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]. Its score was composed by [[Wojciech Kilar]]; closing credits theme \"[[Love Song for a Vampire]]\", written and performed by [[Annie Lennox]], became an international success.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1462, [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Dracula]], a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]], returns from a [[Night Attack at T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te|victory against the Turks]] to find his wife Elisabeta committed suicide after his enemies falsely reported his death. The priest proceeds to tell him that his wife's soul is damned to [[Hell]] for committing suicide. Enraged, Dracula desecrates the chapel and renounces God, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness. He then stabs the chapel's stone cross with his sword and drinks the blood that pours out of it.\n\nIn 1897, newly qualified solicitor [[Jonathan Harker]] takes the Transylvanian [[Count Dracula]] as a client from his colleague [[Renfield]] who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisitions in London. Jonathan meets Dracula who discovers a picture of his fianc\u00e9e [[Mina Harker]] and believes that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be attacked and fed upon by his [[Brides of Dracula|brides]], while he sails to England with boxes of his native Transylvanian soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr. [[John Seward|Jack Seward]]'s insane asylum.\n\nIn London, Dracula emerges as a wolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces and rapes, then bites [[Lucy Westenra]], with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompt her former suitors [[Quincey Morris]] and Dr. Seward, along with her fianc\u00e9 [[Arthur Holmwood]] to summon Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] who recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire; he eventually discovers that the creature is Dracula. Dracula, appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. When Mina receives word from Jonathan who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Romania to marry him. In his fury, Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward and Morris forced to kill the [[undead]] Lucy the following night.\n\nAfter Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum, where he kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence. He visits Mina who is staying in Seward's quarters while the others hunt Dracula, and confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends. Confused and angry, Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers Elisabeta's previous life. At her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The hunters burst into the bedroom, and Dracula claims Mina as his bride before escaping. As Mina changes, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The hunters depart for [[Varna]] to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The hunters split up; Van Helsing and Mina travel to the [[Tihu\u021ba Pass|Borgo Pass]] and the castle, while the others try to stop the gypsies transporting the Count.\n\nAt night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. Initially, they frighten Mina, but she eventually succumbs to their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood, Van Helsing places a communion wafer on her forehead, leaving a mark. He surrounds them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides, then infiltrates the castle and decapitates them the following morning. As sunset approaches, Dracula's carriage arrives at the castle, pursued by the hunters. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues. Morris is stabbed in the back during the fight and Dracula bursts from his coffin at sunset. Jonathan slits his throat while the wounded Morris stabs him in the heart with a [[Bowie knife]]. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Holmwood tries to attack, but Van Helsing and Jonathan allow her to retreat with the Count. Morris dies of his wound, surrounded by his friends.\n\nIn the chapel where he renounced God, Dracula lies dying in an ancient demonic form. He and Mina share a kiss as the candles adorning the chapel light up and the cross repairs itself. Dracula turns back to his younger self and asks Mina to give him peace. Mina thrusts the knife through his heart and as he finally dies, the mark on her forehead disappears, as Dracula's curse is lifted. She decapitates him and gazes up at a fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to Heaven together, reunited at long last.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as  [[Count Dracula]] / [[Vlad the Impaler]]<ref name=\"http\">{{cite news|title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies. : QUICK BITES : Bet You Thought Bela Lugosi's Neck Biter Was True to Bram Stoker|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-01-26|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-26/entertainment/ca-1125_1_bram-stoker|accessdate=2010-11-22|first=Andy|last=Marx|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20101124095127/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-26/entertainment/ca-1125_1_bram-stoker|archivedate=2010-11-24}}</ref>\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Jonathan Harker]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Mina Harker]] (n\u00e9e Murray) / Elisabeta\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]] / Priest / Principal Narrator\n* [[Richard E.

Coppola also asked the set costume designers to simply bring him designs which were \"weird\". \"'Weird' became a code word for 'Let's not do formula,'\" he later recalled. \"'Give me something that either comes from the research or that comes from your own nightmares.' I gave them paintings, and I gave them drawings, and I talked to them about how I thought the imagery could work.\"<ref name=\"ET\"/><br>\nThe film's hair and makeup designer, [[Mich\u00e8le Burke]], recalls: \"Francis didn't want the typical Dracula that had already been done in Hollywood. He wanted something different; a new Dracula without the widow's peak, cape, or pale-white skin.\" Burke says she used her Catholic upbringing and angelic imagery for design inspiration, as well as the 19th-century attire created by costume designer Eiko Ishioka.<ref>https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/10/8583410/vampire-halloween-makeup-famous-characters#slide-1</ref>\n\nCoppola brought in acting coach Greta Seacat to coach Frost and Ryder for their erotic scenes as he felt uncomfortable discussing sexuality with the young actresses.<ref name=\"ET\"/> However, he did ask Oldman to speak seductively off camera to Frost while they were filming a scene in which she writhed alone in her bed in ecstasy.{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} She later classified the things Oldman said to her as \"very unrepeatable\".{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}<ref name=\"ET\"/><ref name=\"Frost\">Diamond, Jamie.

He said  that about the main reason why his younger self said yes to the role: \"It was an opportunity to work with Coppola, who I consider one of the great American directors. That was enough, really. It was my first big American movie, made on a big set with lots of costumes. For a young actor, that was a tremendous experience.\"<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bram-stokers-dracula-25-gary-oldman-return-blood-sucker-never-say-never-021153659.html</ref> Another reason why Oldman wanted to play Dracula was because he wanted to say: \"''I've crossed oceans of time to find you''\" and to him it was worth playing the role just to say that line.<ref>https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a12065/gary-oldman-quotes-0112/</ref>\n\nCoppola was insistent that he did not want to use any kind of contemporary special effects techniques such as [[computer-generated imagery]] when making the movie, instead wishing to use antiquated effects techniques from the early history of cinema, which he felt would be more appropriate given that the film's period setting coincides with the [[History of film|origin of film]]. He initially hired a standard visual effects team, but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology, Coppola disagreed and fired them, replacing them with his son [[Roman Coppola]]. As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of [[Optical printer|optical]] or computer-generated effects, but were created using [[Practical effect|on-set]] and [[In-camera effect|in-camera]] methods. For example, any sequences that would have typically required the use of [[compositing]] were instead achieved by either [[Rear projection effect|rear projection]] with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them, or through [[multiple exposure]] by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film, all the while using [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed. [[Forced perspective]]s were often employed to combine [[miniature effect]]s or [[matte painting]]s with full-sized elements, or create distorted views of reality, such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics.<ref name=\"Roman\">{{cite video|people=[[Roman Coppola]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] |title=In Camera: The Na\u00efve Visual Effects of 'Bram Stoker's Dracula |medium=[[Documentary]]|publisher=[[Columbia Pictures|AMC]]|date=2001}}</ref>\n\nCoppola said of his casting choice: \"We tried to get some kind of [[matin\u00e9e idol]] for the part of Jonathan, because it isn't such a great part.

It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] and won three for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]. Its score was composed by [[Wojciech Kilar]]; closing credits theme \"[[Love Song for a Vampire]]\", written and performed by [[Annie Lennox]], became an international success.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1462, [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Dracula]], a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]], returns from a [[Night Attack at T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te|victory against the Turks]] to find his wife Elisabeta committed suicide after his enemies falsely reported his death. The priest proceeds to tell him that his wife's soul is damned to [[Hell]] for committing suicide. Enraged, Dracula desecrates the chapel and renounces God, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness. He then stabs the chapel's stone cross with his sword and drinks the blood that pours out of it.\n\nIn 1897, newly qualified solicitor [[Jonathan Harker]] takes the Transylvanian [[Count Dracula]] as a client from his colleague [[Renfield]] who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisitions in London. Jonathan meets Dracula who discovers a picture of his fianc\u00e9e [[Mina Harker]] and believes that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be attacked and fed upon by his [[Brides of Dracula|brides]], while he sails to England with boxes of his native Transylvanian soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr. [[John Seward|Jack Seward]]'s insane asylum.\n\nIn London, Dracula emerges as a wolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces and rapes, then bites [[Lucy Westenra]], with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompt her former suitors [[Quincey Morris]] and Dr. Seward, along with her fianc\u00e9 [[Arthur Holmwood]] to summon Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] who recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire; he eventually discovers that the creature is Dracula. Dracula, appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. When Mina receives word from Jonathan who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Romania to marry him. In his fury, Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward and Morris kill the [[undead]] Lucy the following night.\n\nAfter Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum, where he kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence. He visits Mina who is staying in Seward's quarters while the others hunt Dracula, and confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends. Confused and angry, Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers Elisabeta's previous life. At her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The hunters burst into the bedroom, and Dracula claims Mina as his bride before escaping. As Mina changes, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The hunters depart for [[Varna]] to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The hunters split up; Van Helsing and Mina travel to the [[Tihu\u021ba Pass|Borgo Pass]] and the castle, while the others try to stop the gypsies transporting the Count.\n\nAt night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. Initially, they frighten Mina, but she eventually succumbs to their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood, Van Helsing places a communion wafer on her forehead, leaving a mark. He surrounds them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides, then infiltrates the castle and decapitates them the following morning. As sunset approaches, Dracula's carriage arrives at the castle, pursued by the hunters. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues. Morris is stabbed in the back during the fight and Dracula bursts from his coffin at sunset. Jonathan slits his throat while the wounded Morris stabs him in the heart with a [[Bowie knife]]. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Holmwood tries to attack, but Van Helsing and Jonathan allow her to retreat with the Count. Morris dies of his wound, surrounded by his friends.\n\nIn the chapel where he renounced God, Dracula lies dying in an ancient demonic form. He and Mina share a kiss as the candles adorning the chapel light up and the cross repairs itself. Dracula turns back to his younger self and asks Mina to give him peace. Mina thrusts the knife through his heart and as he finally dies, the mark on her forehead disappears, as Dracula's curse is lifted. She decapitates him and gazes up at a fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to Heaven together, reunited at long last.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as  [[Count Dracula]] / [[Vlad the Impaler]]<ref name=\"http\">{{cite news|title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies. : QUICK BITES : Bet You Thought Bela Lugosi's Neck Biter Was True to Bram Stoker|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-01-26|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-26/entertainment/ca-1125_1_bram-stoker|accessdate=2010-11-22|first=Andy|last=Marx|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20101124095127/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-26/entertainment/ca-1125_1_bram-stoker|archivedate=2010-11-24}}</ref>\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Jonathan Harker]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Mina Harker]] (n\u00e9e Murray) / Elisabeta\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]] / Priest / Principal Narrator\n* [[Richard E.

Coppola also asked the set costume designers to simply bring him designs which were \"weird\". \"'Weird' became a code word for 'Let's not do formula,'\" he later recalled. \"'Give me something that either comes from the research or that comes from your own nightmares.' I gave them paintings, and I gave them drawings, and I talked to them about how I thought the imagery could work.\"<ref name=\"ET\"/><br>\nThe film's hair and makeup designer, [[Mich\u00e8le Burke]], recalls: \"Francis didn't want the typical Dracula that had already been done in Hollywood. He wanted something different; a new Dracula without the widow's peak, cape, or pale-white skin.\" Burke says she used her Catholic upbringing and angelic imagery for design inspiration, as well as the 19th-century attire created by costume designer Eiko Ishioka.<ref>https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/10/8583410/vampire-halloween-makeup-famous-characters#slide-1</ref>\n\nCoppola brought in acting coach Greta Seacat to coach Frost and Ryder for their erotic scenes as he felt uncomfortable discussing sexuality with the young actresses.<ref name=\"ET\"/> However, he did ask Oldman to speak seductively off camera to Frost while they were filming a scene in which she writhed alone in her bed in ecstasy.{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} She later classified the things Oldman said to her as \"very unrepeatable\".{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}<ref name=\"ET\"/><ref name=\"Frost\">Diamond, Jamie.

He said  that about the main reason why his younger self said yes to the role: \"It was an opportunity to work with Coppola, who I consider one of the great American directors. That was enough, really. It was my first big American movie, made on a big set with lots of costumes. For a young actor, that was a tremendous experience.\"<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bram-stokers-dracula-25-gary-oldman-return-blood-sucker-never-say-never-021153659.html</ref> Another reason why Oldman wanted to play Dracula was because he wanted to say: \"''I've crossed oceans of time to find you''\" and to him it was worth playing the role just to say that line.<ref>https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a12065/gary-oldman-quotes-0112/</ref>\n\nCoppola was insistent that he did not want to use any kind of contemporary special effects techniques such as [[computer-generated imagery]] when making the movie, instead wishing to use antiquated effects techniques from the early history of cinema, which he felt would be more appropriate given that the film's period setting coincides with the [[History of film|origin of film]]. He initially hired a standard visual effects team, but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology, Coppola disagreed and fired them, replacing them with his son [[Roman Coppola]]. As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of [[Optical printer|optical]] or computer-generated effects, but were created using [[Practical effect|on-set]] and [[In-camera effect|in-camera]] methods. For example, any sequences that would have typically required the use of [[compositing]] were instead achieved by either [[Rear projection effect|rear projection]] with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them, or through [[multiple exposure]] by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film, all the while using [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed. [[Forced perspective]]s were often employed to combine [[miniature effect]]s or [[matte painting]]s with full-sized elements, or create distorted views of reality, such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics.<ref name=\"Roman\">{{cite video|people=[[Roman Coppola]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] |title=In Camera: The Na\u00efve Visual Effects of 'Bram Stoker's Dracula |medium=[[Documentary]]|publisher=[[Columbia Pictures|AMC]]|date=2001}}</ref>\n\nCoppola said of his casting choice: \"We tried to get some kind of [[matin\u00e9e idol]] for the part of Jonathan, because it isn't such a great part.
