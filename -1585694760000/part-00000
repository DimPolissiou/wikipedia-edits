Eleven new English seats were created and six were abolished, and there were over 170 major alterations to constituencies across the country.\n\n==Campaign==\n\nThe Conservatives, having recovered from their landslide election defeat in 1945, accepted most of the [[nationalisation]] that had taken place under the Attlee government, which included the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and the mixed economy.{{clarify|date=December 2015}} The campaign essentially focused on the possible future nationalisation of other sectors and industries, which was supported by the Labour Party, and opposed by the Conservatives. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] essentially viewed the struggle between the two parties on this issue as a [[class struggle]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393273.stm|title=1950: Labour majority slashed |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of the major election issues was [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|Rationing]] still in effect on petrol, confectionery and meats over five years after the end of the war. The Conservative Party promised to phase out rationing while Labour campaigned for its continuation.<ref>{{citation |first=David |last=Kynaston |authorlink=David Kynaston |year=2007 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |title=Austerity Britain, 1945\u20131951 |isbn=978-0-7475-7985-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Liberal Party fielded 475 candidates, more than at any general election since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]. Liberal Party leader [[Clement Davies]] felt that the party had been at a disadvantage at the 1945 general election when they ran fewer candidates than needed to form a government. Davies arranged for the cost of running extra candidates to be offset by the party taking out insurance with [[Lloyd's of London]] against more than fifty candidates [[Deposit (politics)|losing their deposits]].\n\nIn the event, the strategy only succeeded in causing a very marginal increase in the overall Liberal vote over the previous election (albeit it was still their best popular vote percentage since 1929); the number of votes-per-candidate declined sharply, resulting in them losing a further three seats from their already-disappointing 1945 showing. A total of 319 Liberal candidates lost their deposits, a record number{{sfn|De Groot|1993}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} until 2015, when candidates for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] lost 335 deposits at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election held in that year]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/liberal-democrats-face-soaring-fines-for-failing-to-win-enough-votes/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208092654/http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/liberal-democrats-face-soaring-fines-for-failing-to-win-enough-votes/ |archivedate=8 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | \u2193{{fsp}}\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:50.4%;\" |  '''315'''\n| style=\"background:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:47.7%;\" | '''298'''\n| style=\"color:black; background:{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:1.4%;\" | '''9'''\n| style=\"background:gray; width:0.5%;\" | '''3'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Labour'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Conservative'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''L'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''O'''</span>\n|}\n\nDespite losing 78 seats, the Labour Party won an overall majority of 5 seats, down from 146 in the previous election, while their vote share slightly declined. The Conservatives saw a resurgence in their support, gaining an additional 90 seats and saw their vote share improve by more than 4%.\n\nProminent personalities entering Parliament in this election

Eleven new English seats were created and six were abolished, and there were over 170 major alterations to constituencies across the country.\n\n==Campaign==\n\nThe Conservatives, having recovered from their landslide election defeat in 1945, accepted most of the [[nationalisation]] that had taken place under the Attlee government, which included the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and the mixed economy.{{clarify|date=December 2015}} The campaign essentially focused on the possible future nationalisation of other sectors and industries, which was supported by the Labour Party, and opposed by the Conservatives. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] essentially viewed the struggle between the two parties on this issue as a [[class struggle]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393273.stm|title=1950: Labour majority slashed |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of the major election issues was [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|Rationing]] still in effect on petrol, confectionery and meats over five years after the end of the war.

Liberal Party leader [[Clement Davies]] felt that the party had been at a disadvantage at the 1945 general election when they ran fewer candidates than needed to form a government. Davies arranged for the cost of running extra candidates to be offset by the party taking out insurance with [[Lloyd's of London]] against more than fifty candidates [[Deposit (politics)|losing their deposits]].\n\nIn the event, the strategy only succeeded in causing a very marginal increase in the overall Liberal vote over the previous election (albeit it was still their best popular vote percentage since 1929); the number of votes-per-candidate declined sharply, resulting in them losing a further three seats from their already-disappointing 1945 showing. A total of 319 Liberal candidates lost their deposits, a record number{{sfn|De Groot|1993}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} until 2015, when candidates for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] lost 335 deposits at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election held in that year]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/liberal-democrats-face-soaring-fines-for-failing-to-win-enough-votes/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208092654/http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/liberal-democrats-face-soaring-fines-for-failing-to-win-enough-votes/ |archivedate=8 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | \u2193{{fsp}}\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:50.4%;\" |  '''315'''\n| style=\"background:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:47.7%;\" | '''298'''\n| style=\"color:black; background:{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:1.4%;\" | '''9'''\n| style=\"background:gray; width:0.5%;\" | '''3'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Labour'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Conservative'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''L'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''O'''</span>\n|}\n\nDespite losing 78 seats, the Labour Party won an overall majority of 5 seats, down from 146 in the previous election, while their vote share slightly declined. The Conservatives saw a resurgence in their support, gaining an additional 90 seats and saw their vote share improve by more than 4%.\n\nProminent personalities entering Parliament in this election

{"title_page": "Miaphysitism", "text_new": "{{Oriental Orthodox sidebar|expanded=history}}\n{{Christology}}\n'''Miaphysitism''' is the [[Christology|Christological]] doctrine upheld by the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], who include the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. They have refused to accept the teaching of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) that Jesus is one \"person\" (in [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]'') in two \"natures\" (in Greek \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ''[[physis#Usage in patristic theology|physeis]]''), a divine nature and a human nature, and hold that Jesus is \"fully Divine and fully human, in one ''physis'' known as the \u201cIncarnate Word\u201d<ref>https://ukmidcopts.org/coptic/universal/</ref>.\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nMiaphysite teaching is based on [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s formula \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7, meaning \"one ''physis'' of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]] of God made flesh\" (or \"... of God the Word made flesh\").\n\nThe 451 Council of Chalcedon used ''physis'' to mean \"nature\" (as in \"divine nature\" and \"human nature\"), and defined that there was in Jesus one ''hypostasis'' (person) but two ''physeis'' (natures). It is disputed whether Cyril used ''physis'' in that sense. [[John Anthony McGuckin]] says that in Cyril's formula \"''physis'' serves as a rough semantic equivalent to ''hypostasis''\".<ref>[https://classicalchristianity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/St.-Cyril-of-Alexandria%E2%80%99s-Miaphysite-Christology-and-Chalcedonian-Dyophysitism.pdf John McGuckin, \"St. Cyril of Alexandria's Miaphysite Christology and Chalcedonian Dyophysitism: The Quest for the Phronema Patrum\", p. 38]</ref>\n\nOthers interpret the Miaphysite term ''physis'' in line with its use by the Council of Chalcedon and speak of \"Miaphysitism\" as \"[[Monophysitism]]\", a word used of all forms of denial of the Chalcedonian doctrine. However, they add that \"Miaphysitism\" is \"the more accurate term for the position held by the Syrian, Coptic and Armenian Churches\".<ref>''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity'' by Ken Parry 2009 {{ISBN|1-4443-3361-5}} page 88 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&pg=PA88]</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553), the [[ecumenical council]] that followed that of Chalcedon, accepted Cyril's phrase, but warned against misinterpreting it.<ref>[http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxp#bfj Denzinger in Latin, 429]; [http://patristica.net/denzinger/ English translation of an earlier edition, 220]</ref>\n\nThe broad term \"[[Dyophysitism]]\" covers not only the Chalcedonian teaching but also [[Nestorianism]] interpreted as meaning that Jesus is not only of two natures but is in fact two centres of attribution, and thus two persons, a view condemned by the Council of Chalcedon. Similarly, \"Monophysitism\" covers not only Oriental Orthodox teaching but also the view called [[Eutychianism]], according to which, after the union of the divine and human natures in the incarnation of the eternal Son or Word of God, he has only a single \"nature\", a synthesis of divine and human, identical with neither.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Grudem|first=Wayne A. |authorlink=Wayne A.

Coptic Metropolitan Bishoy of Damiette declared it a misnomer to call them Monophysites, for \"they always confessed the continuity of existence of the two natures in the one incarnate nature of the Word of God. Non[e] of the natures ceased to exist because of the union and the term 'Mia Physis' denoting the incarnate nature is completely different from the term 'Monophysites'.

Anglicans, together with the wider oikumene, use the accurate term 'miaphysite' to refer to the Cyrilline teaching of the family of Oriental Orthodox Churches, and furthermore call each of these Churches by their official title of 'Oriental Orthodox'. The teaching of this family confesses not a single nature but one incarnate united divine-human nature of the Word of God. To say 'a single nature' would be to imply that the human nature was absorbed in his divinity, as was taught by Eutyches.\"<ref>[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/103502/Anglican-Oriental-Orthodox-Agreed-Statement-on-Christology-Cairo-2014.pdf?year=2014 \"Agreed Statement by the Anglican-Oriental Orthodox International Commission\" (Holy Etchmiadzin, Armenia 5\u201310 November 2002.

The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] focused on the divinity of Christ as the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos or Word of God]] and thereby risked leaving his real humanity out of proper consideration (cf. [[Apollinarism]]). The stress by the [[School of Antioch]] was on the humanity of Jesus as a historical figure. To the theological rivalry between the two schools was added a certain political competitiveness between, on the one hand, Alexandria and, on the other, Antioch and Constantinople.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8OJCa6euw5gC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=catechetical&f=false Thomas P. Rausch, ''Who is Jesus?: An Introduction to Christology'' (Liturgical Press 2003), p. 153]</ref>\n\nThe condemnation of Nestorius at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 was a victory for the Alexandrian school and church, but its acceptance required a compromise, the \"Formula of Reunion\", entered into by Cyril of Alexandria and [[John of Antioch]] two years later. Cyril died in 444. Under his successor, [[Dioscurus I of Alexandria]], a Constantinopole-based [[archimandrite]] named [[Eutyches]], whose answer to questions put to him was judged heretical by Bishop [[Flavian of Constantinople]], in turn accused Flavian of heresy. The Emperor convoked a council and entrusted its presidency to Dioscurus. This [[Second Council of Ephesus]], held in 449, rehabilitated Eutyches and condemned and deposed Flavian and some other bishops. These appealed to [[Pope Leo I]], who, calling their assembly not a ''concilium'' but a ''latrocinium'', a robber council rather than a proper council, declared it null and void. The Miaphysite Churches still recognize it as valid, but outside their ranks it is not reckoned as an [[ecumenical council]].\n\nThe Council of Chalcedon was held in 451 and annulled that presided over by Dioscurus. It has not been accepted by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, who do not defend Eutyches and accept the implicit condemnation of him by the (non-ecumenical) [[Third Council of Ephesus]] held in 475.\n\nThe Council accepted by acclamation [[Leo's Tome]], the letter by [[Pope Leo I]] setting out, as he saw it, the Church's doctrine on the matter, and issued what has been called the [[Chalcedonian Definition]], of which the part that directly concerns Miaphysitism runs as follows:\n{{quote|Following, then, the holy Fathers, we all unanimously teach that our Lord Jesus Christ is to us One and the same Son, the Self-same Perfect in Godhead, the Self-same Perfect in Manhood; truly God and truly Man; the Self-same of a rational soul and body; co-essential with the Father according to the Godhead, the Self-same co-essential with us according to the Manhood; like us in all things, sin apart; before the ages begotten of the Father as to the Godhead, but in the last days, the Self-same, for us and for our salvation (born) of Mary the Virgin [[Theotokos]] as to the Manhood; One and the Same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten; acknowledged in Two Natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; the difference of the Natures being in no way removed because of the Union, but rather the properties of each Nature being preserved, and (both) concurring into One Person and One Hypostasis; not as though He was parted or divided into Two Persons, but One and the Self-same Son and Only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as from the beginning the prophets have taught concerning Him, and as the Lord Jesus Christ Himself hath taught us, and as the Symbol of the Fathers hath handed down to us.|{{cite book|editor-last=Bindley|editor-first= T. Herbert |title=The Oecumenical Documents of the Faith|publisher= Methuen |location=London|date=1899|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/MN41552ucmf_1/page/n241}}}}\n\nDissent from this definition did not at first lead to a clean break between what are now the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]]. While in the West [[Holy See|Rome]] tended to uphold steadfastly the text of Leo's Tome and of the Chalcedonian definition, the situation in the East was fluid for a century after the council, with compromise formulas imposed by the emperors and accepted by the Church and leading at times to schisms between East and West (cf. [[Acacian Schism]], [[Henotikon]], [[Monoenergism]]).\n\nThe situation then hardened into a fixed division between what are now called the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Chalcedonian Churches later divided into the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church and its Protestant derivations.\n\n== Towards a resolution of the dispute? ==\n\nIn recent decades a number of Christological agreements between Miaphysite and Chalcedonian Churches have been signed not just by theologians but by heads of Churches. They explicitly distinguish the divinity and the humanity of Christ, without necessarily using the phrase \"two natures\".\n\nOn 20 May 1973, [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] and [[Pope Paul VI]] jointly declared:\n{{Quote|We confess that our Lord and God and Saviour and King of us all, Jesus Christ, is perfect God with respect to His Divinity, perfect man with respect to His humanity. In Him His divinity is united with His humanity in a real, perfect union without mingling, without commixtion, without confusion, without alteration, without division, without separation. His divinity did not separate from His humanity for an instant, not for the twinkling of an eye. He who is God eternal and invisible became visible in the flesh, and took upon Himself the form of a servant. In Him are preserved all the properties of the divinity and all the properties of the humanity, together in a real, perfect, indivisible and inseparable union.|[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19730510_copti_en.html Common Declaration of Pope Paul VI and of the Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III]}}\n\nAt that meeting they decided to set up an official theological dialogue between the two Churches. On 12 February 1988 the commission that carried on that dialogue signed \"a common formula expressing our official agreement on Christology which was already approved by the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church on 21 June 1986\". The brief common formula was as follows:\n{{Quote|We believe that our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Incarnate-Logos, is perfect in His Divinity and perfect in His Humanity. He made His Humanity one with His Divinity without mixture nor mingling, nor confusion. His Divinity was not separated from His Humanity even for a moment or twinkling of an eye.\n\nAt the same time, we anathematize the doctrines of both Nestorius and Eutyches.|[https://www.cam.org.au/Portals/66/Resources/Documents/OrientalOrthodoxChurches/Coptic_Church_Common_formula_on_Christology_1988.pdf Mixed Commission of the Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church: Common formula on Christology]}}\n\nA \"Doctrinal Agreement on Christology\" was signed on 3 June 1990 by [[Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews I]], Catholicos of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], in which they explicitly spoke of \"natures\" in the plural:\n{{Quote|Our Lord Jesus Christ is one, perfect in his humanity and perfect in his divinity \u2013 at once consubstantial with the Father in his divinity, and consubstantial with us in his humanity. His humanity is one with his divinity \u2013 without change, without commingling, without division and without separation. In the Person of the Eternal Logos Incarnate are united and active in a real and perfect way the divine and human natures, with all their properties, faculties and operations. [...] It is this faith which we both confess. Its content is the same in both communions; in formulating that content in the course of history, however, differences have arisen, in terminology and emphasis. We are convinced that these differences are such as can co-exist in the same communion and therefore need not and should not divide us, especially when we proclaim Him to our brothers and sisters in the world in terms which they can more easily understand.|[http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/it/dialoghi/sezione-orientale/chiese-ortodosse-orientali/relazioni-bilaterali/chiesa-malankarese-siro-ortodossa/accordi/1990-doctrinal-agreement-on-christology-jp-ii-mar-baselius-marth/en.html Doctrinal Agreement on Christology approved by Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Mar Baselius Marthoma Mathews I of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, 3 June 1990]</ref>\n\nSimilar accords were signed by the head of the Catholic Church and the heads of the [http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/it/dialoghi/sezione-orientale/chiese-ortodosse-orientali/relazioni-bilaterali/patriarcato-siro-ortodosso-dantiochia-e-di-tutto-loriente--damas/dichiarazioni-comuni/1984-papa-giovanni-paolo-ii-ed-il-patriarca-siro-ortodosso-danti.html Syriac Orthodox Church] and the [http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/it/dialoghi/sezione-orientale/chiese-ortodosse-orientali/relazioni-bilaterali/chiesa-apostolica-armena/chiesa-apostolica-armena--sede-di-etchmiadzin--armenia-/dichiarazioni-comuni/1996-giovanni-paolo-ii-e-karekin-i/testo-in-inglese.html Armenian Apostolic Church].\n\nAlthough unofficial dialogue between individual theologians of the (Eastern) Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox began in 1964, official dialogue did not begin until 1985;<ref>Bishop Youssef, \"The Agreed Statements: Oriental Orthodox Responses\" in ''St Nerses's Theological Review'' (l998), pp. 55-60, as reported in [https://suscopts.org/resources/literature/161/the-agreed-statements-oriental-orthodox-responses/ Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States]</ref> but already by 1989 an agreement was reached on the Christological dogma, stating that the word ''physis'' in Cyril of Alexandria's formula referred to the ''hypostasis'' of Christ, one of the three ''hypostaseis'' or ''prosopa'' (persons) of the Trinity, who has \"become incarnate of the Holy Spirit and Blessed Virgin Mary Theotokos, and thus became man, consubstantial with us in His humanity but without sin. He is true God and true Man at the same time, perfect in his Divinity, perfect in His humanity. Because the one she bore in her womb was at the same time fully God as well as fully human we call the Blessed Virgin Theotokos. When we speak of the one composite ''hypostasis'' of our Lord Jesus Christ, we do not say that in Him, a divine ''hypostasis'' and a human ''hypostasis'' came together. It is that the one eternal ''hypostasis'' of the Second Person of the Trinity has assumed our created human nature in that act uniting it with His own uncreated divine nature, to form an inseparably and unconfusedly united real divine-human being, the natures being distinguished from each other in contemplation only.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/wccfops2.194/page/192/mode/2up/search/consubstantial+with+us Joint Commission Of The Theological Dialogue Between The Orthodox Church And The Oriental Orthodox Churches, First Agreed Statement (1989)]</ref>\n\nA second Agreed Statement was published in the following year 1990 declaring:\n{{Quote|The Orthodox agree that the Oriental Orthodox will continue to maintain their traditional Cyrillian terminology of \u201cone nature of the incarnate Logos\u201d (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7), since they acknowledge the double consubstantiality of the Logos which Eutyches denied.

They have refused to accept the teaching of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) that Jesus is one \"person\" (in [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]'') in two \"natures\" (in Greek \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ''[[physis#Usage in patristic theology|physeis]]''), a divine nature and a human nature, and hold that in Jesus there is but one ''physis''.\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nMiaphysite teaching is based on [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s formula \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7, meaning \"one ''physis'' of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]] of God made flesh\" (or \"... of God the Word made flesh\").\n\nThe 451 Council of Chalcedon used ''physis'' to mean \"nature\" (as in \"divine nature\" and \"human nature\"), and defined that there was in Jesus one ''hypostasis'' (person) but two ''physeis'' (natures). It is disputed whether Cyril used ''physis'' in that sense. [[John Anthony McGuckin]] says that in Cyril's formula \"''physis'' serves as a rough semantic equivalent to ''hypostasis''\".<ref>[https://classicalchristianity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/St.-Cyril-of-Alexandria%E2%80%99s-Miaphysite-Christology-and-Chalcedonian-Dyophysitism.pdf John McGuckin, \"St. Cyril of Alexandria's Miaphysite Christology and Chalcedonian Dyophysitism: The Quest for the Phronema Patrum\", p. 38]</ref>\n\nOthers interpret the Miaphysite term ''physis'' in line with its use by the Council of Chalcedon and speak of \"Miaphysitism\" as \"[[Monophysitism]]\", a word used of all forms of denial of the Chalcedonian doctrine. However, they add that \"Miaphysitism\" is \"the more accurate term for the position held by the Syrian, Coptic and Armenian Churches\".<ref>''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity'' by Ken Parry 2009 {{ISBN|1-4443-3361-5}} page 88 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&pg=PA88]</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553), the [[ecumenical council]] that followed that of Chalcedon, accepted Cyril's phrase, but warned against misinterpreting it.<ref>[http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxp#bfj Denzinger in Latin, 429]; [http://patristica.net/denzinger/ English translation of an earlier edition, 220]</ref>\n\nThe broad term \"[[Dyophysitism]]\" covers not only the Chalcedonian teaching but also [[Nestorianism]] interpreted as meaning that Jesus is not only of two natures but is in fact two centres of attribution, and thus two persons, a view condemned by the Council of Chalcedon. Similarly, \"Monophysitism\" covers not only Oriental Orthodox teaching but also the view called [[Eutychianism]], according to which, after the union of the divine and human natures in the incarnation of the eternal Son or Word of God, he has only a single \"nature\", a synthesis of divine and human, identical with neither.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Grudem|first=Wayne A. |authorlink=Wayne A.

Coptic Metropolitan Bishoy of Damiette declared it a misnomer to call them Monophysites, for \"they always confessed the continuity of existence of the two natures in the one incarnate nature of the Word of God. Non[e] of the natures ceased to exist because of the union and the term 'Mia Physis' denoting the incarnate nature is completely different from the term 'Monophysites'.

The teaching of this family confesses not a single nature but one incarnate united divine-human nature of the Word of God.

The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] focused on the divinity of Christ as the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos or Word of God]] and thereby risked leaving his real humanity out of proper consideration (cf. [[Apollinarism]]). The stress by the [[School of Antioch]] was on the humanity of Jesus as a historical figure. To the theological rivalry between the two schools was added a certain political competitiveness between, on the one hand, Alexandria and, on the other, Antioch and Constantinople.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8OJCa6euw5gC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=catechetical&f=false Thomas P. Rausch, ''Who is Jesus?: An Introduction to Christology'' (Liturgical Press 2003), p. 153]</ref>\n\nThe condemnation of Nestorius at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 was a victory for the Alexandrian school and church, but its acceptance required a compromise, the \"Formula of Reunion\", entered into by Cyril of Alexandria and [[John of Antioch]] two years later. Cyril died in 444. Under his successor, [[Dioscurus I of Alexandria]], a Constantinopole-based [[archimandrite]] named [[Eutyches]], whose answer to questions put to him was judged heretical by Bishop [[Flavian of Constantinople]], in turn accused Flavian of heresy. The Emperor convoked a council and entrusted its presidency to Dioscurus. This [[Second Council of Ephesus]], held in 449, rehabilitated Eutyches and condemned and deposed Flavian and some other bishops. These appealed to [[Pope Leo I]], who, calling their assembly not a ''concilium'' but a ''latrocinium'', a robber council rather than a proper council, declared it null and void. The Miaphysite Churches still recognize it as valid, but outside their ranks it is not reckoned as an [[ecumenical council]].\n\nThe Council of Chalcedon was held in 451 and annulled that presided over by Dioscurus. It has not been accepted by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, who do not defend Eutyches and accept the implicit condemnation of him by the (non-ecumenical) [[Third Council of Ephesus]] held in 475.\n\nThe Council accepted by acclamation [[Leo's Tome]], the letter by [[Pope Leo I]] setting out, as he saw it, the Church's doctrine on the matter, and issued what has been called the [[Chalcedonian Definition]], of which the part that directly concerns Miaphysitism runs as follows:\n{{quote|Following, then, the holy Fathers, we all unanimously teach that our Lord Jesus Christ is to us One and the same Son, the Self-same Perfect in Godhead, the Self-same Perfect in Manhood; truly God and truly Man; the Self-same of a rational soul and body; co-essential with the Father according to the Godhead, the Self-same co-essential with us according to the Manhood; like us in all things, sin apart; before the ages begotten of the Father as to the Godhead, but in the last days, the Self-same, for us and for our salvation (born) of Mary the Virgin [[Theotokos]] as to the Manhood; One and the Same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten; acknowledged in Two Natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; the difference of the Natures being in no way removed because of the Union, but rather the properties of each Nature being preserved, and (both) concurring into One Person and One Hypostasis; not as though He was parted or divided into Two Persons, but One and the Self-same Son and Only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as from the beginning the prophets have taught concerning Him, and as the Lord Jesus Christ Himself hath taught us, and as the Symbol of the Fathers hath handed down to us.|{{cite book|editor-last=Bindley|editor-first= T. Herbert |title=The Oecumenical Documents of the Faith|publisher= Methuen |location=London|date=1899|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/MN41552ucmf_1/page/n241}}}}\n\nDissent from this definition did not at first lead to a clean break between what are now the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]]. While in the West [[Holy See|Rome]] tended to uphold steadfastly the text of Leo's Tome and of the Chalcedonian definition, the situation in the East was fluid for a century after the council, with compromise formulas imposed by the emperors and accepted by the Church and leading at times to schisms between East and West (cf. [[Acacian Schism]], [[Henotikon]], [[Monoenergism]]).\n\nThe situation then hardened into a fixed division between what are now called the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Chalcedonian Churches later divided into the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church and its Protestant derivations.\n\n== Towards a resolution of the dispute? ==\n\nIn recent decades a number of Christological agreements between Miaphysite and Chalcedonian Churches have been signed not just by theologians but by heads of Churches. They explicitly distinguish the divinity and the humanity of Christ, without necessarily using the phrase \"two natures\".\n\nOn 20 May 1973, [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] and [[Pope Paul VI]] jointly declared:\n{{Quote|We confess that our Lord and God and Saviour and King of us all, Jesus Christ, is perfect God with respect to His Divinity, perfect man with respect to His humanity. In Him His divinity is united with His humanity in a real, perfect union without mingling, without commixtion, without confusion, without alteration, without division, without separation. His divinity did not separate from His humanity for an instant, not for the twinkling of an eye. He who is God eternal and invisible became visible in the flesh, and took upon Himself the form of a servant. In Him are preserved all the properties of the divinity and all the properties of the humanity, together in a real, perfect, indivisible and inseparable union.|[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19730510_copti_en.html Common Declaration of Pope Paul VI and of the Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III]}}\n\nAt that meeting they decided to set up an official theological dialogue between the two Churches. On 12 February 1988 the commission that carried on that dialogue signed \"a common formula expressing our official agreement on Christology which was already approved by the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church on 21 June 1986\". The brief common formula was as follows:\n{{Quote|We believe that our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Incarnate-Logos, is perfect in His Divinity and perfect in His Humanity. He made His Humanity one with His Divinity without mixture nor mingling, nor confusion. His Divinity was not separated from His Humanity even for a moment or twinkling of an eye.\n\nAt the same time, we anathematize the doctrines of both Nestorius and Eutyches.|[https://www.cam.org.au/Portals/66/Resources/Documents/OrientalOrthodoxChurches/Coptic_Church_Common_formula_on_Christology_1988.pdf Mixed Commission of the Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church: Common formula on Christology]}}\n\nA \"Doctrinal Agreement on Christology\" was signed on 3 June 1990 by [[Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews I]], Catholicos of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], in which they explicitly spoke of \"natures\" in the plural:\n{{Quote|Our Lord Jesus Christ is one, perfect in his humanity and perfect in his divinity \u2013 at once consubstantial with the Father in his divinity, and consubstantial with us in his humanity. His humanity is one with his divinity \u2013 without change, without commingling, without division and without separation. In the Person of the Eternal Logos Incarnate are united and active in a real and perfect way the divine and human natures, with all their properties, faculties and operations. [...] It is this faith which we both confess. Its content is the same in both communions; in formulating that content in the course of history, however, differences have arisen, in terminology and emphasis. We are convinced that these differences are such as can co-exist in the same communion and therefore need not and should not divide us, especially when we proclaim Him to our brothers and sisters in the world in terms which they can more easily understand.|[http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/it/dialoghi/sezione-orientale/chiese-ortodosse-orientali/relazioni-bilaterali/chiesa-malankarese-siro-ortodossa/accordi/1990-doctrinal-agreement-on-christology-jp-ii-mar-baselius-marth/en.html Doctrinal Agreement on Christology approved by Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Mar Baselius Marthoma Mathews I of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, 3 June 1990]</ref>\n\nSimilar accords were signed by the head of the Catholic Church and the heads of the [http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/it/dialoghi/sezione-orientale/chiese-ortodosse-orientali/relazioni-bilaterali/patriarcato-siro-ortodosso-dantiochia-e-di-tutto-loriente--damas/dichiarazioni-comuni/1984-papa-giovanni-paolo-ii-ed-il-patriarca-siro-ortodosso-danti.html Syriac Orthodox Church] and the [http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/it/dialoghi/sezione-orientale/chiese-ortodosse-orientali/relazioni-bilaterali/chiesa-apostolica-armena/chiesa-apostolica-armena--sede-di-etchmiadzin--armenia-/dichiarazioni-comuni/1996-giovanni-paolo-ii-e-karekin-i/testo-in-inglese.html Armenian Apostolic Church].\n\nAlthough unofficial dialogue between individual theologians of the (Eastern) Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox began in 1964, official dialogue did not begin until 1985;<ref>Bishop Youssef, \"The Agreed Statements: Oriental Orthodox Responses\" in ''St Nerses's Theological Review'' (l998), pp. 55-60, as reported in [https://suscopts.org/resources/literature/161/the-agreed-statements-oriental-orthodox-responses/ Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States]</ref> but already by 1989 an agreement was reached on the Christological dogma, stating that the word ''physis'' in Cyril of Alexandria's formula referred to the ''hypostasis'' of Christ, one of the three ''hypostaseis'' or ''prosopa'' (persons) of the Trinity, who has \"become incarnate of the Holy Spirit and Blessed Virgin Mary Theotokos, and thus became man, consubstantial with us in His humanity but without sin. He is true God and true Man at the same time, perfect in his Divinity, perfect in His humanity.

When we speak of the one composite ''hypostasis'' of our Lord Jesus Christ, we do not say that in Him, a divine ''hypostasis'' and a human ''hypostasis'' came together. It is that the one eternal ''hypostasis'' of the Second Person of the Trinity has assumed our created human nature in that act uniting it with His own uncreated divine nature, to form an inseparably and unconfusedly united real divine-human being, the natures being distinguished from each other in contemplation only.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/wccfops2.194/page/192/mode/2up/search/consubstantial+with+us Joint Commission Of The Theological Dialogue Between The Orthodox Church And The Oriental Orthodox Churches, First Agreed Statement (1989)]</ref>\n\nA second Agreed Statement was published in the following year 1990 declaring:\n{{Quote|The Orthodox agree that the Oriental Orthodox will continue to maintain their traditional Cyrillian terminology of \u201cone nature of the incarnate Logos\u201d (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7), since they acknowledge the double consubstantiality of the Logos which Eutyches denied.

The chairman of the board is elected county-wide and serves full-time. The four other commissioners are elected from single-member districts and serve part-time positions. The board hires a county administrator who oversees daily operations of the county's twelve executive departments. Gwinnett County has a police department that operates under the authority of the Board of Commissioners. Some of the local Gwinnett city budgets have recently come under increasing scrutiny of the General Funds allocated to police services. Cities such as Duluth have allocated as much as forty percent of their city budgets, reaching some of the highest levels in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.duluthga.net/departments/1budget_and_finance/docs/FY%202017%20budgetfinal.pdf|format=PDF|title=CITY OF DULUTH GEORGIA : ANNUAL BUDGET REPORT : FISCAL YEAR 2017|website=Duluthga.net|accessdate=12 July 2018}}</ref> Solutions to high spending being discussed include additional \u201cinvestment in mental health, housing, youth development and living wages would stabilize communities and prove more effective than policing.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/08/07/how-much-do-u-s-cities-spend-every-year-on-policing-infographic/#4ce45f91e7b7|title=How Much Do U.S. Cities Spend Every Year On Policing?

Members of the Board of Education are elected from special election districts in the county.\n\nFrom 1980 until 2012, the county was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections, which has since changed in recent times as the county has gotten larger and more diverse. In 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] became the first Democrat to win Gwinnett County since 1976, when Georgia native [[Jimmy Carter]] won every county in the state. In 2018, [[Stacey Abrams]] became the first Democrat to win Gwinnett County in a gubernatorial election since 1986 when [[Joe Frank Harris]] swept every county statewide.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Previous presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The chairman of the board is elected county-wide and serves full-time. The four other commissioners are elected from single-member districts and serve part-time positions. The board hires a county administrator who oversees daily operations of the county's twelve executive departments. Gwinnett County has a police department that operates under the authority of the Board of Commissioners. Some of the local Gwinnett city budgets have recently come under increasing scrutiny of the General Funds allocated to police services. Cities such as Duluth have allocated as much as forty percent of their city budgets, reaching some of the highest levels in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.duluthga.net/departments/1budget_and_finance/docs/FY%202017%20budgetfinal.pdf|format=PDF|title=CITY OF DULUTH GEORGIA : ANNUAL BUDGET REPORT : FISCAL YEAR 2017|website=Duluthga.net|accessdate=12 July 2018}}</ref> Solutions to high spending being discussed include additional \u201cinvestment in mental health, housing, youth development and living wages would stabilize communities and prove more effective than policing.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/08/07/how-much-do-u-s-cities-spend-every-year-on-policing-infographic/#4ce45f91e7b7|title=How Much Do U.S. Cities Spend Every Year On Policing?

Members of the Board of Education are elected from special election districts in the county.\n\nFrom 1980 until 2012, the county was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections, which has since changed in recent times as the county has gotten larger and more diverse. In 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] became the first Democrat to win Gwinnett County since 1976, when Georgia native [[Jimmy Carter]] won every county in the state. In 2018, [[Stacey Abrams]] became the first Democrat to win Gwinnett County in a gubernatorial election since 1986 when [[Joe Frank Harris]] swept every county statewide.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Previous presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
