In prime-boosting, one type of vaccine is followed by a boost with another type in an attempt to improve immunogenicity.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=McArthur|first1=MA|last2=Sztein|first2=MB|last3=Edelman|first3=R|title=Dengue vaccines: recent developments, ongoing challenges and current candidates.|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=August 2013|volume=12|issue=8|pages=933\u201353|pmid=23984962|doi=10.1586/14760584.2013.815412|pmc=3773977}}</ref>\n\n===V180===\n\n[[Merck & Co.|Merck]] is studying recombinant subunit vaccines expressed in [[Drosophila]] cells. {{As of|2019}}, it has completed phase I stage and V180 formulations found to be generally well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Manoff |first1= Susan B|last2= Sausser |first2= Michelle|last3= Russel|first3= Amy Flak|last4= Martin |first4= Jason|last5= Radley |first5= David|last6= Hyatt |first6= Donna |date= 3 June 2019 |title= Immunogenicity and safety of an investigational tetravalent recombinant subunit vaccine for dengue: results of a Phase I randomized clinical trial in flavivirus-na\u00efve adults |journal= Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics |volume= 15 |issue= 2019|pages= 2195\u20132204 |doi= 10.1080/21645515.2018.1546523|pmid= 30427741|pmc= 6773383}}</ref>\n\n===DNA vaccines===\n\nIn 2011, the [[Naval Medical Research Center]] attempted to develop a monovalent DNA plasmid vaccine, but early results showed it to be only moderately immunogenic.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{update inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n==History==\nIn December 2018, Dengvaxia was approved in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dengvaxia EPAR | website=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | date=23 October 2019 | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/dengvaxia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206193402/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/dengvaxia | archive-date=6 December 2019 | url-status=live | access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, Dengvaxia was approved in the United States as the first vaccine approved for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all dengue virus serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4) in people ages nine through 16 who have laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas.<ref name=FDA2019 /> Dengue is endemic in the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<ref name=FDA2019 />\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of the vaccine was determined in three randomized, placebo-controlled studies involving approximately 35,000 individuals in dengue-endemic areas, including Puerto Rico, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region.<ref name=FDA2019 /> The vaccine was determined to be approximately 76 percent effective in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed dengue disease in individuals 9 through 16 years of age who previously had laboratory-confirmed dengue disease.<ref name=FDA2019 /> Dengvaxia has already been approved in 19 countries and the European Union.<ref name=FDA2019 />\n\nDengvaxia is not approved in the U.S. for use in individuals not previously infected by any dengue virus serotype or for whom this information is unknown.<ref name=FDA2019 />\n\nDengvaxia is a live, attenuated vaccine that is administered as three separate injections, with the initial dose followed by two additional shots given six and twelve months later.<ref name=FDA2019 />\n\nThe U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) granted the application for Dengvaxia [[priority review]] designation and a tropical disease priority review voucher.<ref name=FDA2019 /> The approval of Dengvaxia was granted to Sanofi Pasteur.<ref name=FDA2019 />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/dengue_vaccines/en/ Dengue vaccine research.] [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)\n* [http://www.denguevaccines.org/ Dengue Vaccine Initiative]\n* {{MeshName|Dengue Vaccines}}\n\n{{Vaccines}}\n{{Portal bar | Medicine | Viruses}}\n\n[[Category:Dengue fever]]\n[[Category:Vaccines]]\n[[Category:World Health Organization essential medicines (vaccines)]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "Trying a different syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_vaccine"}
