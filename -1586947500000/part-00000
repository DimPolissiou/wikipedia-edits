Madaus had exclusively licensed the right to use the Regurin trademark to Speciality European Pharma Ltd. In 2009, when European patents expired on the drug, Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group, a well known parallel importer, which had been selling the drug in the UK under another label, Ceris, which was used in France, began to put stickers on their packaging with the Regurin name. Speciality and Madaus sued and initially won based on the argument that 90% of prescriptions were already generic, but Doncaster appealed and won the appeal based on the argument that it could not charge a premium with a generic label. The case has broad implications for trade in the EU.<ref name=lexology>Lexology.

Aalesund kept their spot in the Tippeligaen, beating Sogndal 4-1 away, 3-1 at home, and 7-2 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web | title = Beramming kvalikkamper til Tippeligaen | work=Football Association of Norway | url=http://www.fotball.no/t1.aspx?p=51831&x=1&a=237665 | accessdate=2008-11-04| date=2008-11-03 | language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\n==League table==\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|res_col_header=PR\n\n|team1=ODD|name_ODD=[[Odd Grenland]]\n|team2=SF|name_SF=[[Sandefjord Fotball|Sandefjord]]\n|team3=STA|name_STA=[[IK Start|Start]]\n|team4=SIL|name_SIL=[[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]]\n|team5=H\u00d8N|name_H\u00d8N=[[H\u00f8nefoss BK]]\n|team6=NOT|name_NOT=[[Notodden FK|Notodden]]\n|team7=HAU|name_HAU=[[FK Haugesund|Haugesund]]\n|team8=NIL|name_NIL=[[Nybergsund IL-Trysil|Nybergsund-Trysil]]\n|team9=MFK|name_MFK=[[Moss FK|Moss]]\n|team10=SSFK|name_SSFK=[[FK Sparta Sarpsborg|Sarpsborg Sparta]]\n|team11=BRY|name_BRY=[[Bryne FK|Bryne]]\n|team12=L\u00d8V|name_L\u00d8V=[[L\u00f8v-Ham Fotball|L\u00f8v-Ham]]\n|team13=KIL|name_KIL=[[Kongsvinger IL Toppfotball|Kongsvinger]]\n|team14=ALT|name_ALT=[[Alta IF|Alta]]\n|team15=ULF|name_ULF=[[Sandnes Ulf]]\n|team16=ILH|name_ILH=[[IL H\u00f8dd|H\u00f8dd]]\n\n|win_ODD=20|draw_ODD=5|loss_ODD=5|gf_ODD=76|ga_ODD=44|status_ODD=CP\n|win_SF=17|draw_SF=9|loss_SF=4|gf_SF=46|ga_SF=25|status_SF=P\n|win_STA=17|draw_STA=8|loss_STA=5|gf_STA=58|ga_STA=34|status_STA=P\n|win_SIL=15|draw_SIL=9|loss_SIL=6|gf_SIL=53|ga_SIL=36\n|win_H\u00d8N=15|draw_H\u00d8N=6|loss_H\u00d8N=9|gf_H\u00d8N=47|ga_H\u00d8N=33\n|win_NOT=12|draw_NOT=10|loss_NOT=8|gf_NOT=55|ga_NOT=40\n|win_HAU=11|draw_HAU=9|loss_HAU=10|gf_HAU=48|ga_HAU=47\n|win_NIL=12|draw_NIL=6|loss_NIL=12|gf_NIL=49|ga_NIL=53\n|win_MFK=9|draw_MFK=12|loss_MFK=9|gf_MFK=63|ga_MFK=54\n|win_SSFK=10|draw_SSFK=7|loss_SSFK=13|gf_SSFK=45|ga_SSFK=43\n|win_BRY=10|draw_BRY=6|loss_BRY=14|gf_BRY=38|ga_BRY=53\n|win_L\u00d8V=9|draw_L\u00d8V=7|loss_L\u00d8V=14|gf_L\u00d8V=37|ga_L\u00d8V=45\n|win_KIL=8|draw_KIL=6|loss_KIL=16|gf_KIL=33|ga_KIL=58\n|win_ALT=8|draw_ALT=2|loss_ALT=20|gf_ALT=49|ga_ALT=66\n|win_ULF=5|draw_ULF=10|loss_ULF=15|gf_ULF=36|ga_ULF=55|status_ULF=R\n|win_ILH=2|draw_ILH=8|loss_ILH=20|gf_ILH=29|ga_ILH=76|status_ILH=R\n\n|col_P=green1|text_P=Promotion to [[2009 Tippeligaen|Tippeligaen]]\n|result1=P|result2=P|result3=P\n|col_PP=green3|text_PP=Qualification for the [[2008 1. divisjon#Promotion play-offs|promotion play-offs]]\n|result4=PP\n|col_R=red1|text_R=Relegation to [[2009 2. divisjon|2. divisjon]]\n|result15=R|result16=R\n\n|class_rules=1) points; 2) goal difference; 3) number of goals scored.

During the [[Gaza War (2008\u201309)|Gaza War]] in January 2009, his three daughters and a niece were killed by Israeli tank fire directed at his home. He had been calling in reports about the effect of the war by phone to a TV station. In his regularly scheduled report, in tears, he described their killing on-air, in a video that was widely circulated in Israel and the world.<ref>{{cite media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUh6xVlndhM |title=Israeli TV airs telephone call to father after children killed -English |date=January 17, 2009 |access-date=September 14, 2019 |via=[[YouTube]] }} (English subtitles)</ref> The Israeli military initially claimed that Dr. Abuelaish's house was targeted because it was the source of sniper fire.

He now resides in [[Toronto, Canada]], with his remaining children.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nAbuelaish was born and raised in the [[Jabalia Camp|Jabalia refugee camp]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]. He received his elementary, preparatory and secondary education in the [[refugee camp]] schools.\n\nAbuelaish received a scholarship to study medicine in [[Egypt]]. After completing medical studies at [[Cairo University]] in 1983, he earned a diploma in [[Obstetrics and Gynaecology]] from the [[University of London]].<ref name=Bloomsbury>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/Authors/details.aspx?tpid=13823 ''Izzeldin Abuelaish.''

After the [[Hamas]] takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007, he was one of the few Gazans to continue entering Israel regularly. He lived in a multi-story building in Jabaliya that he and his brother had built. In 2008, his wife died of cancer, and he was left to raise their eight children.\n\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 [[Gaza War (2008\u201309)|Gaza War]], he gave reports and interviews to the Israeli media on the situation in Gaza. On January 16, 2009, a few days before the end of the war, an Israeli tank fired two shells at his home, killing three of his daughters and a niece. An Israeli military investigation of the incident concluded that fire had been directed at his house after figures spotted on the roof of the building had been suspected of being observers directing sniper fire against IDF troops. The incident occurred as he had been corresponding live with [[Channel 10 (Israeli TV channel)|Channel 10]] reporter Shlomi Eldar, and his reaction to learning of the deaths of his daughters was broadcast live to Israeli audiences.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7871122.stm</ref><ref>https://www.timesofisrael.com/court-rules-against-gaza-doctor-who-sued-over-shelling-that-killed-3-daughters/</ref>\n\nHe has written a book named ''I Shall Not Hate''.\n\nHe founded the \"Daughters for Life Foundation\" in memory of three of his daughters, who were killed by Israeli tank fire during the [[Gaza War (2008\u201309)|Gaza War]].

I felt disloved, out of space, screaming, \"What can I do?\" They were not satisfied by the first shell and to leave my eldest daughter.

He now resides in [[Toronto, Canada]], with his remaining children.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nAbuelaish was born and raised in the [[Jabalia Camp|Jabalia refugee camp]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]. He received his elementary, preparatory and secondary education in the [[refugee camp]] schools.\n\nAbuelaish received a scholarship to study medicine in [[Egypt]]. After completing medical studies at [[Cairo University]] in 1983, he earned a diploma in [[Obstetrics and Gynaecology]] from the [[University of London]].<ref name=Bloomsbury>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/Authors/details.aspx?tpid=13823 ''Izzeldin Abuelaish.''

After the [[Hamas]] takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007, he was one of the few Gazans to continue entering Israel regularly. He lived in a multi-story building in Jabaliya that he and his brother had built. In 2008, his wife died of cancer, and he was left to raise their eight children.\n\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 [[Gaza War (2008\u201309)|Gaza War]], he gave reports and interviews to the Israeli media on the situation in Gaza. On January 16, 2009, a few days before the end of the war, an Israeli tank fired two shells at his home, killing three of his daughters and a niece. An Israeli military investigation of the incident concluded that fire had been directed at his house after figures spotted on the roof of the building had been suspected of being observers directing sniper fire against IDF troops. The incident occurred as he had been corresponding live with [[Channel 10 (Israeli TV channel)|Channel 10]] reporter Shlomi Eldar, and his reaction to learning of the deaths of his daughters was broadcast live to Israeli audiences.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7871122.stm</ref><ref>https://www.timesofisrael.com/court-rules-against-gaza-doctor-who-sued-over-shelling-that-killed-3-daughters/</ref>\n\nHe has written a book named ''I Shall Not Hate''.\n\nHe founded the \"Daughters for Life Foundation\" in memory of three of his daughters, who were killed by Israeli tank fire during the [[Gaza War (2008\u201309)|Gaza War]].

Things started brightly under Head Coach, Steve Gulley, a player with the club, as a 13\u20130 win was recorded over the Clydesdale Colts in the first kitted game.<ref name=\"25years\">{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=Paul |title=Pirates look back on 25 years in the gridrion game |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/pirates-look-back-25-years-2427292 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Daily Record |date=30 March 2010}}</ref> Unfortunately, this was to be the last win of the year, as the team ended up with a 1\u20136 record.\n\n[[1987 in sports|1987]] saw a new head coach with the appointment of Bill Walsh, an American working in East Kilbride. Walsh's influence was apparent as East Kilbride went 4\u20134 to finish second in Division One of the new, Budweiser American Football League.<ref name=\"25years\"/>\n\nWith Coach Walsh's return to the States, a new head coach was appointed in [[1988 in sports|1988]]. Another American, Nick Fantini, was in town on a 12-month exchange visit, and he agreed to take over the reins during his stay. Unfortunately for both Fantini and the club, the previous year's success had resulted in promotion to the Premier Division of the Budweiser League. The higher standard of football quickly became obvious, as the Pirates tumbled to a 0\u201310 season. Included in those 10 losses was a 110\u20130 defeat at the Granite City Oilers. To date this is still the second heaviest defeat suffered in domestic American Football games in the United Kingdom (only Mersey Centurions 148\u20136 defeat of Halton Demons in a 1989 BNGL game was more emphatic).\n\nNick returned home after this season, but he was to return later. The head coach's cap was passed to Alastair Rodger, a Scottish coach who had previously worked with the Clydesdale Colts. Another change in the league set-up saw the club compete in the Combined Gridiron League (Premier Division) in [[1989 in sports|1989]].\n\n[[1990 in sports|1990]] saw the arrival of the British National Gridiron League. The Pirates had a 0\u20139 season, but this year was to be remembered for all the wrong reasons. During a game at the Dundee Whalers, Pirates' linebacker Kenny Hodge received injuries from which he later died. This was the first ever fatality in American Football in Britain, and if any good can come from such a set of circumstances, then the tightening up of player insurance and ambulance cover which followed was one such benefit. After much soul searching within the Club, the Pirates decided to carry on. The Player of the Year Award was renamed in Kenny's memory.\n\n[[1991 in sports|1991]] saw the return of Nick Fantini as Head Coach, with Nick having returned to Scotland. A 3\u20135\u20131 season ensued, but the Club was again rocked by the loss of another player. Cornerback Barry Nunn died from a congenital heart disease, and although his death was not football related, the loss was just as great. A new Most Improved Player Award was created to commemorate Barry.\n\nIn [[1992 in sports|1992]], with the team still in the BNGL National Division, things started to improve on the field. A then Club record 44\u20130 win over the now defunct Glasgow Cyclones, and a 34\u201312 victory at Granite City Oilers being two of the main highlights in a 5\u20135 year.\n\nOn to [[1993 in sports|1993]], and the BNGL Premier Division. Last year's progress continued, and a first ever winning season of 7\u20133 was recorded. Highlights included a nail-biting win at the Edinburgh Eagles to clinch a playoff spot. Involvement in the playoffs was short, with a heavy defeat in England at the hands of a very strong Lancashire Wolverines side.\n\nThe BAFA Senior League arrived in [[1994 in sports|1994]], with East Kilbride in Division 2. In an attempt to improve their standing, the Club arranged to import an American quarterback, Craig Van Ness. Unfortunately, Craig damaged his knee in a skiing accident just before coming to Scotland and was not able to do himself justice. After a month here, he returned to the States. Dunoon based QB, Graeme Henry took over and steered the team to a record of 4\u20134 in a season shortened by other Clubs failing to fulfill their fixtures.\n\n===The Scottish Gridiron Association (1995\u20131998)===\nThe [[1995 in sports|1995]] Season was the first of the independent Scottish Gridiron Association, and the Pirates finished as Conference Champions with a 6\u20133\u20131 record. A loss at Dundee was overturned by League officials and the game awarded to East Kilbride after the Whalers were found guilty of fielding ineligible players. The 6 wins also included an awarded victory over Denny Broncos and an unfulfilled fixture at Granite City was declared a tie. Despite falling at the first hurdle in the playoffs, this was a highly successful year considering the small squad used. An unprecedented number of injuries compounded the problem, but with many players playing both ways, a difficult year was completed with some success.\n\nFollowing this relative success, a number of veteran players announced their retirement. Their places were filled by no fewer than 6 of the Junior squad who moved up to join the Seniors, in addition to the new players recruited from Rookie Trials. This left a very inexperienced squad, and despite the late addition of a number of players from the Clydesdale Colts, who were \"taking a year out\" (but never returned) during [[1996 in sports|1996]], a disappointing Season followed. The Pirates finished with a 2\u20137 record.\n\nFor [[1997 in sports|1997]], East Kilbride lost the services of the former Colts, but these players were more than replaced by the arrival of a significant number of Glasgow Lions players following the demise of what was Scotland's leading Club. The inclusion of both their playing ability and coaching knowledge was a huge benefit to the Pirates who proceeded to go throughout the 1997 Season unbeaten to capture their first Scottish Title. (SGA Bowl III at Caird Park, Dundee)\n\nThe Pirates retained their SGA Title in [[1998 in sports|1998]], defeating Dundee Whalers in the Bowl game, just as they had done 12 months earlier. (SGA Bowl IV at Loch Inch, Glasgow)\n\n===Return to British competition (1999\u20132004)===\n[[1999 in sports|1999]] saw the Pirates return to the British Senior League, where only they and the Strathclyde Sheriffs represented Scotland. While the Sheriffs competed in Division 2, East Kilbride were thrown in at the deep end, as part of Division 1's National Conference. A mixed season followed, with the Pirates winning three of the seven games actually played. This, along with an awarded game saw the Club finish with a 4\u20134 record, and miss a place in the Bowl game by the narrowest of margins.\n\n[[2000 in sports|2000]] saw the BSL realign Division 1, with the Pirates being moved into the Northern Conference. After a slow start, the Pirates went on a long unbeaten run, which only ended in the Play-off Semi Finals. Despite finishing the regular season with a 6\u20132 record, the lack of home field advantage proved too big an obstacle to overcome.\n\nAnother year, another step forward with the Pirates  reaching Britbowl [[2001 in sports|2001]] at Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. The title of Northern Conference Champions was also picked up along the way. What was initially expected to be a rebuilding year exceeded all expectations. The \"void\" game against Cheshire came about following a serious accident to one of the Romans' players on the eve of the game (thankfully he recovered fully). Also, the away game at Nottingham scheduled for 15 July was conceded by the Caesars.\n\n[[2002 in sports|2002]] again saw several changes in personnel and the average age of the side dropped even further. However, the quality of incoming players was again very high. An unbeaten regular season saw the Pirates finish as the Number One ranked side in Division 1. The scheduled first round of the playoffs should have been vs the Chester Romans but the Romans conceded the fixture. The much anticipated semi-final against the PA Knights was played during torrential rain in a mudbath at Brancumhall, and it was the visitors who came out on top after an almighty struggle.\n\nThe Pirates made it all the way to the Final again in [[2003 in sports|2003]], again going undefeated in the regular season. The game at Lancashire was postponed twice before eventually being declared a \"tie\". The play-offs saw a narrow win over Ipswich before again losing out to London O's in Britbowl 2003 in Sheffield.\n\nThe [[2004 in sports|2004]] campaign came on the back of what many{{Who|date=April 2010}} saw as a \"winter of discontent\". Several players left for a variety of reasons and a new squad was assembled under the leadership of James Dougall who was appointed as head coach. An affiliation was also put in place with Clyde Valley Hawks youth team to hopefully ensure a flow of players into the club in future years. The League introduced a Division 1A, with inter-conference games between Div. 1 and 1A teams. The games against Chester Romans (H) and Lancashire Wolverines (A) were awarded to East Kilbride as 1\u20130 wins. Play-off participation ended swiftly at the hands of old nemesis, the London O's.\n\n===Rebuilding years (2005\u20132010)===\n\n[[2005 in sports|2005]] saw the Pirates relinquish the Northern Conference title that they had won in the four preceding seasons. Losses in the two opening away games left a mountain to climb, and while the team did qualify for the play-offs with a 6\u20134 record, it would have been foolhardy to send a small and inexperienced squad to face the London Olympians (formerly the O's). Thus, the game was forfeited.\n\nThe [[2006 in sports|2006]] season saw another influx of young players for The Pirates, from the nearby Youth and University league teams. They started poorly, recording only one win from their first four games, largely due to a season-ending injury to QB Matt McCusker in the opening game at Gateshead; however the season was to turn around in emphatic fashion as Ross Templeton took the snaps and led the team on to five wins out of their remaining six fixtures. A quarter-final win after the long journey to Finsbury Park, London would have set up a much anticipated semi-final against Gateshead but despite a brave performance, The Pirates were defeated. After the close of the 2006 season, BAFL again realigned the league structure, placing the Pirates in the newly formed BAFL Premier League\n\n[[2007 in sports|2007]] started off with another trip to Gateshead and a disappointing 5\u20130 loss to the Senators. One field goal and a safety given on a dubious foul call were all that separated the teams. In the second game, frustrations continued as the Pirates moved the ball well against the Bulls but failed to capitalise on good field positions, eventually throwing two interceptions which led to touchdowns. In the third game, after a flight to Bristol, continuous rain meant fumbles were the order of the day and the Pirates Offense were stagnant and failed again to put any points on the board. The Bristol Aztecs walked away easy winners, scoring on interceptions and their own possession. The fourth game at Crystal Palace against defending British Champions, the London Olympians was called off due to a lack of an ambulance. Game five saw the Pirates rack up their first points of the season, in a spirited  performance at Hamilton which ultimately finished in a loss. The first win of the season came in a hard-fought performance against the ailing Southern Sundevils in a rainy Hamilton Palace bottom-of-the-table clash, where the Sundevils took an early lead but were eventually outgunned by the Pirates. Game seven saw a depleted squad travel to Warwick to play Coventry and put up a spirited performance in which they outscored the jets in the second half. Unfortunately a first half rout meant it made little difference and it was another long journey home on the back of a loss for the Pirates. The final two home games of the season saw a defeat to the London Blitz, despite an early Pirates lead followed by a 19\u20136 win over the Gateshead Senators on a day where the score could have been much higher for the rampant Pirates. The season was completed with a 13\u20130 away victory over Birmingham Bulls.\n\nThe off-season prior to the [[2008 in sports|2008]] campaign was unusual as the London O's were forced to pull out of the league once the schedule had been set. This meant that the northern teams lost one game and the southern teams lost two, so to even the fixtures, the Pirates also lost an away game to Coventry Jets. On their season opener, they broke a three-year opening-day curse by beating the Gateshead Senators comfortably 34\u20138. Game two saw a spirited performance despite a heavy loss at home to the Coventry Jets, which was followed by a crushing defeat in London at the hands of the reigning champion London Blitz. Game four saw Pirates pick up the pace again with a good win in Gateshead and this was followed by a strong victory away to the Birmingham Bulls, with a travelling squad of only 19 players, to put the Pirates second in the division. In game 6, a tough visit to Aldershot Army Stadium to play the Farnham Knights resulted in a heavy defeat, again highlighting the gulf between some teams in the Premier Division. In an all-or-nothing game seven, the Pirates played poorly and lost to the Bristol Aztecs, ending their playoff hopes. The final game was forfeited by the Bulls, giving a record of 4\u20134 but leaving many to question the sustainability of the Premier League. Running concurrently to the kitted league, the Pirates also entered a team into the inaugural BAFA Adult Flag contest and fared reasonably well, however it was felt by the committee and the players that flag football distracted from the team's primary aim of supporting a kitted team and so this was dissolved after 2008.\n\nTrue to Pirates recent form, more off-season drama preceded the [[2009 in sports|2009]] season. The BAFL decided that due to a number of factors (namely London O's dropping out of the Premier Division prior to the '08 season and both Gateshead and Birmingham failing to complete their fixtures) they would reduce the Premier Division to six teams for 2009. These six teams would be the five teams who completed their '08 Premier fixtures, as well as the newly promoted Sussex Thunder. Due to this increase in teams based in the South of England, Pirates travelling distances were set to rocket, with the consequence that costs, too, would increase dramatically. Despite ongoing discussions, in which the Pirates outlined the problems which this would cause, the decision had been made and the Pirates had to make the regrettable move of stepping down to BAFL Division 1 North. This gave them the opportunity to regroup and find a new home with Hamilton Rugby Club. They opened their account with a 50-point demolition of nearby team the West Coast Trojans in the teams' first ever meeting. This was followed by a scrappy victory over the Dundee Hurricanes and comfortable defeats of the visiting Merseyside Nighthawks and Gateshead Senators. Their first real challenge of the season came in game 5, where they managed a two-point victory over the Yorkshire Rams; however they found another gear the following week, recording a 17-point win over the same opposition in the return leg. Their seventh game saw the team visit the second-placed Doncaster Mustangs, where they won 42\u201322 and clinched their conference title for the first time since 2004. Game eight was cancelled as the Trojans were unable to field a team, giving the Pirates a 1\u20130 win and in game nine, they were held to a draw by the Dundee Hurricanes after backup Quarterback Darren Brownlie suffered a broken collar bone. In the final game of the regular season, the Pirates visited old rivals the Gateshead Senators and fell to a 7\u20136 loss after a dismal offensive performance. They turned this result around the following week to beat the Senators and book their place in the British Semi Final. Here they beat the Tamworth Phoenix in an impressive 25\u20130 sweep, before losing to the London Cobras at Britbowl.\n\nThe Pirates once again competed in the Division 1 North in the [[2010 in sports|2010]] season. This time around, they completed a clean sweep of the regular season with a 10\u20130 record, conceding less than 6 points per game and scoring over 35. They finished the season with the overall #1 ranking in the UK among Division 1 teams, thereby securing home field advantage throughout the playoffs at their new home ground of Whitecraigs Rugby Club, Newton Mearns. In the playoffs they won a close battle with Division 1 newcomers the Leicester Falcons, before securing their place in a second successive final with a victory over the Ipswich Cardinals. In the final, held at Worcester Warriors Sixways Stadium, they fell to a very strong performance from the team they beat in the previous years semi-final, the Tamworth Phoenix. Despite the disappointment, it was another strong season as the team celebrated their 25th anniversary. Two weeks after the conclusion of the season, the Pirates launched their first Youth and Junior team setup since 1998 and Chairman Matthew Davies announced that he would step down in January, after three and a half years leading the club. At the team's AGM, Amanda McDonald was voted in as his replacement, the first time a woman had led a Scottish senior American Football team.\n\n===National Champions, 2011===\n\nThe quest for the Division 1 North title began again in [[2011 in sports|2011]] and with the exception of an away loss to the Doncaster Mustangs, where starting QB Ryan Hunter was unavailable and his replacement Neil Baptie had his collarbone broken by a jarring hit early on, the Pirates sailed through the regular season with a 9\u20131 record. The playoffs saw a home game against the Yorkshire Rams where EK, followed by a visit to old rivals the Birmingham Bulls, who the Pirates dispatched with a 47\u201327 scoreline to book their third consecutive finals place. The event, held at Crystal Palace, London, was expected to go the way of the Leicester Falcons (who the Pirates narrowly defeated, 22\u201320 in the 2010 Quarter Final), but the Pirates came out of the blocks firing and scored TDs on each of their first six possessions, racking up a 42\u20130 half time lead. The second half was a closer affair, but the Falcons never looked close to making up the ground, eventually succumbing by a scoreline of 62\u201323 and handing the Pirates their first ever National Championship.\n<gallery>\nFile:BritbowlXXV.JPG|BritbowlXXV \u2013 Pirates vs Falcons\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy1.JPG|Britbowl XXV trophy with WR Jamie McLaughlin and OL Andrew MacIver\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy2.JPG|Britbowl XXV trophy\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy3.jpg|Trophy with OL Matthew Davies\nFile:BritBowlXXV5.JPG| Trophy with WR Jamie McLaughlin, OL Andrew MacIver, OL Alex McCallum and Gage Czekalla (stats team)\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy4.JPG| The team celebrate with the BritBowl XXV Division One trophy\n</gallery>\n\n===Back in the Premier Division, 2012\u20132018===\n\nWith BAFANL opting to move from a single 6-team Premier to a split 6 North/6 South Premier for the 2012 season, The Pirates were places in the Northern conference, alongside the Yorkshire Rams, Doncaster Mustangs, Leicester Falcons, Tamworth Phoenix and Birmingham Bulls. The season was successful on the field for the team, but a number of the other Northern teams had significant problems, leading 4 games being cancelled (Doncaster away, both Leicester fixtures and Birmingham at home). The Pirates went 5\u20131 on the field (9\u20131 when forfeits were added in) and topped the conference, earning a bye into the semi final. The London Blitz travelled up to play the Pirates in their fourth ever meeting and the night before the game, their bus was set robbed and on fire! On the day, the pirates took a 7\u20130 lead, before falling 14\u20137 behind and then regaining a 17\u201314 lead in the 4th quarter. With only minutes to go, the Blitz took a 21\u201317 lead and the Pirates, whilst driving down the field, fumbled the ball away on their final possession, allowing the Blitz to kneel out the game. Despite the setback, it was a strong showing and proof that the Pirates were a good fit in the Premier Division.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2012 season, it was announced that there would be another restructure of the top flight, expanding each side of the Premier Division to 11-team Conferences. Each team is scheduled to play the others in its conference once; 5 home and 5 away. This will see the Pirates face an opponent for the first time (Sheffield Predators) as well as continuing their rivalries with the Mustangs, Rams, Bulls and Phoenix, playing the Lancashire Wolverines for the first time since 2004, the Nottinghams Caesars for the first time in seven years and the Coventry Jets (who the Pirates have never beaten) for the first time since 2008. They will also face Scottish opposition (West Coast Trojans) for the first time since 2009.\n\nEast Kilbride had another strong campaign in 2013, powering through the schedule without loss, racking up only their third perfect 10\u20130 season in history (but the second in four seasons and only the second in the top flight), including two comprehensive victories over the local West Coast Trojans, extending the record to 17 seasons without loss to another Scottish team. The team performed well in poor conditions in the Semi Final to record their first ever win against the Bristol Aztecs, but in a repeat of the previous year's semi-final, they again fell to the London Blitz by 4 points, despite having their chances to win. The Blitz finally lost their title to the London Warriors.\n\nThe 2014 season started with a 72\u20130 whitewash of Gateshead Senators, with the Pirates notching up their biggest win since 2011, followed by a 41\u20130 victory away to Sheffield. The strong results continued (despite forfeits from Yorkshire Rams and Doncaster Mustangs) and the Pirates were 8\u20130, going into the final game of the regular season, away to Tamworth Phoenix. The game was streamed online and hundreds of viewers saw EKP win a nailbiter 14\u20137 and claim their fifth conference title in a row, along with home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Two weeks later, they hosted the London Olympians in the Quarter Finals (a team the Pirates had never beaten in six attempts) and dismantled them by a score of 52\u201318. The following week saw a rematch of the last two semi finals, with the London Blitz travelling up to take on the Pirates for a spot at Britbowl.\n\n2015 saw the Pirates lose two regular season games for the first time since 2008, to Lancashire Wolverines and Tamworth Phoenix, but they turned both results around in the second meetings and managed to do so with a good enough points difference to claim the #1 spot in the North for the seventh year running. With a new format and no Quarter Finals this year, the team hosted the London Blitz for the fourth year in a row in the British Semi Finals and for the fourth year in a row they came off worse, losing 19\u20137 in a nail biter where the visitors scored on a pass, a punt return and a strip returned for a TD.\n\nThe 2016 season saw the Pirates lose four regular season games, lose the northern champions crown and fail to qualify for playoffs for the first time in eight years. The retirement of many long-time players, coupled with an influx of new players had led to the challenge of a larger, but less experienced squad. The off-season saw refocusing for the team and 2017 sees the first wholsale graduation of members the club's junior team to play senior football, with six junior graduates stepping up to adult football.\n\nAnother disappointing season followed in 2017 which finished 4-5-1 and again saw the team miss out of playoff action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://piratesfootball.co.uk/2017/08/1751/|title=Season ends for Pirates with loss away to Sheffield Giants|date=2017-08-09|website=East Kilbride Pirates|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> Following a disappointing start to the 2018 campaign including a historic loss against Scottish rivals the Edinburgh Wolves, the team parted ways with Head Coach Ross Templeton after the third game of the season, replacing him with former vetern player and junior offensive coordinator Jamie McLaughlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dblcoverage.com/east-kilbride-pirates-part-ways-with-head-coach-templeton/|title=East Kilbride Pirates Part Ways With Head Coach Templeton|last=Nick|date=2018-05-15|website=Double Coverage|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>  Despite this, the team went winless for the rest of the season and were relegated to Division 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gridiron-east-kilbride-pirates-head-12973965|title=Gridiron: East Kilbride Pirates head coach defiant as club are relegated|last=Thomson|first=Paul|date=2018-07-27|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Rebuilding once again 2019 - ===\n\n==Season Record==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

They competed in the BAFANL Youth league in 2011 and won their first tournament, but ultimately missed the playoffs. In their second year, they continued their development, but again fell short of playoff contention. That year saw their first youth player graduate to the local Lanarkshire Longhorns Junior side. In 2014, they qualified for BritBowl for the first time, travelling down to Doncaster and beating the UK #1 seed in their first game, before losing out in double overtime in the semi-final. In 2015, they again qualified for the Semi Finals and completed their regular season fixtures by beating the dominant Highland Wildcats for the first time in their history.\n\nIn 2016, the Pirates youth team continued to extend their dominance by finishing as overall Scottish Champions, knocking the Highland Wildcats off the top spot for the first time in over five years and qualifying for u17s British Finals in Sheffield on Saturday 3 September. The Pirates went on to sail through each round of the finals, culminating in a championship final win against Cobham Cougars that saw the Pirates take the u17s British Championship title. Jack Cochrane was named as youth BritBowl MVP. The scores were as follows:\n\nQuarter-final \u2013 East Kilbride Pirates 16 v 8 Birmingham Bulls\nSemi-final \u2013 Chester Romans 13 v 25 East Kilbride Pirates\nNational Championship Final: East Kilbride Pirates 37 v 6 Cobham Cougars\n\nThe Pirates Youth made the final again in 2017, this time narrowly losing out to the Cougars.\n\nThe Pirates won their Second youth National Championship in 2018 with running back Mathew Black being the MVP in the final, the results were as follows:\nQuarter-Finals: Kent Exiles 14-26 Pirates, Semi-Finals: Leeds Academy Assassins 13-27 Pirates: National Championship Game: Chorley Buccaneers 22-51 Pirates\n\n'''The Hamilton Buccaneers'''\n\nIn 2012, the Pirates increased their coverage in Lanarkshire by creating a second Youth team, the Hamilton Buccaneers. The Bucs have continued to grow, consistently finishing #3 in the Scottish youth conference, and in 2017 launched the club's first youth flag endeavor.\n\n'''East Kilbride Pirates Junior'''\n\nIn mid 2013, the team announced plans for a Junior team, to compete in the 16\u201319 age range and bridge the gap between Youth and Senior.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=Paul |title=Gridiron: East Kilbride Pirates look to youth for new season |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gridiron-east-kilbride-pirates-look-10155719 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Daily Record |date=4 April 2017}}</ref> They played their first season in 2014 with a small squad, recording 2 wins, however a good graduating class from the two youth teams boosted the 2015 playing squad and the team won two games before finishing their season by winning a friendly against Clackmannanshire Ravens in the off-season after a change of coaching staff once the season had ended. Further additions from the two Youth teams and an expansion of the coaching staff boosted the squad and in 2016 they went on to become Scottish Champions, Northern Champions and British u19s championship runners-up.\n\nIn 2017 the team repeated this achievement, narrowly losing in the British Final to the London Blitz, in the highest scoring Junior final in British history. This made the Pirates the first Scottish team ever to appear in more than one British Championship game.\n\nIn 2018 the junior team went 5-1 in the regular season, and narrowly lost out to Manchester Titans in the semi-final, in a game that went to overtime. The team went on to compete in the National Plate final, winning the championship 46-0 against Herfordshire Cheetahs.\n\nIn 2019, despite having the team's youngest and most inexperienced squad to date, the team finished their regular season 6-0, and won a semi-final 13-9 against Birmingham Lions to qualify for their third appearance at the British U19 final in four years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gridiron-east-kilbride-pirates-junior-19028970|title=Gridiron: East Kilbride Pirates' junior team set sail for national final|last=Thomson|first=Paul|date=2019-08-30|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> The game was streamed by BBC Sport,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/american-football/49542402|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> and despite strong hopes the Scots were shut out 26-0 against a fast and physical London Blitz junior team.\n\n==Women's teams==\nIn September 2015 the East Kilbride Pirates launched their first women's team. The call for players met with a positive local response and the team competed in the British American Football Association's Opal Series flag competition for women. The Pirates women's team compete in the Opal flag and Sapphire kitted competitions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=Paul |title=East Kilbride Pirates to launch women's team |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/east-kilbride-pirates-launch-womens-6409793 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Daily Record |date=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the women's section split into distinct contact and flag teams. In 2018 the club appointed Claire Cochrane as their first ever female head coach to lead the women's contact team.\n\nIn 2019 the women's flag team finished 3rd in the UK Opal Series. The highest positioning in their history.\n\nIn 2020 the women's flag team lifted the 1st place trophy for the first women's bracket at the Flagging New Year tournament.\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gridiron-east-kilbride-pirates-womens-13198208|title=Gridiron: East Kilbride Pirates Women's team appoint first female head coach|last=Thomson|first=Paul|date=2018-09-07|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.piratesfootball.co.uk East Kilbride Pirates Official Site]\n\n{{British American Football}}\n{{BAFL seasons|British American Football League seasons}}\n\n[[Category:BAFA National League teams]]\n[[Category:American football teams in Scotland]]\n[[Category:East Kilbride]]\n[[Category:Sport in South Lanarkshire]]\n[[Category:Hamilton, South Lanarkshire]]\n[[Category:1985 establishments in Scotland]]\n[[Category:American football teams established in 1985]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2018}}\n{{Infobox American football team\n| name          = East Kilbride Pirates\n| logo          = Logo for the East Kilbride American Football Team.png\n| logosize      = 250px\n| helmet        =\n| helmetsize    = \n| established   = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1985}}\n| folded        = <!-- {{End date|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| location      = [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]\n| stadium       = GHA Rugby Football Club\n| coach         = Jamie McLaughlin\n| manager       = Amanda McDonald\n| league        = [[BAFA National Leagues]]\n| division      = NFC 1 North\n| league_champs = '''1''' (2011)\n| div_champs    = '''11''' (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015)\n| sponsor       = \n| website       = <!--{{URL|example.com}} -->\n| h_pattern_h   =_af\n| h_pattern_la  =\n| h_pattern_b   =\n| h_pattern_ra  =\n| h_pattern_p   =\n| h_pattern_s   =_af\n| h_helmet      = \n| h_leftarm     =\n| h_body        =\n| h_rightarm    =\n| h_pants       =\n| h_socks       =\n| h_title       = Home\n| a_pattern_h   =_af\n| a_pattern_la  =\n| a_pattern_b   =\n| a_pattern_ra  =\n| a_pattern_p   =\n| a_pattern_s   =_af\n| a_helmet      =  \n| a_leftarm     =\n| a_body        =\n| a_rightarm    =\n| a_pants       =\n| a_socks       =\n| a_title       = Away\n}}\n\nThe '''East Kilbride Pirates''' are a British [[American Football]] team based in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].

Things started brightly under Head Coach, Steve Gulley, a player with the club, as a 13\u20130 win was recorded over the Clydesdale Colts in the first kitted game.<ref name=\"25years\">{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=Paul |title=Pirates look back on 25 years in the gridrion game |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/pirates-look-back-25-years-2427292 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Daily Record |date=30 March 2010}}</ref> Unfortunately, this was to be the last win of the year, as the team ended up with a 1\u20136 record.\n\n[[1987 in sports|1987]] saw a new head coach with the appointment of Bill Walsh, an American working in East Kilbride. Walsh's influence was apparent as East Kilbride went 4\u20134 to finish second in Division One of the new, Budweiser American Football League.<ref name=\"25years\"/>\n\nWith Coach Walsh's return to the States, a new head coach was appointed in [[1988 in sports|1988]]. Another American, Nick Fantini, was in town on a 12-month exchange visit, and he agreed to take over the reins during his stay. Unfortunately for both Fantini and the club, the previous year's success had resulted in promotion to the Premier Division of the Budweiser League. The higher standard of football quickly became obvious, as the Pirates tumbled to a 0\u201310 season. Included in those 10 losses was a 110\u20130 defeat at the Granite City Oilers. To date this is still the second heaviest defeat suffered in domestic American Football games in the United Kingdom (only Mersey Centurions 148\u20136 defeat of Halton Demons in a 1989 BNGL game was more emphatic).\n\nNick returned home after this season, but he was to return later. The head coach's cap was passed to Alastair Rodger, a Scottish coach who had previously worked with the Clydesdale Colts. Another change in the league set-up saw the club compete in the Combined Gridiron League (Premier Division) in [[1989 in sports|1989]].\n\n[[1990 in sports|1990]] saw the arrival of the British National Gridiron League. The Pirates had a 0\u20139 season, but this year was to be remembered for all the wrong reasons. During a game at the Dundee Whalers, Pirates' linebacker Kenny Hodge received injuries from which he later died. This was the first ever fatality in American Football in Britain, and if any good can come from such a set of circumstances, then the tightening up of player insurance and ambulance cover which followed was one such benefit. After much soul searching within the Club, the Pirates decided to carry on. The Player of the Year Award was renamed in Kenny's memory.\n\n[[1991 in sports|1991]] saw the return of Nick Fantini as Head Coach, with Nick having returned to Scotland. A 3\u20135\u20131 season ensued, but the Club was again rocked by the loss of another player. Cornerback Barry Nunn died from a congenital heart disease, and although his death was not football related, the loss was just as great. A new Most Improved Player Award was created to commemorate Barry.\n\nIn [[1992 in sports|1992]], with the team still in the BNGL National Division, things started to improve on the field. A then Club record 44\u20130 win over the now defunct Glasgow Cyclones, and a 34\u201312 victory at Granite City Oilers being two of the main highlights in a 5\u20135 year.\n\nOn to [[1993 in sports|1993]], and the BNGL Premier Division. Last year's progress continued, and a first ever winning season of 7\u20133 was recorded. Highlights included a nail-biting win at the Edinburgh Eagles to clinch a playoff spot. Involvement in the playoffs was short, with a heavy defeat in England at the hands of a very strong Lancashire Wolverines side.\n\nThe BAFA Senior League arrived in [[1994 in sports|1994]], with East Kilbride in Division 2. In an attempt to improve their standing, the Club arranged to import an American quarterback, Craig Van Ness. Unfortunately, Craig damaged his knee in a skiing accident just before coming to Scotland and was not able to do himself justice. After a month here, he returned to the States. Dunoon based QB, Graeme Henry took over and steered the team to a record of 4\u20134 in a season shortened by other Clubs failing to fulfill their fixtures.\n\n===The Scottish Gridiron Association (1995\u20131998)===\nThe [[1995 in sports|1995]] Season was the first of the independent Scottish Gridiron Association, and the Pirates finished as Conference Champions with a 6\u20133\u20131 record. A loss at Dundee was overturned by League officials and the game awarded to East Kilbride after the Whalers were found guilty of fielding ineligible players. The 6 wins also included an awarded victory over Denny Broncos and an unfulfilled fixture at Granite City was declared a tie. Despite falling at the first hurdle in the playoffs, this was a highly successful year considering the small squad used. An unprecedented number of injuries compounded the problem, but with many players playing both ways, a difficult year was completed with some success.\n\nFollowing this relative success, a number of veteran players announced their retirement. Their places were filled by no fewer than 6 of the Junior squad who moved up to join the Seniors, in addition to the new players recruited from Rookie Trials. This left a very inexperienced squad, and despite the late addition of a number of players from the Clydesdale Colts, who were \"taking a year out\" (but never returned) during [[1996 in sports|1996]], a disappointing Season followed. The Pirates finished with a 2\u20137 record.\n\nFor [[1997 in sports|1997]], East Kilbride lost the services of the former Colts, but these players were more than replaced by the arrival of a significant number of Glasgow Lions players following the demise of what was Scotland's leading Club. The inclusion of both their playing ability and coaching knowledge was a huge benefit to the Pirates who proceeded to go throughout the 1997 Season unbeaten to capture their first Scottish Title. (SGA Bowl III at Caird Park, Dundee)\n\nThe Pirates retained their SGA Title in [[1998 in sports|1998]], defeating Dundee Whalers in the Bowl game, just as they had done 12 months earlier. (SGA Bowl IV at Loch Inch, Glasgow)\n\n===Return to British competition (1999\u20132004)===\n[[1999 in sports|1999]] saw the Pirates return to the British Senior League, where only they and the Strathclyde Sheriffs represented Scotland. While the Sheriffs competed in Division 2, East Kilbride were thrown in at the deep end, as part of Division 1's National Conference. A mixed season followed, with the Pirates winning three of the seven games actually played. This, along with an awarded game saw the Club finish with a 4\u20134 record, and miss a place in the Bowl game by the narrowest of margins.\n\n[[2000 in sports|2000]] saw the BSL realign Division 1, with the Pirates being moved into the Northern Conference. After a slow start, the Pirates went on a long unbeaten run, which only ended in the Play-off Semi Finals. Despite finishing the regular season with a 6\u20132 record, the lack of home field advantage proved too big an obstacle to overcome.\n\nAnother year, another step forward with the Pirates  reaching Britbowl [[2001 in sports|2001]] at Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. The title of Northern Conference Champions was also picked up along the way. What was initially expected to be a rebuilding year exceeded all expectations. The \"void\" game against Cheshire came about following a serious accident to one of the Romans' players on the eve of the game (thankfully he recovered fully). Also, the away game at Nottingham scheduled for 15 July was conceded by the Caesars.\n\n[[2002 in sports|2002]] again saw several changes in personnel and the average age of the side dropped even further. However, the quality of incoming players was again very high. An unbeaten regular season saw the Pirates finish as the Number One ranked side in Division 1. The scheduled first round of the playoffs should have been vs the Chester Romans but the Romans conceded the fixture. The much anticipated semi-final against the PA Knights was played during torrential rain in a mudbath at Brancumhall, and it was the visitors who came out on top after an almighty struggle.\n\nThe Pirates made it all the way to the Final again in [[2003 in sports|2003]], again going undefeated in the regular season. The game at Lancashire was postponed twice before eventually being declared a \"tie\". The play-offs saw a narrow win over Ipswich before again losing out to London O's in Britbowl 2003 in Sheffield.\n\nThe [[2004 in sports|2004]] campaign came on the back of what many{{Who|date=April 2010}} saw as a \"winter of discontent\". Several players left for a variety of reasons and a new squad was assembled under the leadership of James Dougall who was appointed as head coach. An affiliation was also put in place with Clyde Valley Hawks youth team to hopefully ensure a flow of players into the club in future years. The League introduced a Division 1A, with inter-conference games between Div. 1 and 1A teams. The games against Chester Romans (H) and Lancashire Wolverines (A) were awarded to East Kilbride as 1\u20130 wins. Play-off participation ended swiftly at the hands of old nemesis, the London O's.\n\n===Rebuilding years (2005\u20132010)===\n\n[[2005 in sports|2005]] saw the Pirates relinquish the Northern Conference title that they had won in the four preceding seasons. Losses in the two opening away games left a mountain to climb, and while the team did qualify for the play-offs with a 6\u20134 record, it would have been foolhardy to send a small and inexperienced squad to face the London Olympians (formerly the O's). Thus, the game was forfeited.\n\nThe [[2006 in sports|2006]] season saw another influx of young players for The Pirates, from the nearby Youth and University league teams. They started poorly, recording only one win from their first four games, largely due to a season-ending injury to QB Matt McCusker in the opening game at Gateshead; however the season was to turn around in emphatic fashion as Ross Templeton took the snaps and led the team on to five wins out of their remaining six fixtures. A quarter-final win after the long journey to Finsbury Park, London would have set up a much anticipated semi-final against Gateshead but despite a brave performance, The Pirates were defeated. After the close of the 2006 season, BAFL again realigned the league structure, placing the Pirates in the newly formed BAFL Premier League\n\n[[2007 in sports|2007]] started off with another trip to Gateshead and a disappointing 5\u20130 loss to the Senators. One field goal and a safety given on a dubious foul call were all that separated the teams. In the second game, frustrations continued as the Pirates moved the ball well against the Bulls but failed to capitalise on good field positions, eventually throwing two interceptions which led to touchdowns. In the third game, after a flight to Bristol, continuous rain meant fumbles were the order of the day and the Pirates Offense were stagnant and failed again to put any points on the board. The Bristol Aztecs walked away easy winners, scoring on interceptions and their own possession. The fourth game at Crystal Palace against defending British Champions, the London Olympians was called off due to a lack of an ambulance. Game five saw the Pirates rack up their first points of the season, in a spirited  performance at Hamilton which ultimately finished in a loss. The first win of the season came in a hard-fought performance against the ailing Southern Sundevils in a rainy Hamilton Palace bottom-of-the-table clash, where the Sundevils took an early lead but were eventually outgunned by the Pirates. Game seven saw a depleted squad travel to Warwick to play Coventry and put up a spirited performance in which they outscored the jets in the second half. Unfortunately a first half rout meant it made little difference and it was another long journey home on the back of a loss for the Pirates. The final two home games of the season saw a defeat to the London Blitz, despite an early Pirates lead followed by a 19\u20136 win over the Gateshead Senators on a day where the score could have been much higher for the rampant Pirates. The season was completed with a 13\u20130 away victory over Birmingham Bulls.\n\nThe off-season prior to the [[2008 in sports|2008]] campaign was unusual as the London O's were forced to pull out of the league once the schedule had been set. This meant that the northern teams lost one game and the southern teams lost two, so to even the fixtures, the Pirates also lost an away game to Coventry Jets. On their season opener, they broke a three-year opening-day curse by beating the Gateshead Senators comfortably 34\u20138. Game two saw a spirited performance despite a heavy loss at home to the Coventry Jets, which was followed by a crushing defeat in London at the hands of the reigning champion London Blitz. Game four saw Pirates pick up the pace again with a good win in Gateshead and this was followed by a strong victory away to the Birmingham Bulls, with a travelling squad of only 19 players, to put the Pirates second in the division. In game 6, a tough visit to Aldershot Army Stadium to play the Farnham Knights resulted in a heavy defeat, again highlighting the gulf between some teams in the Premier Division. In an all-or-nothing game seven, the Pirates played poorly and lost to the Bristol Aztecs, ending their playoff hopes. The final game was forfeited by the Bulls, giving a record of 4\u20134 but leaving many to question the sustainability of the Premier League. Running concurrently to the kitted league, the Pirates also entered a team into the inaugural BAFA Adult Flag contest and fared reasonably well, however it was felt by the committee and the players that flag football distracted from the teams primary aim of supporting a kitted team and so this was dissolved after 2008.\n\nTrue to Pirates recent form, more off-season drama preceded the [[2009 in sports|2009]] season. The BAFL decided that due to a number of factors (namely London O's dropping out of the Premier Division prior to the '08 season and both Gateshead and Birmingham failing to complete their fixtures) they would reduce the Premier Division to six teams for 2009. These six teams would be the five teams who completed their '08 Premier fixtures, as well as the newly promoted Sussex Thunder. Due to this increase in teams based in the South of England, Pirates travelling distances were set to rocket, with the consequence that costs, too, would increase dramatically. Despite ongoing discussions, in which the Pirates outlined the problems which this would cause, the decision had been made and the Pirates had to make the regrettable move of stepping down to BAFL Division 1 North. This gave them the opportunity to regroup and find a new home with Hamilton Rugby Club. They opened their account with a 50-point demolition of nearby team the West Coast Trojans in the teams' first ever meeting. This was followed by a scrappy victory over the Dundee Hurricanes and comfortable defeats of the visiting Merseyside Nighthawks and Gateshead Senators. Their first real challenge of the season came in game 5, where they managed a two-point victory over the Yorkshire Rams; however they found another gear the following week, recording a 17-point win over the same opposition in the return leg. Their seventh game saw the team visit the second-placed Doncaster Mustangs, where they won 42\u201322 and clinched their conference title for the first time since 2004. Game eight was cancelled as the Trojans were unable to field a team, giving the Pirates a 1\u20130 win and in game nine, they were held to a draw by the Dundee Hurricanes after backup Quarterback Darren Brownlie suffered a broken collar bone. In the final game of the regular season, the Pirates visited old rivals the Gateshead Senators and fell to a 7\u20136 loss after a dismal offensive performance. They turned this result around the following week to beat the Senators and book their place in the British Semi Final. Here they beat the Tamworth Phoenix in an impressive 25\u20130 sweep, before losing to the London Cobras at Britbowl.\n\nThe Pirates once again competed in the Division 1 North in the [[2010 in sports|2010]] season. This time around, they completed a clean sweep of the regular season with a 10\u20130 record, conceding less than 6 points per game and scoring over 35. They finished the season with the overall #1 ranking in the UK among Division 1 teams, thereby securing home field advantage throughout the playoffs at their new home ground of Whitecraigs Rugby Club, Newton Mearns. In the playoffs they won a close battle with Division 1 newcomers the Leicester Falcons, before securing their place in a second successive final with a victory over the Ipswich Cardinals. In the final, held at Worcester Warriors Sixways Stadium, they fell to a very strong performance from the team they beat in the previous years semi-final, the Tamworth Phoenix. Despite the disappointment, it was another strong season as the team celebrated their 25th anniversary. Two weeks after the conclusion of the season, the Pirates launched their first Youth and Junior team setup since 1998 and Chairman Matthew Davies announced that he would step down in January, after three and a half years leading the club. At the teams AGM, Amanda McDonald was voted in as his replacement, the first time a woman had led a Scottish senior American Football team.\n\n===National Champions, 2011===\n\nThe quest for the Division 1 North title began again in [[2011 in sports|2011]] and with the exception of an away loss to the Doncaster Mustangs, where starting QB Ryan Hunter was unavailable and his replacement Neil Baptie had his collarbone broken by a jarring hit early on, the Pirates sailed through the regular season with a 9\u20131 record. The playoffs saw a home game against the Yorkshire Rams where EK, followed by a visit to old rivals the Birmingham Bulls, who the Pirates dispatched with a 47\u201327 scoreline to book their third consecutive finals place. The event, held at Crystal Palace, London, was expected to go the way of the Leicester Falcons (who the Pirates narrowly defeated, 22\u201320 in the 2010 Quarter Final), but the Pirates came out of the blocks firing and scored TDs on each of their first six possessions, racking up a 42\u20130 half time lead. The second half was a closer affair, but the Falcons never looked close to making up the ground, eventually succumbing by a scoreline of 62\u201323 and handing the Pirates their first ever National Championship.\n<gallery>\nFile:BritbowlXXV.JPG|BritbowlXXV \u2013 Pirates vs Falcons\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy1.JPG|Britbowl XXV trophy with WR Jamie McLaughlin and OL Andrew MacIver\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy2.JPG|Britbowl XXV trophy\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy3.jpg|Trophy with OL Matthew Davies\nFile:BritBowlXXV5.JPG| Trophy with WR Jamie McLaughlin, OL Andrew MacIver, OL Alex McCallum and Gage Czekalla (stats team)\nFile:BritbowlXXV-trophy4.JPG| The team celebrate with the BritBowl XXV Division One trophy\n</gallery>\n\n===Back in the Premier Division, 2012\u20132018===\n\nWith BAFANL opting to move from a single 6-team Premier to a split 6 North/6 South Premier for the 2012 season, The Pirates were places in the Northern conference, alongside the Yorkshire Rams, Doncaster Mustangs, Leicester Falcons, Tamworth Phoenix and Birmingham Bulls. The season was successful on the field for the team, but a number of the other Northern teams had significant problems, leading 4 games being cancelled (Doncaster away, both Leicester fixtures and Birmingham at home). The Pirates went 5\u20131 on the field (9\u20131 when forfeits were added in) and topped the conference, earning a bye into the semi final. The London Blitz travelled up to play the Pirates in their fourth ever meeting and the night before the game, their bus was set robbed and on fire! On the day, the pirates took a 7\u20130 lead, before falling 14\u20137 behind and then regaining a 17\u201314 lead in the 4th quarter. With only minutes to go, the Blitz took a 21\u201317 lead and the Pirates, whilst driving down the field, fumbled the ball away on their final possession, allowing the Blitz to kneel out the game. Despite the setback, it was a strong showing and proof that the Pirates were a good fit in the Premier Division.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2012 season, it was announced that there would be another restructure of the top flight, expanding each side of the Premier Division to 11-team Conferences. Each team is scheduled to play the others in its conference once; 5 home and 5 away. This will see the Pirates face an opponent for the first time (Sheffield Predators) as well as continuing their rivalries with the Mustangs, Rams, Bulls and Phoenix, playing the Lancashire Wolverines for the first time since 2004, the Nottinghams Caesars for the first time in seven years and the Coventry Jets (who the Pirates have never beaten) for the first time since 2008. They will also face Scottish opposition (West Coast Trojans) for the first time since 2009.\n\nEast Kilbride had another strong campaign in 2013, powering through the schedule without loss, racking up only their third perfect 10\u20130 season in history (but the second in four seasons and only the second in the top flight), including two comprehensive victories over the local West Coast Trojans, extending the record to 17 seasons without loss to another Scottish team. The team performed well in poor conditions in the Semi Final to record their first ever win against the Bristol Aztecs, but in a repeat of the previous year's semi-final, they again fell to the London Blitz by 4 points, despite having their chances to win. The Blitz finally lost their title to the London Warriors.\n\nThe 2014 season started with a 72\u20130 whitewash of Gateshead Senators, with the Pirates notching up their biggest win since 2011, followed by a 41\u20130 victory away to Sheffield. The strong results continued (despite forfeits from Yorkshire Rams and Doncaster Mustangs) and the Pirates were 8\u20130, going into the final game of the regular season, away to Tamworth Phoenix. The game was streamed online and hundreds of viewers saw EKP win a nailbiter 14\u20137 and claim their fifth conference title in a row, along with home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Two weeks later, they hosted the London Olympians in the Quarter Finals (a team the Pirates had never beaten in six attempts) and dismantled them by a score of 52\u201318. The following week saw a rematch of the last two semi finals, with the London Blitz travelling up to take on the Pirates for a spot at Britbowl.\n\n2015 saw the Pirates lose two regular season games for the first time since 2008, to Lancashire Wolverines and Tamworth Phoenix, but they turned both results around in the second meetings and managed to do so with a good enough points difference to claim the #1 spot in the North for the seventh year running. With a new format and no Quarter Finals this year, the team hosted the London Blitz for the fourth year in a row in the British Semi Finals and for the fourth year in a row they came off worse, losing 19\u20137 in a nail biter where the visitors scored on a pass, a punt return and a strip returned for a TD.\n\nThe 2016 season saw the Pirates lose four regular season games, lose the northern champions crown and fail to qualify for playoffs for the first time in eight years. The retirement of many long-time players, coupled with an influx of new players had led to the challenge of a larger, but less experienced squad. The off-season saw refocusing for the team and 2017 sees the first wholsale graduation of members the club's junior team to play senior football, with six junior graduates stepping up to adult football.\n\nAnother disappointing season followed in 2017 which finished 4-5-1 and again saw the team miss out of playoff action<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://piratesfootball.co.uk/2017/08/1751/|title=Season ends for Pirates with loss away to Sheffield Giants|date=2017-08-09|website=East Kilbride Pirates|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>.

They competed in the BAFANL Youth league in 2011 and won their first tournament, but ultimately missed the playoffs. In their second year, they continued their development, but again fell short of playoff contention. That year saw their first youth player graduate to the local Lanarkshire Longhorns Junior side. In 2014, they qualified for BritBowl for the first time, travelling down to Doncaster and beating the UK #1 seed in their first game, before losing out in double overtime in the semi-final. In 2015, they again qualified for the Semi Finals and completed their regular season fixtures by beating the dominant Highland Wildcats for the first time in their history.\n\nIn 2016, the Pirates youth team continued to extend their dominance by finishing as overall Scottish Champions, knocking the Highland Wildcats off the top spot for the first time in over five years and qualifying for u17s British Finals in Sheffield on Saturday 3 September. The Pirates went on to sail through each round of the finals, culminating in a championship final win against Cobham Cougars that saw the Pirates take the u17s British Championship title. Jack Cochrane was named as youth BritBowl MVP. The scores were as follows:\n\nQuarter-final \u2013 East Kilbride Pirates 16 v 8 Birmingham Bulls\nSemi-final \u2013 Chester Romans 13 v 25 East Kilbride Pirates\nNational Championship Final: East Kilbride Pirates 37 v 6 Cobham Cougars\n\nThe Pirates Youth made the final again in 2017, this time narrowly losing out to the Cougars.\n\nThe Pirates won their Second youth National Championship in 2018 with running back Mathew Black being the MVP in the final, the results were as follows:\nQuarter-Finals: Kent Exiles 14-26 Pirates, Semi-Finals: Leeds Academy Assassins 13-27 Pirates: National Championship Game: Chorley Buccaneers 22-51 Pirates\n\n'''The Hamilton Buccaneers'''\n\nIn 2012, the Pirates increased their coverage in Lanarkshire by creating a second Youth team, the Hamilton Buccaneers. The Bucs have continued to grow, consistently finishing #3 in the Scottish youth conference, and in 2017 launched the club's first youth flag endeavor.\n\n'''East Kilbride Pirates Junior'''\n\nIn mid 2013, the team announced plans for a Junior team, to compete in the 16\u201319 age range and bridge the gap between Youth and Senior.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=Paul |title=Gridiron: East Kilbride Pirates look to youth for new season |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gridiron-east-kilbride-pirates-look-10155719 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Daily Record |date=4 April 2017}}</ref> They played their first season in 2014 with a small squad, recording 2 wins, however a good graduating class from the two youth teams boosted the 2015 playing squad and the team won two games before finishing their season by winning a friendly against Clackmannanshire Ravens in the off-season after a change of coaching staff once the season had ended. Further additions from the two Youth teams and an expansion of the coaching staff boosted the squad and in 2016 they went on to become Scottish Champions, Northern Champions and British u19s championship runners-up. \n\nIn 2017 the team repeated this achievement, narrowly losing in the British Final to the London Blitz, in the highest scoring Junior final in British history. This made the Pirates the first Scottish team ever to appear in more than one British Championship game. \n\nIn 2018 the junior team went 5-1 in the regular season, and narrowly lost out to Manchester Titans in the semi-final, in a game that went to overtime. The team went on to compete in the National Plate final, winning the championship 46-0 against Herfordshire Cheetahs. \n\nIn 2019, despite having the team's youngest and most inexperienced squad to date, the team finished their regular season 6-0, and won a semi-final 13-9 against Birmingham Lions to qualify for their third appearance at the British U19 final in four years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gridiron-east-kilbride-pirates-junior-19028970|title=Gridiron: East Kilbride Pirates' junior team set sail for national final|last=Thomson|first=Paul|date=2019-08-30|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> The game was streamed by BBC Sport<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/american-football/49542402|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>, and despite strong hopes the Scots were shut out 26-0 against a fast and physical London Blitz junior team. \n\n==Women's teams==\nIn September 2015 the East Kilbride Pirates launched their first women's team.

The season began on April 9, 2007 and concluded on November 4, 2007. It was the tenth and final season in which teams competed for two automatic promotion spots and one playoff spot.\n\nThe 1. divisjon was won by [[Molde FK|Molde]], who finished one point ahead of [[Hamarkameratene|Ham-Kam]]. Both clubs were relegated from the [[Tippeligaen]] in 2006 and were promoted back to the highest level after only one season. [[FK Bod\u00f8/Glimt|Bod\u00f8/Glimt]] finished third and defeated [[Odd Grenland]] in the playoff to earn promotion.\n\nOf the four teams promoted from the [[2. divisjon]] in 2006, only [[Notodden FK|Notodden]] managed to hold on to their spot. They played in the 1. divisjon for the first time in their history, finishing in ninth place ([[SK Sn\u00f8gg|Sn\u00f8gg]] and [[Heddal IL|Heddal]], the club's predecessors, have both played in the second tier, last in [[1967 in Norwegian football|1967]] and [[1961 in Norwegian football|1961]] respectively).\n\n[[Raufoss IL|Raufoss]] returned to the 1. divisjon after being relegated in 2004 and were able to finish in eleventh place. However, due to financial problems and failure to meet demands on infrastructure, the [[Football Association of Norway]] decided not to award Raufoss the required license for play in the top two divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotball.no/table.asp?p=53186&cat=51834&x=1&a=211775&TournamentId=277213 |title=Club licenses for 2008 |work=Football Association of Norway |accessdate=2007-12-11 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotball.no/table.asp?p=53186&cat=51834&x=1&a=213663&TournamentId=277213 |title=Raufoss' appeal dismissed |work=Football Association of Norway |accessdate=2007-12-11 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Raufoss were demoted to the 2. divisjon and their place given to [[FK Sparta Sarpsborg|Sparta Sarpsborg]], who finished in thirteenth place.\n\n[[FK Mandalskameratene|Mandalskameratene]] and [[Skeid Fotball|Skeid]] were relegated to the 2. divisjon after one season.

The season began on April 9, 2007 and concluded on November 4, 2007. It was the tenth and final season in which teams competed for two automatic promotion spots and one playoff spot.\n\nThe 1. divisjon was won by [[Molde FK|Molde]], who finished one point ahead of [[Hamarkameratene|Ham-Kam]]. Both clubs were relegated from the [[Tippeligaen]] in 2006 and were promoted back to the highest level after only one season. [[FK Bod\u00f8/Glimt|Bod\u00f8/Glimt]] finished third and defeated [[Odd Grenland]] in the playoff to earn promotion.\n\nOf the four teams promoted from the [[2. divisjon]] in 2006, only [[Notodden FK|Notodden]] managed to hold on to their spot. They played in the 1. divisjon for the first time in their history, finishing in ninth place ([[SK Sn\u00f8gg|Sn\u00f8gg]] and [[Heddal IL|Heddal]], the club's predecessors, have both played in the second tier, last in [[1967 in Norwegian football|1967]] and [[1961 in Norwegian football|1961]] respectively).\n\n[[Raufoss IL|Raufoss]] returned to the 1. divisjon after being relegated in 2004 and were able to finish in eleventh place. However, due to financial problems and failure to meet demands on infrastructure, the [[Football Association of Norway]] decided not to award Raufoss the required license for play in the top two divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotball.no/table.asp?p=53186&cat=51834&x=1&a=211775&TournamentId=277213 |title=Club licenses for 2008 |work=Football Association of Norway |accessdate=2007-12-11 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotball.no/table.asp?p=53186&cat=51834&x=1&a=213663&TournamentId=277213 |title=Raufoss' appeal dismissed |work=Football Association of Norway |accessdate=2007-12-11 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Raufoss were demoted to the 2. divisjon and their place given to [[FK Sparta Sarpsborg|Sparta Sarpsborg]], who finished in thirteenth place.\n\n[[FK Mandalskameratene|Mandalskameratene]] and [[Skeid Fotball|Skeid]] were relegated to the 2. divisjon after one season.

The song was produced by Musical D and Nick Cage and is the first single released from his fifth studio album. It was announced on that \"Scream\" would serve as one of the official songs for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]].\n\n==Background==\nIt was announced on 25 July 2012 that the song would serve as one of five official tracks for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]]. The song had been demo-ed by [[Teriy Keys|Smurfie Syco]] before finally featuring vocals from Pepper, who has performed with him a handful of times following their first collaboration at last year's V Festival. Pepper was signed to his Dirtee Skank record label after she was discovered on [[Must Be the Music (TV series)|Must Be the Music]], where Dizzee appeared as a vocal judge.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/music/906219-dizzee-rascal-for-official-london-2012-olympics-soundtrack-with-scream Dizzee Rascal for official London 2012 Olympics soundtrack with Scream]</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on 26 July 2012 at a length of two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZhS_l8c6n8 Dizzee Rascal ft Pepper - Scream (Online Video Exclusive)]. [[YouTube]]</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nRobert Copsey of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song a mixed review stating:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I feel like Rocky on the steps/ I could have drowned in the blood and the sweat,\" he insists over punchy beats, swooping strings and twinky electro-swizzles, his flow still packing a considerable punch. As with most sports songs this summer it's not the most lyrically adventurous (\"Scream it from your heart/ Feel it from your soul,\" guest star Pepper sings on the chorus), but as a rousing stadium-filler, it does the job nicely. {{rating|3|5}}.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a396670/dizzee-rascal-ft-pepper-scream-single-review.html Dizzee Rascal ft.

As with most sports songs this summer it's not the most lyrically adventurous (\"Scream it from your heart/ Feel it from your soul,\" guest star Pepper sings on the chorus), but as a rousing stadium-filler, it does the job nicely. {{rating|3|5}}.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a396670/dizzee-rascal-ft-pepper-scream-single-review.html Dizzee Rascal ft.

She is the second Polish female composer to have achieved national and international recognition, the first being [[Maria Szymanowska]] in the early 19th century.\n\n== Life ==\nBacewicz was born in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].  Her father and her brother [[Vytautas Bacevi\u010dius|Vytautas]], also a composer, identified as Lithuanian and used the last name Bacevi\u010dius; her other brother Kiejstut identified as Polish. Her father, Wincenty Bacewicz, gave Gra\u017cyna her first piano and violin lessons {{harv|Anon.|2014}}.  In 1928 she began studying at the [[Warsaw Conservatory]], where she studied violin with J\u00f3zef Jarz\u0119bski and piano with [[J\u00f3zef Turczy\u0144ski]], and composition with [[Kazimierz Sikorski]], graduating in 1932 as a violinist and composer {{harv|Thomas|2001}}. She continued her education in [[Paris]], having been granted a stipend by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] to attend the [[\u00c9cole Normale de Musique]] {{harv|Anon. 2014}}, and studied there in 1932\u201333 with [[Nadia Boulanger]] (composition) and Andr\u00e9 Touret (violin). She returned briefly to Poland to teach in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, but returned to Paris in 1934 in order to study with the Hungarian violinist [[Carl Flesch]] {{harv|Thomas|2001}}.\n\nAfter completing her studies, Bacewicz took part in numerous events as a soloist, composer, and jury member. From 1936 to 1938 she was the principal violinist of the Polish Radio Orchestra, which was directed then by [[Grzegorz Fitelberg]] {{harv|Thomas|2001}}. This position gave her the chance to hear much of her own music. During [[World War II]], Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz lived in [[Warsaw]]. She continued to compose, and gave underground secret concerts (premiering her Suite for Two Violins) {{harv|Lein|2008}}.\n\nBacewicz also dedicated time to family life.

She continued to compose, and gave underground secret concerts (premiering her Suite for Two Violins) {{harv|Lein|2008}}.\n\nBacewicz also dedicated time to family life. She was married in 1936, and gave birth to a daughter, {{Interlanguage link multi|Alina Biernacka|pl}}, a recognized painter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}<!--The citation at the end of the paragraph verifies only the final sentence.--> Following the Warsaw uprising they escaped the destroyed city and temporarily settled in Lublin {{harv|Bacewicz|n.d.|loc=1}}.\n\nAfter the war, she took up the position of professor at the [[Academy of Music in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a|State Conservatoire of Music in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. At this time she was shifting her musical activity towards composition, drawn by her many awards and commissions.
