After the death of his first wife Anna Maria Pinhak (1814\u20131850), he married Louise Lobmeyr (1832\u20131905) on 28 May 1851. Mathilde was the fourth of five children from his second marriage to Louise n\u00e9e Lobmeyr. Her brother was [[:de:Richard Kralik|Richard Kralik von Meyrswalden]], the poet philosopher, historian and arts administrator.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&pg=PA254&dq=Mathilde+Kralik+Norton+grove&hl=en&ei=xZbbTNL4D4Kr8AbXpv33CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=4 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nKralik was born in [[Linz]], and her first compositions were lyrical poems and hymns based on her brother's works. The family regularly had music in the house, as her father William played the violin and her mother Louise played piano. In this way the musically gifted children not only learned the milieu of classical chamber music, but also string orchestra furnished music of the time by [[Haydn]], [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]]. Early on the parents recognized the musical gifts of their daughter, and the financial circumstances of her father allowed Mathilde the best music teachers of her time.\n\nKralik took piano lessons from her mother, and later was a pupil of [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Franz Krenn]] and [[Julius Epstein (pianist)|Julius Epstein]]. She passed the 1876 entrance examination for the Conservatory of the Society of Friends of Music, and studied at the Conservatory from 1876 to 1878. She won the second prize for a ''Scherzo for piano quintet'' and received first prize for her thesis, ''Intermezzo from a suite''. Kralik graduated from the conservatory with a diploma in composition and the Silver Society Medal.\n\n==Career==\nKralik's works became popular in the concert scene of Austria. On 19 April 1894 and on 19 April 1895, her compositions were performed at the Brahms-Saal of the Musikverein place. In the 1898/99 season, the Quartet Duesberg presented her 1880 composed ''Piano Trio in F Major'' (1880). Josef Venantius von W\u00f6ss on 12 January 1900 hosted a concert in the Great Hall of the Musikverein where Matilda book ''The Baptism of Christ'' after a poem by Pope Leo XIII was presented. Her ''Christmas Cantata'' for solo, choir and orchestra was also staged. On 20 March 1908 in the Brahms-Saal, a concert included four songs and arias from her fairy-tale opera ''Blume and Weissblume''.\n\nMathilde was Honorary President of the Women's Choir Association [[Vienna]], and a member of the Vienna Bach community, the Austrian Composers, the Association of Writers and Artists Club of Vienna and the Viennese Musicians.\n\nIn October 1905, her mother Louise died at age 74. The death of her mother affected Kralik and her work stagnated for half a year. From 1912 onward she lived in their home alone until she took an apartment with Dr. Alice Scarlat (1882\u20131959) in Vienna.\n\nThe opera ''Blume und Weissblume'' was presented in 1910 in [[Hagen]], [[Westphalia]], and in 1912 in [[Bielsko]], and was popular not only because of these two performances, but also because of sensationalist coverage in the press. The former [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar [[Nicasius Schusser]] had written an opera ''[[Quo Vadis]]'', in which he took 52 pages from Kralik's opera note for note. Mathilde responded in the press, but gave up legal action against Schusser. After [[World War I]] the popularity of Kralik's work declined, and she died 8 March 1944 in Vienna.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kralik von Meyrswalden, Rochus|title=''Ein Kuss von Franz Liszt''|publisher=ACABUS Verlag Hamburg|year=2009|ISBN=978-3-941404-02-1}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nSelected works include:\n\nSong with instrumental accompaniment:\n*Autumn feeling, JW von Goethe text, 1892\n*Fantasia in E minor (voice, piano, violin), Kurt Erich Rotter text of dying dreams, 1928\n\nSong with piano:\n*Litany of Loreto, words by brother Richard, 1898\n*The rosary, words by brother, Richard, 1898\n*The love bridge, ballad, words by brother, Richard, 1896\n*Empress Zita song, text by Heinrich Ritter Turzansky, 1918\n*Vivat Austria, text Josef von Eichendorff, 1908\n*Dragoon song, text Theodor Lehnstorff, 1914\n\nOpera:\n*Blume und Weissblume, fairy play in three acts.

Kralik graduated from the conservatory with a diploma in composition and the Silver Society Medal.\n\n==Career==\nKralik's works became popular in the concert scene of Austria. On 19 April 1894 and on 19 April 1895, her compositions were performed at the Brahms-Saal of the Musikverein place. In the 1989/99 season, the Quartet Duesberg presented her 1880 composed ''Piano Trio in F Major'' (1880). Josef Venantius von W\u00f6ss on 12 January 1900 hosted a concert in the Great Hall of the Musikverein where Matilda book ''The Baptism of Christ'' after a poem by Pope Leo XIII was presented. Her ''Christmas Cantata'' for solo, choir and orchestra was also staged. On 20 March 1908 in the Brahms-Saal, a concert included four songs and arias from her fairy-tale opera ''Blume and Weissblume''.\n\nMathilde was Honorary President of the Women's Choir Association [[Vienna]], and a member of the Vienna Bach community, the Austrian Composers, the Association of Writers and Artists Club of Vienna and the Viennese Musicians.\n\nIn October 1905, her mother Louise died at age 74. The death of her mother affected Kralik and her work stagnated for half a year. From 1912 onward she lived in their home alone until she took an apartment with Dr. Alice Scarlat (1882\u20131959) in Vienna.\n\nThe opera ''Blume und Weissblume'' was presented in 1910 in [[Hagen]], [[Westphalia]], and in 1912 in [[Bielsko]], and was popular not only because of these two performances, but also because of sensationalist coverage in the press. The former [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar [[Nicasius Schusser]] had written an opera ''[[Quo Vadis]]'', in which he took 52 pages from Kralik's opera note for note. Mathilde responded in the press, but gave up legal action against Schusser. After [[World War I]] the popularity of Kralik's work declined, and she died 8 March 1944 in Vienna.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kralik von Meyrswalden, Rochus|title=''Ein Kuss von Franz Liszt''|publisher=ACABUS Verlag Hamburg|year=2009|ISBN=978-3-941404-02-1}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nSelected works include:\n\nSong with instrumental accompaniment:\n*Autumn feeling, JW von Goethe text, 1892\n*Fantasia in E minor (voice, piano, violin), Kurt Erich Rotter text of dying dreams, 1928\n\nSong with piano:\n*Litany of Loreto, words by brother Richard, 1898\n*The rosary, words by brother, Richard, 1898\n*The love bridge, ballad, words by brother, Richard, 1896\n*Empress Zita song, text by Heinrich Ritter Turzansky, 1918\n*Vivat Austria, text Josef von Eichendorff, 1908\n*Dragoon song, text Theodor Lehnstorff, 1914\n\nOpera:\n*Blume und Weissblume, fairy play in three acts.

The show starred [[Umesh Kamat]] and [[Urmila Kanetkar]] in lead roles. It was well received by the audience. It received various awards and gained popularity. It was popular mainly because of its genre. The serial is based on the popular concept of re-incarnation in Hindu culture. The drama revolved around the cast which were presented as the rebirths of the past life and the dramatic events that occurred in their lives. This serial had Umesh Kamat, [[Urmila Kanetkar]], [[Neelam Shirke|Neelam Shirke- Kulkarni]], Anand Abhyankar in leading roles with screenplay/writer [[Chinmay Mandlekar]] and was directed by Satish Rajwade for most of its two-year run.\n\n==Plot==\nA young woman remembers the wrongs done to her in her past life and takes rebirth to avenge herself. As her mission unfolds, many secrets of the past are unveiled. Adinath Shastri ([[Umesh Kamat]]), the second child of Madhusudan Shastri returns to India from the US for a sabbatical and plans to marry Sulekha ([[Neelam Shirke|Neelam Shirke-Kulkarni]]) who is his aunt's ([[Sulekha Talwalkar]]) sister. They fall in love over the Internet and plan to marry as soon as he comes back and has plans to go back to the US with her. Adinath and Sulekha get engaged and plan to get married soon. However, fate takes an unexpected twist when he travels to Konkan for work and accidentally meets Shubhra ([[Urmila Kanetkar]]) after he meets with an accident. Shubhra lives with her mother and is supposed to get married soon to a person named Ramakant Khot. She nurses Adinath back to health and congratulates him on his engagement. Adinath is surprised as he does not remember telling Shubhra about it, to which she replies that she had a vision in which she saw him getting engaged. Adinath is taken by surprise. As a few days pass by Shubhra and Adinath spend time together and get married without any plans. They return to the \"Wada\" (ancestral mansion) in [[Vasai]] (near [[Mumbai]]) on the day he was supposed to get married to Sulekha, where his family members are in full swing with the marriage preparations. He introduces Shubhra as his wife to which everyone reacts in an atrocious manner. Sulekha is heartbroken and fumes at Adinath and Shubhra. Initially, the family members reject his decision but later accept Shubhra. \nAdinath's grandfather- Dinanath Shastri ([[Anand Abhyankar]]) says that Shubra has a striking resemblance to his sister-in-law  Parvati Vahini who mysteriously disappeared about six decades ago. He welcomes Shubhra and regards her as the reincarnation of Parvati. That night, an old man by the name of Sopan (who used to be the servant at the Wada 60\u201370 years ago and now lived in the outhouse of the Wada) mysteriously disappears and later confronts Sulekha. At first, Sulekha doesn\u2019t pay any heed to him until he addresses her as Indumati and later explains to her that she is \"his Indumati\" who died mysteriously when he was young. (Here it is implied that Sulekha is, in fact, a reincarnation of Indumati, the antagonist) Sopan presents her with an ugly figurine that of a woman playing tambourine (later revealed to be the Idol of Fire Force used in Black Magic) and says that the figurine will help her regain her memories of past life and give her the strength to finish the goal which she had vowed then. And returns to Wada. In the meantime, at the Shastri's, things go on in a mundane way until Shubra has visions again where she sees a black car hitting a teenage boy, although she doesn\u2019t know who the boy is. She has the visions repeatedly but Adinath doesn\u2019t take it seriously. Later Shubra has a vision of the outhouse being set on fire and warns Adinath about it. A day later the outhouse really has a fire accident and Sopan escapes and takes refuge at Sulekha's house. Everyone considers Sopan as dead. Adinath's nephew (Chandu's son) Prathamesh is mute but he mumbles and addresses Shubhra as Parvati even though no one tells him about her. He becomes friends with Shubra and both of them have a good understanding among themselves. Prathamesh behaves in a strange fashion and sketches all the visions Shubra has although no one tells him anything. Later on, it is revealed that Prathamesh is a re-incarnation of Goda (Indumati's younger sister), a timid but good maid who used to work at the Wada when Parvati existed. It is also revealed that Adinath is, in fact, the reincarnation of Mahadev Shastri (Parvati's husband, Dinanath's elder brother) and hence fate brought Shubhra and Adinath (past life's Parvati and Mahadev) together under mystical circumstances and got them married as strangers.\nAdinath's sister Priya Shastri (Sharvari Patankar) has an unexplained resent towards Sulekha from the time Adinath introduces her to his family. As the story progresses, the visions seen by Shubhra come true. The boy seen by Shubhra is, in fact, Nikhil Shastri (Sulekha's nephew and Adinath's cousin) who is hit by the black car. (Sulekha hypnotizes Nikhil and hence causes the accident) and in a similar way brings about the death of her own mother (Meena Naik), Kshipra (Sujata Joshi), BalKrishna Shastri (her brother-in-law, Nikhil's father).\n\nShubra and Adinath consult a neurophysiologist Dr. Samant (Sunil Barve) to regain the memories of their past life while in parallel Sulekha consults a lady by the name Tanishka (Manjusha Godse-Datar) to learn the art of mind control and hypnosis more profoundly. Dr. Samant is shown to be the reincarnation of Shrirang Ranade(Mahadev's Best friend). Both Sulekha and Shubra dive into their past birth and the story unfolds that Parvati and Mahdev were once a happy couple but did not have any children and Parvati was a staunch believer of Lord Shri Krishna and plans to name her children after the names of Krishna (which unfortunately never happens). Dinanath Shstri hence fulfills her wish with his own children (Hence the names Madhusudan Shastri (Adinath's father), BalKrishna Shastri)\n\nMeanwhile, in the village of Vasai two sisters, Goda and Indumati, arrive. Bhalchandra the brother-in-law of Mahadev has an extra marital affair with Indumati which when discovered infuriates the patriarch of the Shastri family (Mahadev's father) and he humiliates Indumati in front of the entire village by applying back color on her face and making her ride a donkey.\nSimultaneously a person by the name Shrirang Ranade comes to the Wada and Mahadev takes to the misunderstanding (thanks to Bhalchandra) that there is something going on between Parvati and him (Shrirang) and banishes Parvati from the Wada.\nIndumati (present day's Sulekha) then vows that she would destroy the Shastri family and uses black magic and kills everyone from Shastri family except young Dinanath Shastri (who is saved at the last moment by Parvati) and in the process, she, Indumati and Goda are buried alive in a landslide in the underground passage way near the wada. Since the story of revenge remains incomplete in the past birth, Indumati, Parvati, Goda, Mahadev and other characters take rebirth and finish the incomplete vows.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkkG_Vcqp-U |title=Zee Marathi Show |author=Zee Marathi |publisher=Zee Marathi |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and Characters==\n* [[Umesh Kamat]] as Adinath Shastri/Mahadev Shastri:<br/>The male lead.

(Sulekha hypnotizes Nikhil and hence causes the accident) and in a similar way brings about the death of her own mother (Meena Naik), Kshipra (Sujata Joshi), BalKrishna Shastri (her brother in law, Nikhil's Father).\nShubra and Adinath consult a neurophysiologist Dr. Samant (Sunil Barve) to regain the memories of their past life while in parallel Sulekha consults a lady by the name Tanishka (Manjusha Godse-Datar) to learn the art of mind control and hypnosis more profoundly. Dr. Samant is shown to be the reincarnation of Shrirang Ranade(Mahadev's Best friend). Both Sulekha and Shubra dive into their past birth and the story unfolds that Parvati and Mahdev were once a happy couple but did not have any children and Parvati was a staunch believer of Lord Shri Krishna and plans to name her children after the names of Krishna (which unfortunately never happens). Dinanath Shstri hence fulfills her wish with his own children (Hence the names Madhusudan Shastri (Adinath's father), BalKrishna Shastri)\nWhile at around that time in the village of Vasai came two sisters: Goda and Indumati. Bhalchandra the brother in law of Mahadev has an extra marital affair with Indumati which when discovered infuriates the patriarch of the Shastri Family (Mahadev's father) and he humiliates Indumati in front of the entire village by applying back color on her face and making her ride a donkey.\nSimultaneously a person by the name Shrirang Ranade comes to the Wada and Mahadev takes to the misunderstanding(Thanks to Bhalchandra) that there is something going on between Parvati and him (Shrirang) and banishes Parvati from the Wada.\nIndumati (present day's Sulekha) then vowes that she would destroy the Shastri family and uses black magic and kills everyone from Shastri family except young Dinanath Shastri (who is saved at the last moment by Parvati) and in the process, she, Indumati and Goda are buried alive in a landslide in the underground passage way near the wada. Since the story of revenge remains incomplete in the past birth, Indumati, Parvati, Goda, Mahadev and other characters take rebirth and finish the incomplete vows.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkkG_Vcqp-U |title=Zee Marathi Show |author=Zee Marathi |publisher=Zee Marathi |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and Characters==\n* [[Umesh Kamat]] as Adinath Shastri/Mahadev Shastri:<br/>The male lead.

There were eighteen official and unofficial entrants; fifteen of those drew for starting positions, and of those fifteen, two were disqualified, two withdrew, and three aircraft crashed before the race, resulting in three deaths. Eight aircraft eventually participated in the start of the race on August 16, with only two successfully arriving in Hawaii; ''Woolaroc'', a [[Travel Air 5000]] piloted by [[Arthur C. Goebel]] and [[William V. Davis]], arrived after a 26&#188;-hour flight, leading runner-up ''Aloha'' by two hours.\n\nOf the unsuccessful six aircraft, two crashed on takeoff, two were forced to return for repairs, and two went missing during the race (''Golden Eagle'' and ''Miss Doran''). One of the aircraft that was repaired took off again to search for the missing aircraft several days later and also vanished over the sea (''Dallas Spirit''). In all, before, during, and after the race, ten lives were lost and six airplanes were lost or damaged beyond repair.\n\n==The Dole prize==\n[[File:James Drummond Dole.jpg|thumb|upright|James D Dole]]\nInspired by [[Charles A.

There were eighteen official and unofficial entrants; fifteen of those drew for starting positions, and of those fifteen, two were disqualified, two withdrew, and three aircraft crashed before the race, resulting in three deaths. Eight aircraft eventually participated in the start of the race on August 16, with only two successfully arriving in Hawaii; ''Woolaroc'', a [[Travel Air 5000]] piloted by [[Arthur C. Goebel]] and [[William V. Davis]], arrived after a 26&#188;-hour flight, leading runner-up ''Aloha'' by two hours.\n\nOf the unsuccessful six aircraft, two crashed on takeoff, two were forced to return for repairs, and two went missing during the race (''Golden Eagle'' and ''Miss Doran''). One of the aircraft that was repaired took off again to search for the missing aircraft several days later and also vanished over the sea (''Dallas Spirit''). In all, before, during, and after the race, ten lives were lost and six airplanes were lost or damaged beyond repair.\n\n==The Dole prize==\n[[File:James Drummond Dole.jpg|thumb|upright|James D Dole]]\nInspired by [[Charles A.

The film is a \"dark psychological drama\" focusing on events in a wintry [[Scotland|Scottish]] Highland regimental barracks in the period following the [[Second World War]].<ref name=tcmart>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94056&category=Articles|title=Tunes of Glory|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> It stars [[Alec Guinness]] and [[John Mills]], and features [[Dennis Price]], [[Kay Walsh]], [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]], [[Susannah York]], [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan MacRae]] and [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]].\n\nWriter Kennaway served with the [[Gordon Highlanders]], and the title refers to the [[bagpipes|bagpiping]] that accompanies every important action of the regiment. The original pipe music was composed by [[Malcolm Arnold]], who also wrote the music for ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.<ref name=tcmart /> The film was generally well received by critics, the acting in particular garnering praise. Kennaway's [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|screenplay]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in an officers' [[mess#United Kingdom|mess]] of an unnamed Highland Regiment in the early post-[[World War II]] era. Acting Lieutenant Colonel Jock Sinclair ([[Alec Guinness]]) announces this will be his last day as [[Commanding Officer#Army|commanding officer]]. The hard-drinking Sinclair, who is still gazetted as a Major despite being in command since the battalion's last full colonel was killed in action during the [[North African campaign]] of the [[Second World War]], is to be replaced by the teetotal [[Lieutenant Colonel]], Basil Barrow ([[John Mills]]). Although Sinclair led the battalion through the remainder of the war, winning a DSO and MM medals during [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]], and \"from Dover to Berlin\",  Brigade HQ considers Barrow a more appropriate peacetime commanding officer. A drunken Sinclair reveals his frustrations at his lowly rank versus Barrow: \"I've acted Colonel, I should be Colonel, and by God... I will be Colonel!\"     \n\nColonel Barrow arrives early and observes the battalion's officers dancing rowdily, including Major Sinclair. Barrow and Sinclair icily swap their military backgrounds. Sinclair joined the regiment as an enlisted bandsman in Glasgow and rose through the ranks, winning the [[Military Medal]] and [[Distinguished Service Order]] during the war. Barrow by contrast came to the regiment from [[Eton College|Eton]] then [[Oxford University]], both in England, and that his ancestors were colonels of the regiment before him \u2013 although Barrow served only a year with the regiment back in 1933 before being posted to \"special duties\", including lecturing at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. He has been fifteen years away from the battalion. When Sinclair humorously recounts he was briefly in [[Barlinnie (HM Prison)|Barlinnie Prison]] for being [[drunk and disorderly]] (also in 1933), Barrow reticently mentions his experience as a prisoner in a [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese POW camp]]. Sinclair dismissively assumes Barrow received preferential treatment as an officer (\"officer's privileges and amateur theatricals\") but in fact Barrow is deeply psychologically scarred after being tortured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]], which he does not tell Sinclair who not-so-privately resents his replacement by a \"stupid wee man\".\n\nMeanwhile, Morag ([[Susannah York]]), Sinclair's daughter, is observed illicitly meeting an enlisted [[bagpipes|piper]] (John Fraser).\n\nBarrow immediately passes several orders designed to instil discipline in the battalion that Sinclair had allowed to slip. Particularly controversial is an order that all officers take lessons in [[Highland dancing]] in an effort to make their customary rowdy style more formal and suitable for mixed company. However the unchanged energetic dancing of the officers, led by a drunken Sinclair at Barrow's first cocktail party with the townspeople, incites his anger. An outburst by Barrow only further damages his own authority.\n\nTensions come to a head when Major Sinclair publicly assaults the uniformed piper he discovers with his daughter in a pub &ndash; \"bashing a [[Corporal#United Kingdom|corporal]]\" as he put it. Barrow decides an official report to the Brigade must be made, meaning an imminent [[court-martial]], even though he is aware the action will further erode his popularity and authority within the battalion. Barrow is eventually persuaded to back down by Sinclair, who promises Barrow that he will support him in the future (\"We'd make a good team.\"). The decision further undermines his authority, as Sinclair's promised support never materializes, and the other officers, notably Captain Alec Rattray ([[Richard Leech]]), treat him with a renewed lack of respect. The second in command, Major Charlie Scott, with glacial cruelty, implies that it is Sinclair who is really running the battalion, because he forced Barrow to dismiss the charges against him. Alienated now from both Sinclair's clique and the officers who formerly supported him, Barrow commits suicide with a revolver.\n\nWith the colonel's death, Sinclair realises he is to blame. He calls the officers to a meeting and announces plans for a grandiose funeral fit for a [[field marshal]], complete with a march through the town in which all the \"tunes of glory\" will be played by the pipers. When it is pointed out how out disproportionate the plans are to the circumstances, especially given the manner of the colonel's death, Sinclair insists that it was not suicide but murder. He tells everyone he himself was the murderer and the other senior officers were his accomplices with the exception of the colonel's adjutant.\n\nSinclair suffers a [[nervous breakdown]] and is escorted from the barracks while the officers and men salute as he passes during the closing scene.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as Major Jock Sinclair, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Medal|MM]]\n* [[John Mills]] as Lieutenant Colonel Basil Barrow\n* [[Dennis Price]] as Major Charles Scott, [[Military Cross|MC & Bar]]\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as Mary Titterington\n* [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]] as Corporal Piper Ian Fraser\n* [[Susannah York]] as Morag Sinclair\n* [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Captain Jimmy Cairns, MC\n* [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan MacRae]] as [[Pipe Major]] Maclean\n* [[Percy Herbert (actor)|Percy Herbert]] as [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] Riddick\n* [[Allan Cuthbertson]] as Captain Eric Simpson\n* [[Paul Whitsun-Jones]] as Major 'Dusty' Miller\n* [[Gerald Harper]] as Major Hugo MacMillan\n* [[Richard Leech]] as Captain Alec Rattray\n* [[Peter McEnery]] as 2nd Lieutenant David MacKinnon\n* [[Keith Faulkner]] as Corporal Piper Adam\n* [[Angus Lennie]] as Orderly Room Clerk\n* [[John Harvey (actor)|John Harvey]] as Sergeant Finney\n* [[Andrew Keir]] as Lance Corporal Campbell\n* [[Jameson Clark]] as Sir Alan\n* [[Lockwood West]] as Provost\n{{colend}}\n;Cast notes\n* According to an article in the ''[[New York Times]]''<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94056&category=Notes Notes], which cites the date of the ''[[New York Times]]'' article as 2 October 1960</ref> Alec Guinness wanted to play the role of Barrow, and John Mills wanted to play Sinclair &ndash; both initially turned down the film for those reasons. It took a meeting between Guinness, Mills and director [[Ronald Neame]] to straighten out why each was best suited for the role they had been offered.<ref>Robert Osborne, on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] broadcast of ''Tunes of Glory'' (2 February 2009).</ref> However, in his autobiography, John Mills claimed that he brought the script to Guinness, and between them they decided who should play which role.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Guinness believed this performance to be among his best.\n* ''Tunes of Glory'' was Susannah York's film debut.

Establishing location shots were done at [[Stirling Castle]] in [[Stirling]], Scotland. Stirling Castle is the Regimental Headquarters of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]<ref name=tcmnotes /> but in fact James Kennaway served with the [[Gordon Highlanders]]. Although the production was initially offered broad co-operation to film within the castle from the commanding officer there, as long as it didn't disrupt the regiment's [Argyll's] routine, after seeing a lurid paperback cover for Kennaway's book, that co-operation evaporated, and the production was only allowed to shoot distant exterior shots of the castle.<ref name=tcmart />\n\nDirector [[Ronald Neame]] worked with Guinness on ''[[The Horse's Mouth (film)|The Horse's Mouth]]'' (1958), and a number of other participants were also involved in both films, including actress Kay Walsh, cinematographer [[Arthur Ibbetson]] and editor [[Anne V. Coates]].<ref name=tcmart />\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was praised by [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who wrote \"Not only do Alec Guinness and John Mills superlatively adorn the two top roles in this drama of professional military men, but also every actor, down to the walk-ons, acquits himself handsomely.\"<ref name=\"Crowther\">{{cite news |last1=Crowther |first1=Bosley |title=Guinness and Mills Star in 'Tunes of Glory' |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/24/reviews/guinness-tunes.html |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=21 December 1960}}</ref>\n\n[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] called Ronald Neame\u2019s direction \"crisp and vigorous,\" and said that Mills had a \"tough assignment\" to appear opposite Guinness, \"particularly in a fundamentally unsympathetic role, but he is always a match for his co-star.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Variety Staff |first1= |last2= |first2= |title=Tunes of Glory |url=https://variety.com/1959/film/reviews/tunes-of-glory-1200419524/ |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=Variety |date=1 January 1960 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film has a 73% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tunes of Glory (1960) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tunes_of_glory |accessdate=12 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nJames Kennaway, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], but lost to ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]''.

The film is a \"dark psychological drama\" focusing on events in a wintry [[Scotland|Scottish]] Highland regimental barracks in the period following the [[Second World War]].<ref name=tcmart>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94056&category=Articles|title=Tunes of Glory|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> It stars [[Alec Guinness]] and [[John Mills]], and features [[Dennis Price]], [[Kay Walsh]], [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]], [[Susannah York]], [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan MacRae]] and [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]].\n\nWriter Kennaway served with the [[Gordon Highlanders]], and the title refers to the [[bagpipes|bagpiping]] that accompanies every important action of the regiment. The original pipe music was composed by [[Malcolm Arnold]], who also wrote the music for ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.<ref name=tcmart /> The film was generally well received by critics, the acting in particular garnering praise. Kennaway's [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|screenplay]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in an officers' [[mess#United Kingdom|mess]] of an unnamed Highland Regiment in the early post-[[World War II]] era. Acting Lieutenant Colonel Jock Sinclair ([[Alec Guinness]]) announces this will be his last day as [[Commanding Officer#Army|commanding officer]]. The hard-drinking Sinclair, who is still gazetted as a Major despite being in command since the battalion's last full colonel was killed in action during the [[North African campaign]] of the [[Second World War]], is to be replaced by the teetotal [[Lieutenant Colonel]], Basil Barrow ([[John Mills]]). Although Sinclair led the battalion through the remainder of the war, winning a DSO and MM medals during [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]], and \"from Dover to Berlin\",  Brigade HQ considers Barrow a more appropriate peacetime commanding officer. A drunken Sinclair reveals his frustrations at his lowly rank versus Barrow: \"I've acted Colonel, I should be Colonel, and by God... I will be Colonel!\"     \n\nColonel Barrow arrives early and observes the battalion's officers dancing rowdily, including Major Sinclair. Barrow and Sinclair icily swap their military backgrounds. Sinclair joined the regiment as an enlisted bandsman in Glasgow and rose through the ranks, winning the [[Military Medal]] and [[Distinguished Service Order]] during the war. Barrow by contrast came to the regiment from [[Eton College|Eton]] then [[Oxford University]], both in England, and that his ancestors were colonels of the regiment before him \u2013 although Barrow served only a year with the regiment back in 1933 before being posted to \"special duties\", including lecturing at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. He has been fifteen years away from the battalion. When Sinclair humorously recounts he was briefly in [[Barlinnie (HM Prison)|Barlinnie Prison]] for being [[drunk and disorderly]] (also in 1933), Barrow reticently mentions his experience as a prisoner in a [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese POW camp]]. Sinclair dismissively assumes Barrow received preferential treatment as an officer (\"officer's privileges and amateur theatricals\") but in fact Barrow is deeply psychologically scarred after being tortured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]], which he does not tell Sinclair who not-so-privately resents his replacement by a \"stupid wee man\".\n\nMeanwhile, Morag ([[Susannah York]]), Sinclair's daughter, is observed illicitly meeting an enlisted [[bagpipes|piper]] (John Fraser).\n\nBarrow immediately passes several orders designed to instil discipline in the battalion that Sinclair had allowed to slip. Particularly controversial is an order that all officers take lessons in [[Highland dancing]] in an effort to make their customary rowdy style more formal and suitable for mixed company. However the unchanged energetic dancing of the officers, led by a drunken Sinclair at Barrow's first cocktail party with the townspeople, incites his anger. An outburst by Barrow only further damages his own authority.\n\nTensions come to a head when Major Sinclair publicly assaults the uniformed piper he discovers with his daughter in a pub &ndash; \"bashing a [[Corporal#United Kingdom|corporal]]\" as he put it. Barrow decides an official report to the Brigade must be made, meaning an imminent [[court-martial]], even though he is aware the action will further erode his popularity and authority within the battalion. Barrow is eventually persuaded to back down by Sinclair, who promises Barrow that he will support him in the future (\"We'd make a good team.\"). The decision further undermines his authority, as Sinclair's promised support never materializes, and the other officers, notably Captain Alec Rattray ([[Richard Leech]]), treat him with a renewed lack of respect. The second in command, Major Charlie Scott, with glacial cruelty, implies that it is Sinclair who is really running the battalion, because he forced Barrow to dismiss the charges against him. Alienated now from both Sinclair's clique and the officers who formerly supported him, Barrow commits suicide with a revolver.\n\nWith the colonel's death, Sinclair realises he is to blame. He calls the officers to a meeting and announces plans for a grandiose funeral fit for a [[field marshal]], complete with a march through the town in which all the \"tunes of glory\" will be played by the pipers. When it is pointed out how out disproportionate the plans are to the circumstances, especially given the manner of the colonel's death, Sinclair insists that it was not suicide but murder. He tells everyone he himself was the murderer and the other senior officers were his accomplices with the exception of the colonel's adjutant.\n\nSinclair suffers a [[nervous breakdown]] and is escorted from the barracks while the officers and men salute as he passes during the closing scene.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as Major Jock Sinclair, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Medal|MM]]\n* [[John Mills]] as Lieutenant Colonel Basil Barrow\n* [[Dennis Price]] as Major Charles Scott, [[Military Cross|MC & Bar]]\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as Mary Titterington\n* [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]] as Corporal Piper Ian Fraser\n* [[Susannah York]] as Morag Sinclair\n* [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Captain Jimmy Cairns, MC\n* [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan MacRae]] as [[Pipe Major]] Maclean\n* [[Percy Herbert (actor)|Percy Herbert]] as [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] Riddick\n* [[Allan Cuthbertson]] as Captain Eric Simpson\n* [[Paul Whitsun-Jones]] as Major 'Dusty' Miller\n* [[Gerald Harper]] as Major Hugo MacMillan\n* [[Richard Leech]] as Captain Alec Rattray\n* [[Peter McEnery]] as 2nd Lieutenant David MacKinnon\n* [[Keith Faulkner]] as Corporal Piper Adam\n* [[Angus Lennie]] as Orderly Room Clerk\n* [[John Harvey (actor)|John Harvey]] as Sergeant Finney\n* [[Andrew Keir]] as Lance Corporal Campbell\n* [[Jameson Clark]] as Sir Alan\n* [[Lockwood West]] as Provost\n{{colend}}\n;Cast notes\n* According to an article in the ''[[New York Times]]''<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94056&category=Notes Notes], which cites the date of the ''[[New York Times]]'' article as 2 October 1960</ref> Alec Guinness wanted to play the role of Barrow, and John Mills wanted to play Sinclair &ndash; both initially turned down the film for those reasons.

{"title_page": "Wigwag (flag signals)", "text_new": "[[File:Civil War Signal Corps Kit.jpg|thumb|Wigwag flags, wigwag torches and kerosene canteen, and a signal rocket]]\n'''Wigwag''' (more formally, '''aerial telegraphy''') is an historical form of [[flag signals|flag signaling]] that passes messages by waving a single flag.  It differs from [[flag semaphore]] in that it uses one flag rather than two, and the symbols for each letter are represented by the motion of the flag rather than its position.  The larger flag and its motion allow messages to be read over greater distances than semaphore.  Messages could be sent at night using torches instead of flags.\n\nThe most common code used with wigwag had three motions, only two of which were needed to form letters of the alphabet.  These two were waving the flag, respectively, to the left and right \u2013 the wigwagging motion.  A [[Character (computing)|character]] was formed by sequentially displaying a number of motions (elements).  Like [[Morse code]], the number of elements in each character was not fixed, the most common letters being assigned the shortest codes.  A number of other codes were used at times, some of them with a fixed number of elements and up to four different motions.  Morse code was used with wigwag after it became an international standard.\n\nThe wigwag system was invented in the 1850s by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] who became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively by both sides in the [[American Civil War]] and continued to see use in both America and Europe until the end of the century.  After that, long distance communication was performed by [[electrical telegraphy]], or in some places where the telegraph was not available, by [[heliograph]].\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Wigwag motions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The basic wigwag signaling motions<ref>Myer (1866), plate F</ref>]]\nThe wigwag system consisted of a signalman waving a single large flag or other display device in different motions sequentially.  At night, a lamp on a pole could be used, or over short distances the signalman might hold a small disk.  The usual wigwag code was ternary, that is, there were three different motions (symbols) that could be displayed. However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary.  The third symbol only appeared in [[control character]]s.  The neutral position was the signalman holding the flag vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.<ref>Myer (1866), p. 83</ref>\n\nLike [[Morse code]], the normal wigwag code did not have a fixed length (number of elements) for each [[Character (computing)|character]].  For instance, ''i'' was coded as \"1\", but ''d'' was coded as \"222\".<ref>Wolters, p. 10</ref>  The table shows the commonly used wigwag code and the diagram shows the flag motions.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 68</ref>  It is as defined in the [[General Service Code]] of July 1864 issued to standardize signals of the US Army and Navy.<ref>Raines, p. 13</ref>  Further details of the code and an alternate four-symbol representation are given in {{sectionlink|#Code details}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Wigwag code (General Service Code)\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\nThe notation of the wigwag code was originally defined as \"1\" representing the motion to the left and \"2\" representing the motion to the right.  That is, all occurences of \"1\" and \"2\" are interchanged in the table.  This was changed when the General Service Code was issued.  The thinking was that the motion to the left should be notated with the lowest digit, but as seen through a telescope (the usual method of observing) the image is inverted with left and right interchanged.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 95</ref>  The code tabulated in some modern sources shows this earlier notation with \"1\" and \"2\" interchanged.<ref>eg, Raines, p. 7</ref>\n\nTo open communication, the signalman waves the flag continuously from side to side (the \"attention\" signal) until the receiving station replies with the \"understood\" signal (22.22.22.3).  The transmitting station replies with the \"understood\" signal and proceeds to send the message.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 72</ref>  The elements of a character are performed rapidly without pause between them, only returning the flag to the rest position at the end of the character.<ref>{{multiref|Coe, p. 3|Myer (1866), pp. 53, 80}}</ref>  The US Army ''Manual of Signals'' lists several alternative codes, including a three-element fixed-length code using four symbols (1866 edition), and a three-element fixed-length code using three symbols (1872 edition). There is no indication in the manual that these codes were actually in use.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 97|Myer (1872), p. 96}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wigwag flag colours.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Available colors for wigwag flags]]\nWigwag has an advantage over [[flag semaphore]] in that only one flag is used instead of two.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref>  Thus, both arms could be used to raise the flag and a larger, heavier flag could be employed.  Nevertheless, signalmen required great strength to use a 4-foot flag on a 16-foot pole.  Even a light wind would multiply the difficulty and rain made the flag heavier.  Contemporary flags were heavier than modern equivalents, being made of linen<ref>Myer (1866), p. 176</ref> or cotton.  Modern large flags designed to be hand held might be made of lighter silk or nylon and are more resistant to moisture retention.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 159</ref>\n\n=== Flags and disks ===\nThe flags came in seven combinations of colors and sizes.  They were all square flags with a smaller square (one third the width) of a different color in the center.  The colors available were a white flag with a red center, a black flag with a white center, and a red flag with a white center.  All three were produced in the most commonly used four foot ({{nowrap|120 cm}}) size.  The white and black flags came in a six foot ({{nowrap|180 cm}}) size for greater range, and the white and red flags had a two foot ({{nowrap|60 cm}}) size.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 176|Raines, p. 13}}</ref>  The size and color of flag was chosen depending on lighting conditions and distance.  The white flag was the most common and was used against dark backgrounds.  Against light or varied backgrounds, the red flag was more effective and was also used at sea.<ref>{{multiref|Greely, pp. 308\u2013309|Thompson, p. 12|Raines, p. 14}}</ref>  The black flag was used against a background of snow.<ref>Greely, pp. 308\u2013309</ref>  The two foot flags, called ''action flags'', were used in situations where the signalman needed to stay under cover from enemy fire or wished to signal less obtrusively.<ref>Raines, p. 14</ref>  Each flag had a number of ties or tapes sewn along the hoist edge.  These were used to fix the flag to a four-section staff, each section four feet long and fitted with ferrules for joining.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nThe disks were 12 to 18&nbsp;inches (30 to 46&nbsp;cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the heavy flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \"foot torch\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 176\u2013178</ref>  A 30X telescope was a standard part of the wigwag kit.  This was used by a signaler alongside the flagman to read the signals from the remote station, which could be at a distance of up to 20 miles.<ref>Thompson, p. 12</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe wigwag system filled a gap in the history of military communication between the age of close-quarter fighting and the age of modern long-range weapons.  In the 1860s, [[radio]] and [[telephone]] communications had yet to be invented and [[electrical telegraphy]], although established, was still in its infancy.  It was still being worked out how the latter could be used on the battlefield, and portable equipment ruggedized for military use was not available early in the decade.  Wigwag provided a method that was both simple to use and faster and more reliable than couriers.<ref>Raines, p. 31</ref>  By the start of [[World War I]], the range and accuracy of modern weapons had made flag signaling too dangerous to use on the front line, and more sophisticated technology was then available.<ref>Woods & Stirling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Albert J Myer in the field during American Civil War.png|thumb|Albert J. Myer (center) during the [[Peninsula campaign]] (1862)<ref>Raines, p. 24</ref> of the American Civil War]]\nThe wigwag system was invented by US Army surgeon Major [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s.  Myer took his inspiration from the [[telegraph code]] of [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], although the [[codepoint]]s finally used were not the same as Bain's.  The Bain code, invented 1843, was used on the chemical [[printing telegraph]] of that inventor and was a dot-dash code similar to the [[Morse code]].  Myer came across it while working as a [[telegraph operator]], work he did for a period after his graduation in 1847.  In 1851, Myer produced ''A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes'' as the thesis for his medical doctorate.  In this publication Myer used the Bain code as the basis for communication with a deaf person by tapping a hand or cheek.  Alternatively, tapping a table with which the person was also in contact could be used to pass messages.  In 1854, Myer joined the army as an assistant surgeon and was posted to Texas.  It was in Texas that he developed the idea of the wigwag flag or torch code for military use, building on his previous work with the deaf.<ref>{{multiref|Raines, p. 5|Chambers, p. 171}}</ref>  Myer also incorporated features of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] hand and smoke signals into his system.<ref>Wagner, p. 358</ref>\n\nIn 1856, while stationed at [[Fort Duncan]], Texas, Myer wrote to [[Jefferson Davis]], then [[Secretary of War]], proposing his signaling system.  He was supported by [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]] the Army [[Chief of Engineers]] but failed to get a hearing due to lack of detail in his proposal.  In 1857, Totten tried again with a new Secretary of War, [[John B. Floyd]].  In 1859, a board of examination under [[Robert E. Lee]] considered the proposal but thought it had only limited use.  They did not put it into operation but allowed Myer to continue with tests.  Myer conducted these tests starting in April, initially at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia, and later in New York and Washington.<ref>Raines, p. 6</ref>\n\nMyer, with Floyd's support, proposed that a new post of signal officer to the Army staff should be created, with him filling it.  In February 1860, Myer got a hearing before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs under the chairmanship of Jefferson Davis which supported the introduction of the system.  Davis opposed the creation of the signal officer post when it came before congress; he wanted to use the signaling system but feared the creation of the signal officer post would lead to the creation of a new department (the future [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]).  Davis's objections were ignored and Myer was made signal officer and promoted to major in June 1860.<ref>Raines, p. 6\u20137</ref>  Myer submitted a patent application in 1860 claiming the rights to all signaling systems based on motions (of which wigwag is an example) as opposed to positions (of which flag semaphore is an example).  The patent was granted in January 1861.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n=== In service ===\n[[File:Signal station Elk Mountain.jpg|thumb|upright|A wigwag station on [[Elk Ridge (Maryland)|Elk Ridge]], Maryland, during the [[Battle of Antietam]]]]\nThe first live use of the system was in 1860 in a campaign against the [[Navajo]] in the [[Department of New Mexico]].  Myer served under Major [[Edward Canby]] who became a strong supporter of the formation of a signal corps, which he thought more efficient than Myer's proposal to train every officer.  The Navajo war was over by February 1861, but at the same time the [[American Civil War]] was beginning.  Up to this point, Myer had been temporarily assigned men from the units in which he served to work as signalers, often grudgingly.  This was impractical for a large scale war and Myer now pressed for Canby's idea of a dedicated signal corps.  Many in Washington opposed the idea, and it took until 3 March 1863 before the Signal Corps was formally inaugurated, although the signalers had been informally called \"signal corps\" for some time.  Myer was put in charge with the rank of Colonel.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u201313</ref>\n\n==== Civil War ====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14782789933).jpg|thumb|upright|The Cobb's Hill wigwag tower, 1864]]\nWigwag was used extensively by [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|Civil War Signal Corps]] troops on both sides,<ref>Raines, pp. 23\u201329</ref> and was an essential supplement to the electrical telegraph.<ref>Wagner, p. 358</ref>  Its first use in battle was by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant [[Edward Porter Alexander]] (a former pupil of Myer)<ref>Greely, p. 313</ref> at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.<ref>Alexander, pp. 3, 4, 14\u201316, 30\u201331</ref>  The signalmen on this occasion fulfilled an important function by reporting a Union attempt to turn the Confederate flank.<ref>Rauch, p. 102</ref>  Myer had originally promoted the idea as a lightweight mobile system that could be carried by a single man.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref> \u2013 a common task for signalmen was to act as forward observers reporting artillery fall of shot.<ref>Raines, p. 9</ref>  As the war progressed, more substantial stations were constructed.  Enormous towers, some well over 100 feet, were built.<ref>Myer (1866), frontispiece</ref>  The Cobb's Hill tower shown in the image was built by the [[Appomattox River]] in June 1864.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>  Wherever possible, existing structures were used.  Building stations in trees was common, and church steeples were often used.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The system, at least on the Union side, took on the nature of a genuine communications network.<ref>Berkowitz, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  The Confederates, despite being first in the field with wigwag, and the Union side being slow to get going, never succeeded in building a network to the same extent.  The Confederate Signal Corps was simply not given resources on the same scale.<ref>Raines, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe mere existence of a flag station could cause problems for the enemy.  Alexander, in his memoirs, referred to the [[Little Round Top]] station as \"that wretched little signal station\" because he was forced to make roundabout movements of his troops and artillery to avoid being observed (at this time, 1863, Alexander was no longer connected with the Signal Corps, but was in command of the artillery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>Heidler & Heidler</ref>).  The Confederates had tried but failed to seize the position several times, including during [[Pickett's Charge]] in 1863.  During that action Captain Davis E. Castle continued to signal with a bedsheet after the flagman had retreated with the flags.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The 125 ft height of the Cobbs Hill tower gave it such a good view of Confederate movements that they assigned a gun battery specifically to destroy it.  They failed to achieve this and the tower remained in use until the [[fall of Petersburg]] to Union forces.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>\n\nSignalmen were sometimes assigned to ships to maintain communication between the navy and land forces.  On large operations they might also be used for ship-to-ship communication.  The signalman was posted high up on the masthead of the ship.  This was especially common on operations concerning the [[Mississippi River]] such as the [[Vicksburg campaign]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].<ref>Raines, p. 27</ref>\n[[File:UnionCipherDisk.nsa.jpg|thumb|upright|A Union cipher disk]]\nThe fact that the Confederates had personnel able to read the wigwag code was problematic for the Union side.  Security concerns led to a reluctance to send important messages by flag signals.  General [[Daniel Butterfield]] went so far as to order the [[Army of the Potomac]] not to use signals at all, much to the concern of its chief signal officer [[Benjamin F, Fisher]].  To overcome this problem, the Signal Corps created a [[cipher disk]] to encode messages.  It is believed that the Confederates never broke this code.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The Union side was able to read Confederate flag signals without being discovered until at least 1864 when Myer's successor as head of the Signal Corps, [[William J. L. Nicodemus]], published the fact in a pamphlet.  Nicodemus was dismissed in December 1864 for this breach of security and replaced by Fisher.<ref>Raines, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nMyer did not use the term ''wigwag'' in the manuals he produced.  He called the system ''aerial signals''<ref>Myer (1872), p. </ref> or ''aerial telegraphy''.<ref>Thompson, p. 13</ref>  The system probably came to be known as wigwag because of the apparently random motions of the flag as seen by an untrained observer.<ref name=museum>US Army Signal Museum, \"Crossed flags: History of the wigwag\", United States Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707002941/http://www.gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/csrdflag.asp archived] 7 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==== Signal station gallery ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Wigwag 130 ft tower.png|A 130 foot wigwag tower used in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag 125 ft tower.png|125 ft wigwag tower used in operations against Richmond<ref>Myer (1866), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag masthead signal station, Richmond.png|Wigwag station on the masthead of a US ship at Richmond<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag station near Washington.png|Wigwag station near Washington<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag tree station, upper Potomac.png|Wigwag station in a tree on the [[Upper Potomac River]]<ref>Myer (1872), fronispiece</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other campaigns ====\nThe Civil War was the high point of the use of wigwag, but there were some other campaigns that included flag signalmen, mainly against Native Americans.  Signal parties accompanied general [[Patrick E. Connor]] on the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865 in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]].  The signalmen were used to maintain communications between troop columns.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The campaign was a punitive expedition against the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]<ref>McDermott, p.6</ref> in retaliation for raiding and disrupting travel on the [[Bozeman Trail]].  The expedition was a large operation consisting of three separate columns approaching from different directions.<ref>Coutant, ch. 36</ref>\n\nWigwag was taken up by some European countries, notably the British in African colonial wars.  It was used extensively in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.  Once [[Morse code]] became an international standard, the British dropped the Myer code for wigwag signaling and used Morse instead with the flag movements indicating dots and dashes.  The French had a slight variation of that, using a single flag for ''dot'' and two flags for ''dash''.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n[[File:Sign (8037141146).jpg|thumb|upright|US Army Signal Corp insignia featuring crossed wigwag flags and torch]]\n{{see also|Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Telegraph train and the Beardslee telegraph}}\n\nEven while the Civil War was still in progress, the electrical telegraph was starting to displace flag signaling.  This perhaps did not happen as quickly as it might have done because the US Military Telegraph and the Signal Corps were under different leaderships.  Myer made repeated attempts to absorb the Military Telegraph but failed due to political rivalries, particulary Myer's rivalry with the civilian head of the Military Telegraph, [[Anson Stager]].  This prevented a clear distinction being formed between strategic and tactical communications.  Sensibly, the Signal Corps as the tactical wing should have had full access to electrical telegraph technology, but Stager attempted to prevent this.<ref>Hagerman, pp. 41\u201342</ref>  Nevertheless, Myer was able to institute ''telegraph trains'' (that is, trains of wagons, not rail locomotives) that carried a combination of electrical telegraph and flag equipment.  The original idea was to use the [[Morse telegraph]] in the trains, but due to the unavailability of trained Morse operators to Myer, the contractor, [[Henry J. Rogers]], replaced the Morse key and sounder with a circular alphabet and pointer of his own design that could be operated by any literate person.  A further change was the replacement of acid batteries for power with a hand-cranked [[electrical generator]] invented by [[George W. Beardslee]].<ref>Raines, pp. 16\u201318</ref>  Although these changes made use in the field easier, they had serious disadvantages.  The Rogers alphabet system slowed down the speed of transmission, and the Beardslee generator was only powerful enough for short distances.  These problems resulted in occasions when the Signal Corps had to turn over its lines to the Military Telegraph with their superior equipment.  After the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863 where these problems were apparent, Myer tried to recruit Morse operators through advertisements.  However, this just resulted in Myer's dismissal for exceeding his authority, and replacement by Nicodemus.  The inability of the Signal Corps to fully adopt the electrical telegraph ensured that flag signals remained in widespread use throughout the war.<ref>Raines, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nMyer's code remained in use in the US until 1886 when it was replaced by [[Telegraph code#Comparison of flag codes|Morse code for flag signals]].<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 15</ref>  It came back into use after 1896,<ref name=museum/> but was officially discontinued in 1912 when [[International Morse code]] was mandated for all types of visual signaling. Inconsistently, [[American Morse code]] was mandated for Army electrical telegraph lines, but not for [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Coe, p. 3</ref>  The wigwag method was superseded by [[flag semaphore]] for short distances, and the [[heliograph]] for long distances in regions where the electrical telegraph was not available.  The heliograph saw widespread use in Arizona and New Mexico after [[Nelson A. Miles]] took over command of the campaign against the [[Apache]] in 1886.<ref>Miles, pp. 481\u2013484</ref>  In good conditions, the heliograph could transmit over distances as great as 50 miles.  This is far in excess of anything achievable with flag signaling.<ref>Woods, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n== Code details ==\n=== Two-symbol code (General Service Code) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flag motions<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 55\u201356, plates E, F</ref>\n|-\n!Symbol!!Motion\n|-\n|1||Wave flag to ground on right\n|-\n|2||Wave flag to ground on left\n|-\n|3||Dip flag to ground in front\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Letters\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common words and syllables<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|1111||&\n|-\n|2212||ing\n|-\n|1112||tion\n|-\n|a||after\n|-\n|b||before\n|-\n|c||can\n|-\n|h||have\n|-\n|n||not\n|-\n|r||are\n|-\n|t||the\n|-\n|u||you\n|-\n|ur||your\n|-\n|w||word\n|-\n|wi||with\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Controls<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|3||End of word\n|-\n|33||End of sentence\n|-\n|333||End of message\n|-\n|22.22.22.3||Understood\n|-\n|22.22.22.333||Stop sending\n|-\n|121.121.121||Repeat\n|-\n|212121||Error\n|-\n|211.211.211||Move to the right\n|-\n|221.221.221||Move to the left\n|-\n|Continuos waving||Attention\n|-\n|Two circles to right||End of address\n|-\n|Two circles to left||Start of signature\n|}\n\nNumerals could represent a control signal as well as a number.

Similarly, \"4\" starting on the left can only follow \"1\" or \"3\".<ref>Myer (1872), p. 109</ref>  For example, \"C\" in the General Service Code is coded as \"121\", which is \"left-right-left\".  In this code it is coded as \"234\" which is a motion from the ready position to the left (\"2\"), followed by a motion from the left to the right (\"3\"), followed by a motion from the right to the left (\"4\").  Together these make the motions \"left-right-left\", the same as the General Service Code.

It differs from [[flag semaphore]] in that it uses one flag rather than two, and the symbols for each letter are represented by the motion of the flag rather than its position.  The larger flag and its motion allow messages to be read over greater distances than semaphore.  Messages could be sent at night using torches instead of flags.\n\nThe most common code used with wigwag had three motions, only two of which were needed to form letters of the alphabet.  These two were waving the flag, respectively, to the left and right \u2013 the wigwagging motion.  A [[Character (computing)|character]] was formed by sequentially displaying a number of motions (elements).  Like [[Morse code]], the number of elements in each character was not fixed, the most common letters being assigned the shortest codes.  A number of other codes were used at times, some of them with a fixed number of elements and up to four different motions.  Morse code was used with wigwag after it became an international standard.\n\nThe wigwag system was invented in the 1850s by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] who became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively by both sides in the [[American Civil War]] and continued to see use in both America and Europe until the end of the century.  After that, long distance communication was performed by [[electrical telegraphy]], or in some places where the telegraph was not available, by [[heliograph]].\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Wigwag motions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The basic wigwag signaling motions<ref>Myer (1866), plate F</ref>]]\nThe wigwag system consisted of a signalman waving a single large flag or other display device in different motions sequentially.  At night, a lamp on a pole could be used, or over short distances the signalman might hold a small disk.  The usual wigwag code was ternary, that is, there were three different motions (symbols) that could be displayed. However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary.  The third symbol only appeared in [[control character]]s.  The neutral position was the signalman holding the flag vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.<ref>Myer (1866), p. 83</ref>\n\nLike [[Morse code]], the normal wigwag code did not have a fixed length (number of elements) for each [[Character (computing)|character]].  For instance, ''i'' was coded as \"1\", but ''d'' was coded as \"222\".<ref>Wolters, p. 10</ref>  The table shows the commonly used wigwag code and the diagram shows the flag motions.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 68</ref>  It is as defined in the [[General Service Code]] of July 1864 issued to standardize signals of the US Army and Navy.<ref>Raines, p. 13</ref>  Further details of the code and an alternate four-symbol representation are given in {{sectionlink|#Code details}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Wigwag code (General Service Code)\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\nThe notation of the wigwag code was originally defined as \"1\" representing the motion to the left and \"2\" representing the motion to the right.  That is, all occurences of \"1\" and \"2\" are interchanged in the table.  This was changed when the General Service Code was issued.  The thinking was that the motion to the left should be notated with the lowest digit, but as seen through a telescope (the usual method of observing) the image is inverted with left and right interchanged.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 95</ref>  The code tabulated in some modern sources shows this earlier notation with \"1\" and \"2\" interchanged.<ref>eg, Raines, p. 7</ref>\n\nTo open communication, the signalman waves the flag continuously from side to side (the \"attention\" signal) until the receiving station replies with the \"understood\" signal (22.22.22.3).  The transmitting station replies with the \"understood\" signal and proceeds to send the message.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 72</ref>  The elements of a character are performed rapidly without pause between them, only returning the flag to the rest position at the end of the character.<ref>{{multiref|Coe, p. 3|Myer (1866), pp. 53, 80}}</ref>  The US Army ''Manual of Signals'' lists several alternative codes, including a three-element fixed-length code using four symbols (1866 edition), and a three-element fixed-length code using three symbols (1872 edition). There is no indication in the manual that these codes were actually in use.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 97|Myer (1872), p. 96}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wigwag flag colours.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Available colors for wigwag flags]]\nWigwag has an advantage over [[flag semaphore]] in that only one flag is used instead of two.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref>  Thus, both arms could be used to raise the flag and a larger, heavier flag could be employed.  Nevertheless, signalmen required great strength to use a 4-foot flag on a 16-foot pole.  Even a light wind would multiply the difficulty and rain made the flag heavier.  Contemporary flags were heavier than modern equivalents, being made of linen<ref>Myer (1866), p. 176</ref> or cotton.  Modern large flags designed to be hand held might be made of lighter silk or nylon and are more resistant to moisture retention.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 159</ref>\n\n=== Flags and disks ===\nThe flags came in seven combinations of colors and sizes.  They were all square flags with a smaller square (one third the width) of a different color in the center.  The colors available were a white flag with a red center, a black flag with a white center, and a red flag with a white center.  All three were produced in the most commonly used four foot ({{nowrap|120 cm}}) size.  The white and black flags came in a six foot ({{nowrap|180 cm}}) size for greater range, and the white and red flags had a two foot ({{nowrap|60 cm}}) size.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 176|Raines, p. 13}}</ref>  The size and color of flag was chosen depending on lighting conditions and distance.  The white flag was the most common and was used against dark backgrounds.  Against light or varied backgrounds, the red flag was more effective and was also used at sea.<ref>{{multiref|Greely, pp. 308\u2013309|Thompson, p. 12|Raines, p. 14}}</ref>  The black flag was used against a background of snow.<ref>Greely, pp. 308\u2013309</ref>  The two foot flags, called ''action flags'', were used in situations where the signalman needed to stay under cover from enemy fire or wished to signal less obtrusively.<ref>Raines, p. 14</ref>  Each flag had a number of ties or tapes sewn along the hoist edge.  These were used to fix the flag to a four-section staff, each section four feet long and fitted with ferrules for joining.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nThe disks were 12 to 18&nbsp;inches (30 to 46&nbsp;cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the heavy flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \"foot torch\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 176\u2013178</ref>  A 30X telescope was a standard part of the wigwag kit.  This was used by a signaler alongside the flagman to read the signals from the remote station, which could be at a distance of up to 20 miles.<ref>Thompson, p. 12</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe wigwag system filled a gap in the history of military communication between the age of close-quarter fighting and the age of modern long-range weapons.  In the 1860s, [[radio]] and [[telephone]] communications had yet to be invented and [[electrical telegraphy]], although established, was still in its infancy.  It was still being worked out how the latter could be used on the battlefield, and portable equipment ruggedized for military use was not available early in the decade.  Wigwag provided a method that was both simple to use and faster and more reliable than couriers.<ref>Raines, p. 31</ref>  By the start of [[World War I]], the range and accuracy of modern weapons had made flag signaling too dangerous to use on the front line, and more sophisticated technology was then available.<ref>Woods & Stirling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Albert J Myer in the field during American Civil War.png|thumb|Albert J. Myer (center) during the [[Peninsula campaign]] (1862)<ref>Raines, p. 24</ref> of the American Civil War]]\nThe wigwag system was invented by US Army surgeon Major [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s.  Myer took his inspiration from the [[telegraph code]] of [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], although the [[codepoint]]s finally used were not the same as Bain's.  The Bain code, invented 1843, was used on the chemical [[printing telegraph]] of that inventor and was a dot-dash code similar to the [[Morse code]].  Myer came across it while working as a [[telegraph operator]], work he did for a period after his graduation in 1847.  In 1851, Myer produced ''A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes'' as the thesis for his medical doctorate.  In this publication Myer used the Bain code as the basis for communication with a deaf person by tapping a hand or cheek.  Alternatively, tapping a table with which the person was also in contact could be used to pass messages.  In 1854, Myer joined the army as an assistant surgeon and was posted to Texas.  It was in Texas that he developed the idea of the wigwag flag or torch code for military use, building on his previous work with the deaf.<ref>{{multiref|Raines, p. 5|Chambers, p. 171}}</ref>  Myer also incorporated features of [[Native American]] hand and smoke signals into his system.<ref>Wagner, p. 358</ref>\n\nIn 1856, while stationed at [[Fort Duncan]], Texas, Myer wrote to [[Jefferson Davis]], then [[Secretary of War]], proposing his signaling system.  He was supported by [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]] the Army [[Chief of Engineers]] but failed to get a hearing due to lack of detail in his proposal.  In 1857, Totten tried again with a new Secretary of War, [[John B. Floyd]].  In 1859, a board of examination under [[Robert E. Lee]] considered the proposal but thought it had only limited use.  They did not put it into operation but allowed Myer to continue with tests.  Myer conducted these tests starting in April, initially at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia, and later in New York and Washington.<ref>Raines, p. 6</ref>\n\nMyer, with Floyd's support, proposed that a new post of signal officer to the Army staff should be created, with him filling it.  In February 1860, Myer got a hearing before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs under the chairmanship of Jefferson Davis which supported the introduction of the system.  Davis opposed the creation of the signal officer post when it came before congress; he wanted to use the signaling system but feared the creation of the signal officer post would lead to the creation of a new department (the future [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]).  Davis's objections were ignored and Myer was made signal officer and promoted to major in June 1860.<ref>Raines, p. 6\u20137</ref>  Myer submitted a patent application in 1860 claiming the rights to all signaling systems based on motions (of which wigwag is an example) as opposed to positions (of which flag semaphore is an example).  The patent was granted in January 1861.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n=== In service ===\n[[File:Signal station Elk Mountain.jpg|thumb|upright|A wigwag station on [[Elk Ridge (Maryland)|Elk Ridge]], Maryland, during the [[Battle of Antietam]]]]\nThe first live use of the system was in 1860 in a campaign against the [[Navajo]] in the [[Department of New Mexico]].  Myer served under Major [[Edward Canby]] who became a strong supporter of the formation of a signal corps, which he thought more efficient than Myer's proposal to train every officer.  The Navajo war was over by February 1861, but at the same time the [[American Civil War]] was beginning.  Up to this point, Myer had been temporarily assigned men from the units in which he served to work as signalers, often grudgingly.  This was impractical for a large scale war and Myer now pressed for Canby's idea of a dedicated signal corps.  Many in Washington opposed the idea, and it took until 3 March 1863 before the Signal Corps was formally inaugurated, although the signalers had been informally called \"signal corps\" for some time.  Myer was put in charge with the rank of Colonel.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u201313</ref>\n\n==== Civil War ====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14782789933).jpg|thumb|upright|The Cobb's Hill wigwag tower, 1864]]\nWigwag was used extensively by [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|Civil War Signal Corps]] troops on both sides,<ref>Raines, pp. 23\u201329</ref> and was an essential supplement to the electrical telegraph.<ref>Wagner, p. 358</ref>  Its first use in battle was by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant [[Edward Porter Alexander]] (a former pupil of Myer)<ref>Greely, p. 313</ref> at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.<ref>Alexander, pp. 3, 4, 14\u201316, 30\u201331</ref>  The signalmen on this occasion fulfilled an important function by reporting a Union attempt to turn the Confederate flank.<ref>Rauch, p. 102</ref>  Myer had originally promoted the idea as a lightweight mobile system that could be carried by a single man.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref> \u2013 a common task for signalmen was to act as forward observers reporting artillery fall of shot.<ref>Raines, p. 9</ref>  As the war progressed, more substantial stations were constructed.  Enormous towers, some well over 100 feet, were built.<ref>Myer (1866), frontispiece</ref>  The Cobb's Hill tower shown in the image was built by the [[Appomattox River]] in June 1864.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>  Wherever possible, existing structures were used.  Building stations in trees was common, and church steeples were often used.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The system, at least on the Union side, took on the nature of a genuine communications network.<ref>Berkowitz, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  The Confederates, despite being first in the field with wigwag, and the Union side being slow to get going, never succeeded in building a network to the same extent.  The Confederate Signal Corps was simply not given resources on the same scale.<ref>Raines, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe mere existence of a flag station could cause problems for the enemy.  Alexander, in his memoirs, referred to the [[Little Round Top]] station as \"that wretched little signal station\" because he was forced to make roundabout movements of his troops and artillery to avoid being observed (at this time, 1863, Alexander was no longer connected with the Signal Corps, but was in command of the artillery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>Heidler & Heidler</ref>).  The Confederates had tried but failed to seize the position several times, including during [[Pickett's Charge]] in 1863.  During that action Captain Davis E. Castle continued to signal with a bedsheet after the flagman had retreated with the flags.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The 125 ft height of the Cobbs Hill tower gave it such a good view of Confederate movements that they assigned a gun battery specifically to destroy it.  They failed to achieve this and the tower remained in use until the [[fall of Petersburg]] to Union forces.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>\n\nSignalmen were sometimes assigned to ships to maintain communication between the navy and land forces.  On large operations they might also be used for ship-to-ship communication.  The signalman was posted high up on the masthead of the ship.  This was especially common on operations concerning the [[Mississippi River]] such as the [[Vicksburg campaign]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].<ref>Raines, p. 27</ref>\n[[File:UnionCipherDisk.nsa.jpg|thumb|upright|A Union cipher disk]]\nThe fact that the Confederates had personnel able to read the wigwag code was problematic for the Union side.  Security concerns led to a reluctance to send important messages by flag signals.  General [[Daniel Butterfield]] went so far as to order the [[Army of the Potomac]] not to use signals at all, much to the concern of its chief signal officer [[Benjamin F, Fisher]].  To overcome this problem, the Signal Corps created a [[cipher disk]] to encode messages.  It is believed that the Confederates never broke this code.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The Union side was able to read Confederate flag signals without being discovered until at least 1864 when Myer's successor as head of the Signal Corps, [[William J. L. Nicodemus]], published the fact in a pamphlet.  Nicodemus was dismissed in December 1864 for this breach of security and replaced by Fisher.<ref>Raines, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nMyer did not use the term ''wigwag'' in the manuals he produced.  He called the system ''aerial signals''<ref>Myer (1872), p. </ref> or ''aerial telegraphy''.<ref>Thompson, p. 13</ref>  The system probably came to be known as wigwag because of the apparently random motions of the flag as seen by an untrained observer.<ref name=museum>US Army Signal Museum, \"Crossed flags: History of the wigwag\", United States Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707002941/http://www.gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/csrdflag.asp archived] 7 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==== Signal station gallery ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Wigwag 130 ft tower.png|A 130 foot wigwag tower used in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag 125 ft tower.png|125 ft wigwag tower used in operations against Richmond<ref>Myer (1866), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag masthead signal station, Richmond.png|Wigwag station on the masthead of a US ship at Richmond<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag station near Washington.png|Wigwag station near Washington<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag tree station, upper Potomac.png|Wigwag station in a tree on the [[Upper Potomac River]]<ref>Myer (1872), fronispiece</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other campaigns ====\nThe Civil War was the high point of the use of wigwag, but there were some other campaigns that included flag signalmen, mainly against Native Americans.  Signal parties accompanied general [[Patrick E. Connor]] on the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865 in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]].  The signalmen were used to maintain communications between troop columns.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The campaign was a punitive expedition against the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]<ref>McDermott, p.6</ref> in retaliation for raiding and disrupting travel on the [[Bozeman Trail]].  The expedition was a large operation consisting of three separate columns approaching from different directions.<ref>Coutant, ch. 36</ref>\n\nWigwag was taken up by some European countries, notably the British in African colonial wars.  It was used extensively in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.  Once [[Morse code]] became an international standard, the British dropped the Myer code for wigwag signaling and used Morse instead with the flag movements indicating dots and dashes.  The French had a slight variation of that, using a single flag for ''dot'' and two flags for ''dash''.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n[[File:Sign (8037141146).jpg|thumb|upright|US Army Signal Corp insignia featuring crossed wigwag flags and torch]]\n{{see also|Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Telegraph train and the Beardslee telegraph}}\n\nEven while the Civil War was still in progress, the electrical telegraph was starting to displace flag signaling.  This perhaps did not happen as quickly as it might have done because the US Military Telegraph and the Signal Corps were under different leaderships.  Myer made repeated attempts to absorb the Military Telegraph but failed due to political rivalries, particulary Myer's rivalry with the civilian head of the Military Telegraph, [[Anson Stager]].  This prevented a clear distinction being formed between strategic and tactical communications.  Sensibly, the Signal Corps as the tactical wing should have had full access to electrical telegraph technology, but Stager attempted to prevent this.<ref>Hagerman, pp. 41\u201342</ref>  Nevertheless, Myer was able to institute ''telegraph trains'' (that is, trains of wagons, not rail locomotives) that carried a combination of electrical telegraph and flag equipment.  The original idea was to use the [[Morse telegraph]] in the trains, but due to the unavailability of trained Morse operators to Myer, the contractor, [[Henry J. Rogers]], replaced the Morse key and sounder with a circular alphabet and pointer of his own design that could be operated by any literate person.  A further change was the replacement of acid batteries for power with a hand-cranked [[electrical generator]] invented by [[George W. Beardslee]].<ref>Raines, pp. 16\u201318</ref>  Although these changes made use in the field easier, they had serious disadvantages.  The Rogers alphabet system slowed down the speed of transmission, and the Beardslee generator was only powerful enough for short distances.  These problems resulted in occasions when the Signal Corps had to turn over its lines to the Military Telegraph with their superior equipment.  After the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863 where these problems were apparent, Myer tried to recruit Morse operators through advertisements.  However, this just resulted in Myer's dismissal for exceeding his authority, and replacement by Nicodemus.  The inability of the Signal Corps to fully adopt the electrical telegraph ensured that flag signals remained in widespread use throughout the war.<ref>Raines, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nMyer's code remained in use in the US until 1886 when it was replaced by [[Telegraph code#Comparison of flag codes|Morse code for flag signals]].<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 15</ref>  It came back into use after 1896,<ref name=museum/> but was officially discontinued in 1912 when [[International Morse code]] was mandated for all types of visual signaling. Inconsistently, [[American Morse code]] was mandated for Army electrical telegraph lines, but not for [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Coe, p. 3</ref>  The wigwag method was superseded by [[flag semaphore]] for short distances, and the [[heliograph]] for long distances in regions where the electrical telegraph was not available.  The heliograph saw widespread use in Arizona and New Mexico after [[Nelson A. Miles]] took over command of the campaign against the [[Apache]] in 1886.<ref>Miles, pp. 481\u2013484</ref>  In good conditions, the heliograph could transmit over distances as great as 50 miles.  This is far in excess of anything achievable with flag signaling.<ref>Woods, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n== Code details ==\n=== Two-symbol code (General Service Code) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flag motions<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 55\u201356, plates E, F</ref>\n|-\n!Symbol!!Motion\n|-\n|1||Wave flag to ground on right\n|-\n|2||Wave flag to ground on left\n|-\n|3||Dip flag to ground in front\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Letters\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common words and syllables<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|1111||&\n|-\n|2212||ing\n|-\n|1112||tion\n|-\n|a||after\n|-\n|b||before\n|-\n|c||can\n|-\n|h||have\n|-\n|n||not\n|-\n|r||are\n|-\n|t||the\n|-\n|u||you\n|-\n|ur||your\n|-\n|w||word\n|-\n|wi||with\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Controls<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|3||End of word\n|-\n|33||End of sentence\n|-\n|333||End of message\n|-\n|22.22.22.3||Understood\n|-\n|22.22.22.333||Stop sending\n|-\n|121.121.121||Repeat\n|-\n|212121||Error\n|-\n|211.211.211||Move to the right\n|-\n|221.221.221||Move to the left\n|-\n|Continuos waving||Attention\n|-\n|Two circles to right||End of address\n|-\n|Two circles to left||Start of signature\n|}\n\nNumerals could represent a control signal as well as a number.

That is, there is no difference in the signals as observed, only in the notation as written.<ref>Myer (1872), pp. 109\u2013110</ref>  The difference is that this representation makes it explicit that there should be no pause at the ready position within a character.

Similarly, \"4\" starting on the left can only follow \"1\" or \"3\".<ref>Myer (1872), p. 109</ref>  For example, \"C\" in the General Service Code is coded as \"121\", which is \"left-right-left\".  In this code it is coded as \"234\" which is a motion from the ready position to the left (\"2\"), followed by a motion from the left to the right (\"3\"), followed by a motion from the right to the left (\"4\").  Together these make the motions \"left-right-left\", the same as the General Service Code.

The Desjardins Group, through subsidiary D\u00e9veloppement international Desjardins, is also active in over 30 developing countries through technical assistance programs and various investments.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\nAt the turn of the 20th century, people in rural areas of Qu\u00e9bec largely found themselves unable to obtain credit from banks in order to keep operating their farms and businesses, and often had to resort to loan sharks instead. After studying European credit institutions established in the 19th century, [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] came up with an original solution adapted to North America.<ref name=\"martin\" /> In December 1900, in his house in [[L\u00e9vis,_Quebec|L\u00e9vis]], he and other members of the community created a credit union (''caisse populaire'', literally ''people's cash box'') for savings and loans. The ''caisse'' would be under the control of its own customers (members), as a cooperative, and redistribute any profits among its members. The initial goals were:\n* To encourage savings;\n* To build, from these savings, a credit system that would be accessible to labourers, farmers and any honest person;\n* To strengthen family and artisanal enterprises;\n* To eliminate abusive loan practices;\n* To introduce leading members of the community to business and economic principles;\n* To improve the material conditions of workers and contribute to the progress of French Canada.\n\nIn the next few years, many ''caisses populaires'' opened all over Qu\u00e9bec, mostly in rural areas, often as an initiative of a Catholic parish. Alphonse Desjardins initially tried to get these institutions established under a federal banking charter, but this was denied repeatedly. A Qu\u00e9bec provincial charter was finally issued in 1906. By the time Alphonse Desjardins died in 1920, there were 187 ''caisses'' in Qu\u00e9bec, 24 in Ontario and 9 in the United States.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, the informal network of ''caisses'' became more structured and expanded into other sectors such as insurance (1940s) and investment banking (1970s). Many new ''caisses'' were created in urban neighbourhoods.\n\nBy 1990, there over 1000 ''caisses'' in Qu\u00e9bec with approximately 5 million members. The ''caisses'', typically centered on a neighbourhood or village, were grouped into regional federations which were themselves grouped into a confederation. Each ''caisse'' was a independent entity with its own banking transit number, but the confederation provided many centralised services such as the ATM network.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a consolidation and merger phase reduced the number of ''caisses'' from 1275 to 800.<ref>{{cite web |last1=B\u00e9rub\u00e9 |first1=G\u00e9rard |title=L\u2019\u00e2me de Desjardins\n|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/440009/perspectives-l-ame-de-desjardins |publisher=[[Le Devoir]] |language=fr |date=2015}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, total assets at Desjardins Group grew over 15% from [[Canadian dollar|C$]]151.9&nbsp;billion (when it ranked sixth in Canada and first in Quebec among [[financial institution]]s ahead of the [[National Bank of Canada]]) to over $175&nbsp;billion in 2010.

The Desjardins Group, through subsidiary D\u00e9veloppement international Desjardins, is also active in over 30 developing countries through technical assistance programs and various investments.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\nAt the turn of the 20th century, people in rural areas of Qu\u00e9bec largely found themselves unable to obtain credit from banks in order to keep operating their farms and businesses, and often had to resort to loan sharks instead. After studying European credit institutions established in the 19th century, [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] came up with an original solution adapted to North America.<ref name=\"martin\" /> In December 1900, in his house in [[L\u00e9vis,_Quebec|L\u00e9vis]], he and other members of the community created a credit union (''caisse populaire'', literally ''people's cash box'') for savings and loans. The ''caisse'' would be under the control of its own customers (members), as a cooperative, and redistribute any profits among its members. The initial goals were:\n- To encourage savings;\n- To build, from these savings, a credit system that would be accessible to labourers, farmers and any honest person;\n- To strengthen family and artisanal enterprises;\n- To eliminate abusive loan practices;\n- To introduce leading members of the community to business and economic principles;\n- To improve the material conditions of workers and contribute to the progress of French Canada.\n\nIn the next few years, many ''caisses populaires'' opened all over Qu\u00e9bec, mostly in rural areas, often as an initiative of a Catholic parish. Alphonse Desjardins initially tried to get these institutions established under a federal banking charter, but this was denied repeatedly. A Qu\u00e9bec provincial charter was finally issued in 1906. By the time Alphonse Desjardins died in 1920, there were 187 ''caisses'' in Qu\u00e9bec, 24 in Ontario and 9 in the United States.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, the informal network of ''caisses'' became more structured and expanded into other sectors such as insurance (1940s) and investment banking (1970s). Many new ''caisses'' were created in urban neighbourhoods.\n\nBy 1990, there over 1000 ''caisses'' in Qu\u00e9bec with approximately 5 million members. The ''caisses'', typically centered on a neighbourhood or village, were grouped into regional federations which were themselves grouped into a confederation. Each ''caisse'' was a independent entity with its own banking transit number, but the confederation provided many centralised services such as the ATM network.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a consolidation and merger phase reduced the number of ''caisses'' from 1275 to 800.<ref>{{cite web |last1=B\u00e9rub\u00e9 |first1=G\u00e9rard |title=L\u2019\u00e2me de Desjardins\n|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/440009/perspectives-l-ame-de-desjardins |publisher=[[Le Devoir]] |language=fr |date=2015}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, total assets at Desjardins Group grew over 15% from [[Canadian dollar|C$]]151.9&nbsp;billion (when it ranked sixth in Canada and first in Quebec among [[financial institution]]s ahead of the [[National Bank of Canada]]) to over $175&nbsp;billion in 2010.
