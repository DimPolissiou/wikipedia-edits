In 1880, he deciphered another hieroglyphic which he recognised as the governing prefix that identified divinity. He had suspected for some time that [[Bo\u011fazkale|Boghazkoy]] was the capital of the [[Hittites]] because some hieroglyphic scripts found at [[Aleppo]] and Hamath in northern Syria were matched to the script on a monument at Boghazkoy.\n\nIn 1882, in a lecture to the [[Society of Biblical Archaeology]] in London, he announced that the Hittites, far from being a small [[Canaan]]ite tribe who dealt with the kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], were the people of a \"lost Hittite empire\", which [[New Kingdom|Egyptian]] texts were then bringing to light. He and [[William Wright (missionary)|William Wright]] identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with [[Hattusa]], the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the [[Aegean Sea]] to the banks of the [[Euphrates]], centuries before the age of the [[Old Testament]] patriarchs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Bryce|authorlink=Trevor R. Bryce|title=Life and Society in the Hittite World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|page=3}}</ref>\n\nSayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a [[syllabary]], that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.\n\nSayce dreamed of finding a bilingual [[Rosetta Stone]]. In 1880, he found a clue on a writing that spoke of an ancient silver disk discovered in [[Istanbul]]. It was a small-sized relic resembling a seal. In its centre, the figure of a warrior wearing a short robe, cape, helmet and upward-toe-capped boots (a Hittite apparel, no doubt) lay. The frieze around the warrior contained a cuneiform inscription in [[Hurrian]] dialect. Sayce supposed that the cuneiform inscription on the seal and the Hittite characters contained in its inner circle expressed one only meaning. Therefore, he was facing a bilingual text.\n\nWorking with a plaster impression, Sayce translated the cuneiform text of a seal \"Tarritktimme, king of the country of Erme\" (Walters Gallery, Baltimore). By late 1886, only seven signs had been deciphered out of the totality of signs belonging to the hieroglyphic system.\n\nLater, after Sayce had turned his attention to [[Egyptology]], archives were discovered at Hattusa that unlocked the language spoken there.\n\nLectures were his favourite vehicle for publication. He published in 1887 his [[Hibbert lectures]] on Babylonian religion;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sayce, Rev. Archibald Henry|journal=Who's Who|year=1913|page=1782|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453201;view=1up;seq=1816}}</ref> in 1902 his [[Gifford lectures]] on Egyptian and Babylonian religion; and in 1907 his [[Rhind lectures]].\n\nSayce was working at [[Eileithyiaspolis|El Kab]] in Egypt with [[Somers Clarke]] in the 1900s. In his seasonal winter digs in Egypt he always hired a well-furnished boat on the [[Nile]] to accommodate his travelling library, which also enabled him to offer tea to visiting Egyptologists like the young American [[James Henry Breasted]] and his wife.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n===Books===\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = Fresh light from the ancient monuments : a sketch of the most striking confirmations of the Bible, from recent discoveries in Egypt, Palestine, Assyria, Babylonia, Asia Minor\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = [[Religious Tract Society]]\n | series = [[By-paths of Bible Knowledge]]\n | volume = III\n | orig-year =\n | year = 1865\n | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroman00sayc\n |accessdate=2020-04-17}} ({{Citation | title = 2nd Edition | year = 1884 | publisher = Religious Tract Society | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroma01saycgoog|accessdate=2020-04-17}})({{Citation | title = 7th Edition | year = 1892 | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroman92sayc|accessdate=2020-04-17}})\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = The origin of Semitic civilisation, chiefly upon philological evidence\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Harrison & Sons\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1872\n | url = https://archive.org/details/originsemiticci00saycgoog\n |accessdate=2020-04-17\n }}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = An Assyrian grammar for comparative purposes\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Tr\u00fcbner & Co\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1872\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_WWAUAAAAYAAJ\n |accessdate=2020-04-17\n }}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = The principles of comparative philology\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Tr\u00fcbner & Co\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1874\n | url = https://archive.org/details/principlescompa06saycgoog\n |accessdate=2020-04-17}} ({{Citation |title = 4th Edition  | year = 1893 | publisher = Scribner | url = https://archive.org/details/cu31924026441729 |accessdate=2020-04-17}})\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = Archaic classics.

In 1880, he deciphered another hieroglyphic which he recognised as the governing prefix that identified divinity. He had suspected for some time that [[Bo\u011fazkale|Boghazkoy]] was the capital of the [[Hittites]] because some hieroglyphic scripts found at [[Aleppo]] and Hamath in northern Syria were matched to the script on a monument at Boghazkoy.\n\nIn 1882, in a lecture to the [[Society of Biblical Archaeology]] in London, he announced that the Hittites, far from being a small [[Canaan]]ite tribe who dealt with the kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], were the people of a \"lost Hittite empire\", which [[New Kingdom|Egyptian]] texts were then bringing to light. He and [[William Wright (missionary)|William Wright]] identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with [[Hattusa]], the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the [[Aegean Sea]] to the banks of the [[Euphrates]], centuries before the age of the [[Old Testament]] patriarchs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Bryce|authorlink=Trevor R. Bryce|title=Life and Society in the Hittite World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|page=3}}</ref>\n\nSayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a [[syllabary]], that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.\n\nSayce dreamed of finding a bilingual [[Rosetta Stone]]. In 1880, he found a clue on a writing that spoke of an ancient silver disk discovered in [[Istanbul]]. It was a small-sized relic resembling a seal. In its centre, the figure of a warrior wearing a short robe, cape, helmet and upward-toe-capped boots (a Hittite apparel, no doubt) lay. The frieze around the warrior contained a cuneiform inscription in [[Hurrian]] dialect. Sayce supposed that the cuneiform inscription on the seal and the Hittite characters contained in its inner circle expressed one only meaning. Therefore, he was facing a bilingual text.\n\nWorking with a plaster impression, Sayce translated the cuneiform text of a seal \"Tarritktimme, king of the country of Erme\" (Walters Gallery, Baltimore). By late 1886, only seven signs had been deciphered out of the totality of signs belonging to the hieroglyphic system.\n\nLater, after Sayce had turned his attention to [[Egyptology]], archives were discovered at Hattusa that unlocked the language spoken there.\n\nLectures were his favourite vehicle for publication. He published in 1887 his [[Hibbert lectures]] on Babylonian religion;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sayce, Rev. Archibald Henry|journal=Who's Who|year=1913|page=1782|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453201;view=1up;seq=1816}}</ref> in 1902 his [[Gifford lectures]] on Egyptian and Babylonian religion; and in 1907 his [[Rhind lectures]].\n\nSayce was working at [[Eileithyiaspolis|El Kab]] in Egypt with [[Somers Clarke]] in the 1900s. In his seasonal winter digs in Egypt he always hired a well-furnished boat on the [[Nile]] to accommodate his travelling library, which also enabled him to offer tea to visiting Egyptologists like the young American [[James Henry Breasted]] and his wife.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n===Books===\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = Fresh light from the ancient monuments : a sketch of the most striking confirmations of the Bible, from recent discoveries in Egypt, Palestine, Assyria, Babylonia, Asia Minor\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = [[Religious Tract Society]]\n | series = [[By-paths of Bible Knowledge]]\n | volume = III\n | orig-year =\n | year = 1865\n | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroman00sayc\n |accessdate=2020-04-17}} ({{Citation | title = 2nd Edition | year = 1884 | publisher = Religious Tract Society | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroma01saycgoog|accessdate=2020-04-17}})({{Citation | title = 7th Edition | year = 1892 | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroman92sayc|accessdate=2020-04-17}})\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = The origin of Semitic civilisation, chiefly upon philological evidence\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Harrison & Sons\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1872\n | url = https://archive.org/details/originsemiticci00saycgoog\n |accessdate=2020-04-17\n }}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = An Assyrian grammar for comparative purposes\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Tr\u00fcbner & Co\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1872\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_WWAUAAAAYAAJ\n |accessdate=2020-04-17\n }}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = The principles of comparative philology\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Tr\u00fcbner & Co\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1874\n | url = https://archive.org/details/principlescompa06saycgoog\n |accessdate=2020-04-17}} ({{Citation |title = 4th Edition  | year = 1893 | publisher = Scribner | url = https://archive.org/details/cu31924026441729 |accessdate=2020-04-17}})\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = Archaic classics.

official archives<ref  name=CherryJP2Misc/> erroneously describe the  match as being one of the first round matches<br />\n2 * Wigan official archives<ref  name=CherryJP2Misc/> give the score as 36-5 but RUGBYLEAGUEproject<ref name=RLP.orgMisc/> and Warrington Wolves official archives<ref name=WiresMisc/> give it as 36-17<br />\n3  * [[Elland Road]],  [[Leeds]],  is the home ground of [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] with a capacity of 37,914 (The record attendance was 57,892 set on 15 March 1967 for a cup match Leeds v Sunderland). The ground was originally established in 1897 by [[Holbeck Rugby Club|Holbeck RLFC]] who played there until their demise after the conclusion of the 1903-04 season\n\n=== General information for those unfamiliar ===\nThe council of the [[Rugby Football League]] voted to introduce a new competition, to be similar to [[The Football Association]] and [[Scottish Football Association]]'s \"League Cup\". It was to be a similar knock-out structure to, and to be secondary to, the Challenge Cup. As this was being formulated, sports sponsorship was becoming more prevalent and as a result John Player and Sons, a division of Imperial Tobacco Company, became sponsors, and the competition never became widely known as the \"League Cup\" <br />\nThe competition ran from 1971-72 until 1995-96 and was initially intended for the professional clubs plus the two amateur [[British Amateur Rugby League Association|BARLA]] National Cup finalists. In later seasons the entries were expanded to take in other amateur and French teams. The competition was dropped due to \"fixture congestion\" when Rugby League became a summer sport\nThe Rugby League season always (until the onset of \"Summer Rugby\" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final usually taking place in late January <br />\nThe competition was variably known, by its sponsorship name, as the Player's No.6 Trophy (1971\u20131977), the John Player Trophy (1977\u20131983), the John Player Special Trophy (1983\u20131989), and the Regal Trophy in 1989.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[1982\u201383 Rugby Football League season]]\n*[[1982 Lancashire Cup]]\n*[[1982 Yorkshire Cup]]\n*[[League Cup (rugby league)|Player's No.6 Trophy]]\n*[[Rugby league county cups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=9 Saints Heritage Society]\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=319 1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season at wigan.rlfans.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302024838/http://www.hullfc.com/FixturesAndResults.aspx?sg=12&gi=3 Hull&Proud Fixtures & Results 1896/1897]\n*[http://www.rugby.widnes.tv/seasonreview.php?mid=1896&smid=1896-97&mids=1896 Widnes Vikings - One team, one passion Season In Review - 1896-97]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182311/http://www.warringtonwolves.org/HistoryB.ink The Northern Union at warringtonwolves.org]\n*[http://www.huddersfieldrlheritage.co.uk/Archive/Written/Players'%20Records.html Huddersfield R L Heritage]\n*[http://www.wakefieldtrinity-programmes.co.uk/page_2654162.html Wakefield until I die]\n\n{{League Cup (rugby league)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1982-83 John Player Trophy}}\n[[Category:1982 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:1983 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:League Cup (rugby league)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rugby football league season\n| title               = 1982\u201383 League Cup\n| structure           = National knockout championship\n| season_champs       = [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]\n| season_champ_name   = Winners\n| runner-up_name = Runner-up\n| second_place = [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]\n| prevseason_link     = 1981\u201382 League Cup (rugby league)\n| prevseason_year     = 1981\u201382\n| nextseason_link     = 1983\u201384 League Cup (rugby league)\n| nextseason_year     = 1983\u201384\n| no_of_teams         = 33\n}}\n\nThis was the twelfth season of the [[League Cup (rugby league)|League Cup]], which was known as the '''John Player Trophy''' for sponsorship purposes.\n\n[[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] claimed the trophy by beating [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] by the score of 22-11 in the final played at [[Elland Road]], [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]].

United A.F.C.]] with a capacity of 37,914 (The record attendance was 57,892 set on 15 March 1967 for a cup match Leeds v Sunderland). The ground was originally established in 1897 by [[Holbeck Rugby Club|Holbeck RLFC]] who played there until their demise after the conclusion of the 1903-04 season\n\n=== General information for those unfamiliar ===\nThe council of the [[Rugby Football League]] voted to introduce a new competition, to be similar to [[The Football Association]] and [[Scottish Football Association]]'s \"League Cup\". It was to be a similar knock-out structure to, and to be secondary to, the Challenge Cup. As this was being formulated, sports sponsorship was becoming more prevalent and as a result John Player and Sons, a division of Imperial Tobacco Company, became sponsors, and the competition never became widely known as the \"League Cup\" <br />\nThe competition ran from 1971-72 until 1995-96 and was initially intended for the professional clubs plus the two amateur [[British Amateur Rugby League Association|BARLA]] National Cup finalists. In later seasons the entries were expanded to take in other amateur and French teams. The competition was dropped due to \"fixture congestion\" when Rugby League became a summer sport\nThe Rugby League season always (until the onset of \"Summer Rugby\" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final usually taking place in late January <br />\nThe competition was variably known, by its sponsorship name, as the Player's No.6 Trophy (1971\u20131977), the John Player Trophy (1977\u20131983), the John Player Special Trophy (1983\u20131989), and the Regal Trophy in 1989.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[1982\u201383 Rugby Football League season]]\n*[[1982 Lancashire Cup]]\n*[[1982 Yorkshire Cup]]\n*[[League Cup (rugby league)|Player's No.6 Trophy]]\n*[[Rugby league county cups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=9 Saints Heritage Society]\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=319 1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season at wigan.rlfans.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302024838/http://www.hullfc.com/FixturesAndResults.aspx?sg=12&gi=3 Hull&Proud Fixtures & Results 1896/1897]\n*[http://www.rugby.widnes.tv/seasonreview.php?mid=1896&smid=1896-97&mids=1896 Widnes Vikings - One team, one passion Season In Review - 1896-97]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182311/http://www.warringtonwolves.org/HistoryB.ink The Northern Union at warringtonwolves.org]\n*[http://www.huddersfieldrlheritage.co.uk/Archive/Written/Players'%20Records.html Huddersfield R L Heritage]\n*[http://www.wakefieldtrinity-programmes.co.uk/page_2654162.html Wakefield until I die]\n\n{{League Cup (rugby league)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1982-83 John Player Trophy}}\n[[Category:1982 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:1983 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:League Cup (rugby league)]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_League_Cup_(rugby_league)"}

During the match Rocastle was sent off for retaliating to a tackle by United midfielder [[Norman Whiteside]], a move which caused a huge scuffle between several of the opposing players.

As so Rocastle won the Barclays Young Eagle award, being once again bestowed with the honour in 1989. Arsenal were however unable to compete in the 1989\u201390 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] because the ban on English clubs in European competition after the 1985 [[Heysel Stadium disaster|Heysel tragedy]] still had one year to run, but Rocastle would have the chance of playing in Europe's premier club competition twice over the next few seasons.

According to his teammate [[Martin Keown]] \"They couldn't work out why Rocastle was running around dribbling with his head down.

As so, just before his 20th birthday on 5 April 1987, he won a [[1986-87 Football League Cup|1986\u201387 League Cup]] winners medal as Arsenal beat [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2\u20131 in the cup final at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20151223/1986/87-league-cup|title=1986/87 League Cup|website=Arsenal.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> Due to his feats during this season, Rocastle was bestowed with the honour of being named in\n[[PFA Team of the Year (1980s)#1986.E2.80.9387|1987's]] [[PFA Team of the Year]] and as well won the 1987 Barclays Young Eagle award.<ref name=\"BYE\" /> In the following season, he was again an influential member of the Arsenal side which reached the [[1987-88 Football League Cup|1987\u201388 League Cup final]] against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] the following year. In the game Arsenal surrendered a 2\u20131 lead with only seven minutes of the final left to play, and ended up losing 3\u20132 to a last minute Luton goal.<ref name=\"arse\" /> He was also ever present for the Gunners in the [[1987-88 in English football|1987\u201388]] season, helping Arsenal win the [[Football League Centenary Trophy]] in a 2\u20131 win over [[Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.coupe.arsenal.manchester-united.92458.en.html|title=Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy 1988|website=Football Database.eu}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1987, Arsenal were away to [[Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]]. During the match Rocastle was sent off for retaliating to a tackle by United midfielder [[Norman Whiteside]], a move which caused a huge scuffle between several of the opposing players. This scenario has been illustrated by many as the start of the fierce rivalry [[Arsenal F.C.-Manchester United F.C. rivalry|which now exists between the two clubs]], especially as the two clubs being actively involved in competition for major honours almost every season since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/apr/11/thejoyofsixmanchesterutd|title=The Joy of Six: Manchester Utd v Arsenal showdowns|website=The Guardian.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904063951/https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/apr/11/thejoyofsixmanchesterutd|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-sparks-fly-when-two-football-empires-collide-vsqhxn9qph7|title=The sparks fly|website=The Times.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nRocastle's first league championship with Arsenal came in 1989, when he played in every game that season. Arsenal's success was sealed when they [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|beat Liverpool 2\u20130]] in the final game of the season at [[Anfield]], snatching the title from the hosts on goals scored. As so Rocastle won the Barclays Young Eagle award, being once again bestowed with the honour in 1989. Arsenal were however unable to compete in the 1989\u201390 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] because the ban on English clubs in European competition after the 1985 [[Heysel Stadium disaster|Heysel tragedy]] still had one year to run, but Rocastle would have the chance of playing in Europe's premier club competition twice over the next few seasons. Arsenal went on to finish fourth in the 1989\u201390 league season, missing out on a return to Europe as only the runners-up were entitled to a [[UEFA Cup]] place.<ref name=Book /><ref name=Sabah /><ref name=BYE1 />\n\nIn [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]], Rocastle was limited to just 18 league appearances due to a knee injury but he still played more than enough games to win another league title medal with Arsenal, who lost only one game that season. The following season, he played 39 league games for the Gunners and scored four league goals, also tasting European football for the first time as Arsenal reached the second round of the [[European Cup]].\n\nRocastle scored 34 goals and played 228 times in seven years for Arsenal, collecting two league title medals and a winner's medal in the League Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/players/david-rocastle-31883/|title=David Rocastle|website=11v11.com}}</ref>\n\n===Leeds United===\nOn 23 July 1992, Rocastle's decade at Arsenal came to an end when he was sold to reigning league champions [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], in a deal that several [[Arsenal F.C Supporters|Arsenal fans]], teammates and [[Association Football|football writers]] saw as doltish, cold and woeful. This view stemmed from the way in which the midfielder was dealt with by manager George Graham, given his fine performances and return to fitness during 1991\u201392, his general popularity and the player's stated opposition to the deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-rocastles-move-to-leeds-leaves-room-for-thomas-1535030.html|title= Football: Rocastle's move to Leeds leaves room for Thomas|website= The Independent.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/3816|title=Anders Limpar and an insight into the sale of David Rocastle|website=Woolwich Arsenal.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/david-rocastle-tribute-universally-popular-3304915|title=David Rocastle Tribute Universally Popular|website=Daily Mirror.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe player's arrival at Leeds United made him, up to that point, the club's' most expensive signing at up to \u00a32&nbsp;million. Manager [[Howard Wilkinson]] saw Rocastle as an eventual replacement for the veteran midfielder [[Gordon Strachan]]. However, Strachan would go on to spend nearly three more years at [[Elland Road]] and remained a regular first team player for two more seasons, by which time Rocastle had left the [[West Yorkshire]] club.\n\nWith Leeds, a 25-year-old Rocastle entered the first-ever [[Premier League]] by winning the [[1992 FA Charity Shield]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].<ref name=Eurosport /> He went on to make his debut for the club in a [[European Cup]] tie away to [[Bundesliga]] side [[VFB Stuttgart]]. Rocastle soon became a club favourite with him often being stylish and skillful upon the field of play.\nRocastle as well scored in a 4\u20131 league victory over club rivals Chelsea in November 1993, although he missed a large number of games due to injury problems. He went on to play a total of 34 games for Leeds, scoring two goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-nostalgia-rocastle-was-unable-to-knock-strachan-out-1-7412635/amp|title=Leeds United nostalgia|website=Yorkshire Evening Post.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leedsunited.com/newsmobile/team-news/17514/david-rocastle|title=David Rocastle|website=Leeds United.com}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester City===\nHe was at the club until December 1993, when he moved to [[Maine Road]] for \u00a32&nbsp;million as replacement for [[David White (English footballer)|David White]], who in turn had joined Leeds earlier that month.\n\nIn going to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] Rocastle scored two goals from 21 Premier League games as City finished 16th \u2013 their lowest finish since winning promotion to the top flight in 1989. At the end of the season, manager [[Brian Horton]] signed the [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] winger [[Nicky Summerbee]], putting Rocastle's future at [[Maine Road]] in doubt.\n\n===Chelsea===\nJust before the start of the 1994\u201395 season, Rocastle returned to [[London]] when he signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in a \u00a31.25&nbsp;million deal.
