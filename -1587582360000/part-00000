There is clear historical evidence of trade and commerce ties with [[Egypt]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Sumer]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the time period of 1000 to 750 BC.<ref name=\"mapsofindia.com\" /><ref>S. R. Rao (1985). Lothal. Archaeological Survey of India. p. 11.</ref> There was a succession of [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] states such as the [[Mauryan Dynasty]], [[Western Satraps]], [[Satavahana dynasty]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Chalukya dynasty]], [[Rashtrakuta Empire]], [[Pala Empire]] and [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] Empire, as well as local dynasties such as the [[Maitraka]]s and then the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukyas]].\n\nThe early history of Gujarat reflects the imperial grandeur of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] who conquered a number of earlier states in what is now Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a [[Vaishya]], was appointed the governor of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day [[Junagadh]]) (322 BC to 294 BC) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake.  Emperor [[Ashoka]], the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at [[Junagadh]] but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of [[Ujjain]], there was an [[Indo-Greek]] defeat in Gujarat of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]].  In 16th century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with [[Apostle Thomas]].  The incident of the cup-bearer torn apart by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.<ref>The Acts of Judas Thomas, M.R. James, Tr. by M.R.

The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (AD 100) of the Saka satraps known as [[Western Satraps]], or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the south Indian [[Satavahana dynasty]] and the Western Satraps.\nThe greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century AD.<ref>Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99</ref>\n\n[[File:Gujuras of Sindh Circa AD 570-712.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of the Gujuras of [[Sindh]], [[Chavda dynasty]], circa AD 570\u2013712.

Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (AD 450) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 he set up what came to be known as the [[Maitraka]] state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast.

He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, [[Jehangir]], was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at [[Ahmedabad]]. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and was amongst the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers, with an annual yearly tribute of \u00a338,624,680 (in 1690). During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100\u2013150 million subjects.\n\nAurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace.

The term of office for a member of the Legislative Assembly is five years. The Legislative Assembly elects a speaker who presides over the meetings of the legislature. A governor is appointed by the [[President of India]], and is to address the state legislature after every general election and the commencement of each year's first session of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislature (Chief Minister) or his or her designee acts as the Leader of the Legislative Assembly.

In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led by [[Keshubhai Patel]] who became the Chief Minister. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by [[Shankersinh Vaghela]]. BJP again won election in 1998 with clear majority. In 2001, following the loss of two assembly seats in by-elections, Keshubhai Patel resigned and yielded power to Narendra Modi. BJP retained a majority in the 2002 election, and Narendra Modi remained as Chief Minister.

As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002\u201303, Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries, amongst others.\n\nThe adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy [[cooperative]]s. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of [[Maharashtra]] and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebrahim|first=Alnoor|title=Agricultural cooperatives in Gujarat, India: Agents of equity or differentiation?|journal=Development in Practice|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=178\u2013188|doi=10.1080/09614520050010214}}</ref> An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of [[Amul]] (Anand Milk Union Limited).\n\n[[File:Amul Plant at Anand.jpg|thumb|right|Amul Plant at Anand]]\nAmul Was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bellur |first=Venkatakrishna |author2=Saraswathi P.

As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has \"safe\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gulati|first=Ashok|title=Agriculture performance in Gujarat since 2000|year=2009|publisher=International Water Management Institute & International Food Policy Research Institute|page=10|url=http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20&%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221231/http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20%26%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. One megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=D.C.|title=India Launches Solar Power Project|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=June 2012|volume=10|issue=5|page=230|url=http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013|doi=10.1890/i1540-9295-10-5-228|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012554/http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Government of Gujarat, to improve [[soil management]] and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a [[Soil Health Card]].

The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji which is in the Danta Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45&nbsp;km away), Palanpur (65&nbsp;km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5&nbsp;million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.\n\nThe [[Tarnetar]] Fair is held during the first week of ''Bhadrapad'', (September\u2013October according to [[Gregorian calendar]]), and mostly serves as a place to find a suitable bride for tribal people from Gujarat.

Pushyagupta, a [[Vaishya]], was appointed the governor of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day [[Junagadh]]) (322 BC to 294 BC) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake.  Emperor [[Ashoka]], the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at [[Junagadh]] but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of [[Ujjain]], there was an [[Indo-Greek]] defeat in Gujarat of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]].

The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (AD 100) of the Saka satraps known as [[Western Satraps]], or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the south Indian [[Satavahana dynasty]] and the Western Satraps.\nThe greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century AD.<ref>Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99</ref>\n\n[[File:Gujuras of Sindh Circa AD 570-712.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of the Gujuras of [[Sindh]], [[Chavda dynasty]], circa AD 570\u2013712.

Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (AD 450) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 he set up what came to be known as the [[Maitraka]] state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining [[Malwa]]. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted [[Nalanda university|Nalanda University]].

He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, [[Jehangir]], was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at [[Ahmedabad]]. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and was amongst the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers, with an annual yearly tribute of \u00a338,624,680 (in 1690). During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100\u2013150 million subjects.\n\nAurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat.\n\nIn his letter, Aurangzeb wrote:<ref>{{cite web|title=Aurangzeb loved Dahod till the end|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1682952/report-aurangzeb-loved-dahod-till-the-end|publisher=dnaindia.com|accessdate=4 October 2013|author=Ashish Vashi|date=1 May 2012|quote=Eminent historian Manekshah Commissariat has quoted from this letter in his book 'A History of Gujarat: Mughal period, from 1573 to 1758'.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927142458/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1682952/report-aurangzeb-loved-dahod-till-the-end|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{bquote| My son of exalted rank, the town of Dahod, one of the dependencies of Gujarat, is the birthplace of this sinner.

As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002\u201303, Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries, amongst others.\n\nThe adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy [[cooperative]]s. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of [[Maharashtra]] and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebrahim|first=Alnoor|title=Agricultural cooperatives in Gujarat, India: Agents of equity or differentiation?|journal=Development in Practice|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=178\u2013188|doi=10.1080/09614520050010214}}</ref> An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of [[Amul]] (Anand Milk Union Limited).\n\n[[File:Amul Plant at Anand.jpg|thumb|right|Amul Plant at Anand]]\nAmul Was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bellur |first=Venkatakrishna |author2=Saraswathi P.

As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has \"safe\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gulati|first=Ashok|title=Agriculture performance in Gujarat since 2000|year=2009|publisher=International Water Management Institute & International Food Policy Research Institute|page=10|url=http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20&%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221231/http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20%26%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. One megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=D.C.|title=India Launches Solar Power Project|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=June 2012|volume=10|issue=5|page=230|url=http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013|doi=10.1890/i1540-9295-10-5-228|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012554/http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Government of Gujarat, to improve [[soil management]] and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a [[Soil Health Card]].

The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway.

The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5&nbsp;million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world.
