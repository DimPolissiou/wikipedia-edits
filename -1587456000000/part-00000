At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST).

Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Leader [[Don Chipp]], and Tasmanian state Democrat [[Norm Sanders]], played important roles in the [[Franklin Dam controversy]] in the early 1980s.\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1977\u20131986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===\nThe Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties.

Millhouse held his seat ([[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]]) at the [[1977 South Australian state election|1977]] and [[1979 South Australian state election|1979]] state elections. In 1982, Millhouse resigned to take up a senior judicial appointment, and [[Heather Southcott]] won the [[1982 Mitcham state by-election|by-election]] for the Democrats, but lost the seat to the Liberals later that year at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower-house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.\n\nThe first Democrat federal parliamentarian was Senator [[Janine Haines]], who in 1977 was nominated by the South Australian Parliament to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Liberal Senator [[Steele Hall]].<ref name=\"aph.gov.au\"/> Hall had been elected as a [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]] senator, before rejoining the Liberal Party in 1976, and South Australian premier [[Don Dunstan]] nominated Haines on the basis that the Democrats was the successor party to the Liberal Movement.<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-26/the-urge-to-merge---family-first-and-the-australian-conservative/9388904 The Urge to merge - Family First and the Australian Conservatives], [[Antony Green]], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], 20 March 2018</ref>\n\nAt the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 election]], the Australian Democrats secured two seats in the Senate with the election of Colin Mason (NSW) and Don Chipp (VIC), though Haines lost her seat in South Australia. At the [[1980 Australian federal election|1980 election]], this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the return of Janine Haines (SA).

The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support.

No Democrat senators were elected, though four kept their seats due to being elected in 2001, so they representation fell from eight senators to four. Three incumbent senators were defeated: [[Aden Ridgeway]] (NSW), [[Brian Greig]] (WA) and [[John Cherry (Australian politician)|John Cherry]] (Qld).

At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as [[Centrism|centrists]], occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party.\n\nThe party was formally deregistered in 2016 for not having the required 500 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/democrats.htm|title=The Australian Democrats|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the Australian Democrats merged with [[CountryMinded|Country Minded]], an Australian political party seeking accountable regional and agricultural representation.<ref name=chan>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/11/alex-turnbull-would-fund-moderate-independents-to-fight-abbott-and-joyce|title=Alex Turnbull would fund moderate independents to fight Abbott and Joyce|last=Chan|first=Gabrielle|date=2018-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref> \nOn 7 April 2019 the merged entity regained registration of the name \"Australian Democrats\" with the Australian Electoral Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/index.htm|title=Party registration decisions and changes|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref> The party unsuccessfully contested the lower-house seat of Adelaide and a total of six Senate seats (two in each state of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia)<ref>[https://www.australian-democrats.org.au/our-candidates/ Our candidates].

Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Leader [[Don Chipp]], and Tasmanian state Democrat [[Norm Sanders]], played important roles in the [[Franklin Dam controversy]] in the early 1980s.\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum.

It is located 4 km to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and [[Montreal]] on Via Rail's [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Corridor]] Route. \n\n==Location==\nOttawa station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. \n\nSouth of the station building, trains call at 5 low-level [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks. The platforms are connected to the main building by an underground walkway that is accessed by a circular ramp and escalators. The tracks are bordered on the south by Terminal Avenue.\n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Services==\nThe station is staffed and offers ticket sales, checked baggage and checkroom service, bicycle box service, an ATM, a restaurant, vending machines, wifi (in the station and business lounge), telephones and washrooms.\n\nOttawa Station is also linked to local public transportation by [[OC Transpo]]'s [[Tremblay station|Tremblay LRT Station]] north of the main entrance. Located on the [[Confederation Line]], trains travel west to [[downtown Ottawa]] (stopping at [[Rideau station]], [[Parliament station]] and [[Lyon station]]) and east in the direction of the [[Blair station]] terminus.\n\nA taxi stand is located outside the main entrance and short-term parking lots operated by Park Indigo are available on the east and west sides of the station. A Discount Car & Truck Rentals kiosk is also located north of the station. \n\nThe station is wheelchair accessible including the ticket office, washrooms and trains. Wheelchairs, an elevator and a wheelchair lift are available.\n\n==Structure==\nOttawa station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B.

It was tested by customers who pre-ordered the 2014 Bethesda game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'' and also by the general public. [[Mick Gordon (composer)|Mick Gordon]] composed the music for the game, with additional music contributed by Ben F. Carney, Chris Hite, and Chad Mossholder.\n\nPlayers take the role of an [[Doomguy|unnamed space marine]] as he battles demonic forces from [[Hell]] that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation on a future-set colonized planet [[Mars]]. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower [[survival horror]] approach of ''Doom 3''. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as \"glory kills\". The game also supports an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as \"SnapMap\", co-developed with [[Certain Affinity]]{{efn|[[BattleCry Studios]] has since taken over Certain Affinity's development duties.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Mike|title=BattleCry devs now working with id on Doom multiplayer|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/443533/BattleCry+devs+now+working+with+id+on+Doom+multiplayer/|website=www.gamereactor.eu|publisher=[[Gamereactor]]|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref>}} and [[Escalation Studios]], respectively.\n\n''Doom'' was well-received by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay received considerable praise, with reviewers crediting the game for recapturing the spirit of the classic ''Doom'' games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK a few weeks after its release and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same time period. A sequel titled ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' was announced at [[E3 2018]] for Nintendo Switch, Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and was released on March 20, 2020, with the Nintendo Switch port coming later in 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Single-player===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Output OK1Cm5.gif|thumb|left|250px|An animation of the [[Doom Slayer]] sawing two Imps, and the player gaining ammunition]] -->\n\nAccording to the game's executive producer [[Marty Stratton]], the key principles of ''Doom''{{'}}s single-player mode are \"badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/hands-on-dooms-coolest-new-gun-is-powered-by-sprinting/|title=Hands-on: ''Doom''{{'}}s coolest new gun is powered by sprinting|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=October 20, 2016|first=Ian|last=Birnbaum|work=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> The game allows players to perform movements such as double jumps and ledge climbs throughout levels of industrial and corporate fields of a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on [[Mars]] and then levels of Hell,<ref name=gi-gruesome>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/01/11/video-the-gruesome-art-design-of-doom.aspx|title=The Gruesome Level Design Of ''Doom''|first=Wade|last=Wojcik|work=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}</ref> as the combat system puts emphasis upon momentum and speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/doom-revealed-at-quakecon-2014-and-heres-what-we-saw/|title=Doom revealed at QuakeCon 2014, and here's what we saw|first=Ian|last= Birnbaum |date=July 18, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> The approach is known as \"push-forward combat\", which discourages players from taking cover behind obstacles or [[Health (games)#Regenerating health|resting to regain health]] while playing from the [[Doom Slayer]] 's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/08/06/doom-cant-afford-to-let-you-hang-back/|title=''DOOM'' can\u2019t afford to let you hang back|first=Sherif|last=Saed|publisher=[[VG247]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=October 21, 2016}}</ref> Players instead collect health and armor pick-ups by killing enemies. \"Glory Kills\" is a newly-introduced melee execution system; when enough damage has been dealt to an enemy, the game will highlight it and allow the player to perform a quick and violent melee takedown, rewarding the player with small health recovery.<ref name=glory-kills/>\n\nThe fights also require the player to develop simple tactics.

Among them is a [[sarcophagus]] containing the [[Doomguy|Doom Slayer]] (along with his Praetor Suit), who the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.\n\nThe facility is overrun by demons after one of Hayden's researchers, Olivia Pierce, makes a pact with them and uses the Tower to open a portal to Hell.<ref name=vb-plot/> In desperation, Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights his way through the overrun facility, where he realigns a comms satellite dish to get a lay of the land, all guided by the AI VEGA. After clearing out the facility core and preventing a meltdown, he pursues Pierce as she destroys the energy induction filters to Hayden's objections. He pursues Pierce up the tower, where she uses an Argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into Hell, destroying the Tower, and where the Slayer is sent back. \n\nFighting his way to a teleporter, the Doom Slayer returns to Mars and makes his way to a tram leading to Hayden. Hayden informs the Slayer of the Helix Stone, an artifact used to study and harness Hell's energy. Entering the Lazarus labs, he observes the Helix Stone, and he learns of the Well, where the portal is powered, and of the magical key-like blade, the Crucible. He makes another excursion into Hell after battling and defeating a contained Cyberdemon and activating its accumulator, and fights through a labyrinthine gauntlet to recover the Crucible from a trio of Hell Guards. Arriving at VEGA's facility in the frozen north, he destroys the AI (while also making a backup copy), using its power to enter the Well, where he uses the Crucible to destroy the portal's power source.

whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that ''Doom'' was a successful return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on [[Metacritic]]. The Nintendo Switch edition, released in November 2017, was also positively received by professional reviewers, garnering a 79/100 on Metacritic: most reviewers praised the job of the port, also conceding that it's not as well-optimized as it was for previous consoles. The final version of the game received very positive reviews from users on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-18-the-new-doom-turns-around-steam-user-reviews|title=The new Doom campaign turns around Steam user reviews|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> It also received praise from other video game creators, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-designer-cliff-bleszinski-praises-new/1100-6439815/|title=Gears of War Designer Cliff Bleszinski Praises New Doom, But Has One Criticism|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref> and [[Greg Kasavin]], who said that the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/why-is-the-new-doom-so-important-it-asks-the-questions-other-shooters-aren-t-argues-supergiant-dev/0220857|title=Why is the new Doom so important?

Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun favorably compared ''Doom'' to the 2014 game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', also published by Bethesda, but added that ''Doom''{{'}}s quality surpassed that of ''Wolfenstein'' due to its fast pace and solid gunplay.<ref name=\"rockpapershotgun\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/16/doom-review-pc/|title=Wot I Think: DOOM (Singleplayer)|last=Meer|first=Alec|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Peter Brown of [[GameSpot]] praised single-player because he thought that the reboot captured the spirits of the older games, while refining them with modern elements. Brown also drew attention toward the soundtrack, calling it \"impactful\".<ref name=\"gamespotreview\"/> Gary Jones in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' felt that the game had one of the best single-player campaigns made for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, successfully combining the traditional gameplay of the series with a very fast pace.<ref name=dereview>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/672439/DOOM-Review-Xbox-One-Bethesda-PS4|title=''DOOM'' Review: The best single-player FPS action on Xbox One and PS4|last=Jones|first=Gary|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=[[Express Newspapers]]|date=May 21, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Mike Henriquez of [[Game Revolution]] favored the visual and artistic design, calling it \"top-notch\".<ref name=\"gamerevreview\"/> Sam White in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commended id Software for ''Doom''{{'}}s delivery of performance on all platforms and praised the weapon design for ''Doom''{{'}}s continuity to introduce new weapons at a perfect speed so that gamers always play with something new and exciting.<ref name=ttreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/doom-review/|title=''Doom'' is a fiendishly moreish, impeccably refined shooter - review|first=Sam|last=White|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|date=May 23, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]{{'}}s Arthur Gies remarked positively upon the exploration for collectables and secrets, and their relevance to the new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning.<ref name=\"polygonreview\"/> Zack Furniss of [[Destructoid]] was originally skeptical regarding the \"glory kills\" feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well in the flow of gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace.<ref name=\"destructoidreview\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]{{'}}s Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor \"makes them an essential part of the give-and-take of ''Doom''{{'}}s super fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?\"<ref name=\"giantbombreview\"/> Conversely, Kyle Orland of [[Ars Technica]] felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.<ref name=\"arstechreview\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/|title=Doom (2016) single-player review: Back to basics|last=Orland|first=Kyle|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe SnapMap mode was also positively received with ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Jordan Helm's noting the possibilities yet simplicity with its use, calling it an \"admirable feat\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/05/17/review-doom/207490/|title=Doom Review (PS4)|last=Helm|first=Jordan|work=Hardcore Gamer|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' thought that the mode added further value to the overall package of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4336416/doom-review/|title=Review: The New \u2018Doom\u2019 Serves Up a Brew of Nostalgia and Carnage|last=Peckham|first=Matt|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' commented upon the accessibility but criticized the lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community-based [[mod (video games)|mod]].<ref name=\"gameinformerreview\"/> James Davenport of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' compared it to the modification in the original games, which he views as one of the primary reasons why ''Doom'' is still a recognizable title.

IGN's Joab Gilory was less favorable toward the multiplayer, calling the overall game \"a tale of two very different shooters\", stating that multiplayer did not live up to the standard set by the single-player components and would not satisfy players.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Simon Miller of ''VideoGamer.com'' found the multiplayer to be only all right.<ref name=\"videogamer.comreview\"/> Matt Buchholtz of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' criticized what he felt was the network's poor handling of latency, and failing to register on-target shots as hits in some instances while not in others.<ref name=\"egmreview\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of [[Eurogamer]] singled out the \"Warpath\" multiplayer mode as the most interesting of the match type, describing it as \"memorable\", while

It was released worldwide on [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in May 2016 and is powered by [[id Tech 6]]. A port for [[Nintendo Switch]] was co-developed with [[Panic Button (company)|Panic Button]] and released in November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stevivor.com/news/doom-on-switch-runs-at-30-fps-has-9gb-multiplayer-download/|title=DOOM on Switch runs at 30 FPS, has 9GB multiplayer download|publisher=Stevivor}}</ref> A reboot of the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' franchise]], it is the fourth title in the main series and the first major installment since ''[[Doom 3]]'' in 2004.\n\n''Doom'' was announced as \"''Doom 4''\" in 2008, and that version underwent an extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before the game was restarted in 2011 and revealed as simply \"''Doom''\" in 2014. It was tested by customers who pre-ordered the 2014 Bethesda game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'' and also by the general public. [[Mick Gordon (composer)|Mick Gordon]] composed the music for the game, with additional music contributed by Ben F. Carney, Chris Hite, and Chad Mossholder.\n\nPlayers take the role of an [[Doomguy|unnamed space marine]] as he battles demonic forces from [[Hell]] that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation on a future-set colonized planet [[Mars]]. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower [[survival horror]] approach of ''Doom 3''. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as \"glory kills\". The game also supports an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as \"SnapMap\", co-developed with [[Certain Affinity]]{{efn|[[BattleCry Studios]] has since taken over Certain Affinity's development duties.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Mike|title=BattleCry devs now working with id on Doom multiplayer|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/443533/BattleCry+devs+now+working+with+id+on+Doom+multiplayer/|website=www.gamereactor.eu|publisher=[[Gamereactor]]|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref>}} and [[Escalation Studios]], respectively.\n\n''Doom'' was well-received by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay received considerable praise, with reviewers crediting the game for recapturing the spirit of the classic ''Doom'' games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK a few weeks after its release and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same time period. A sequel titled ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' was announced at [[E3 2018]] for Nintendo Switch, Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and was released on March 20, 2020, with the Nintendo Switch port coming later in 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Single-player===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Output OK1Cm5.gif|thumb|left|250px|An animation of the [[Doom Slayer]] sawing two Imps, and the player gaining ammunition]] -->\n\nAccording to the game's executive producer [[Marty Stratton]], the key principles of ''Doom''{{'}}s single-player mode are \"badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/hands-on-dooms-coolest-new-gun-is-powered-by-sprinting/|title=Hands-on: ''Doom''{{'}}s coolest new gun is powered by sprinting|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=October 20, 2016|first=Ian|last=Birnbaum|work=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> The game allows players to perform movements such as double jumps and ledge climbs throughout levels of industrial and corporate fields of a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on [[Mars]] and then levels of Hell,<ref name=gi-gruesome>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/01/11/video-the-gruesome-art-design-of-doom.aspx|title=The Gruesome Level Design Of ''Doom''|first=Wade|last=Wojcik|work=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}</ref> as the combat system puts emphasis upon momentum and speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/doom-revealed-at-quakecon-2014-and-heres-what-we-saw/|title=Doom revealed at QuakeCon 2014, and here's what we saw|first=Ian|last= Birnbaum |date=July 18, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> The approach is known as \"push-forward combat\", which discourages players from taking cover behind obstacles or [[Health (games)#Regenerating health|resting to regain health]] while playing from the [[Doom Slayer]] 's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/08/06/doom-cant-afford-to-let-you-hang-back/|title=''DOOM'' can\u2019t afford to let you hang back|first=Sherif|last=Saed|publisher=[[VG247]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=October 21, 2016}}</ref> Players instead collect health and armor pick-ups by killing enemies. \"Glory Kills\" is a newly-introduced melee execution system; when enough damage has been dealt to an enemy, the game will highlight it and allow the player to perform a quick and violent melee takedown, rewarding the player with small health recovery.<ref name=glory-kills/>\n\nThe fights also require the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter.

Recurring weapons of the series also make a return, including the super shotgun and [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]]. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity, but is extremely powerful.

Many of these collectibles can be used as part of ''Doom''{{'}}s progression system, including weapon mods, rune powers, and Praetor Suit upgrades. Weapon points come from field drones and allow the player to unlock alternate modes of fire for many weapons, such as explosive shots and different rate and output of firepower. Each of the weapons' firing modes can be further upgraded using weapon tokens, but they can only be maxed out by completing a challenge related to that particular firing mode. Runes transport the player to a separate arena to perform a combat challenge that grants different abilities when successfully completed, such as better equipment drops from fallen enemies. Players can also upgrade their \"Praetor Suit\" by retrieving special tokens from dead marines and using them to improve functionality such as equipment, navigation and resistances.<ref name=pg-custom>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/11/11657360/doom-trailer-campaign-progression-system|title=''Doom'' developers explain the campaign's progression system|first=Samit|last=Sarkar|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> Other pickups include small [[Doomguy]] figurines that allow the player to view 3D models of different characters, and data files that expand on the characters and story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/05/surprise-dooms-campaign-is-actually-fun/|title=Surprise, DOOM's Campaign Is Actually Fun|first=Alex|last=Walker|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, each of the game's levels contains a hidden lever which opens an area extracted from a classic level in the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' or ''[[Doom II]]''.

To accommodate this new progression system, Update 6.66 also reset all players' multiplayer experience progression, but not without giving players the option whether to retain all unlocked items or reset them.

If they are not connected together, the color of the construction pieces changes to notify the player. Players can also use the X-ray camera which temporarily removes all the walls to allow players to view the objects inside. Players can also place enemies into their maps, with the exception of the campaign's [[boss (video games)|bosses]]. Their [[artificial intelligence]] and stats, and the player's own movement speed can also be modified.

Researchers at the UAC facility have attempted to draw energy from Hell, an alternative dimension inhabited by demons, in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from Hell.<ref name=vb-plot>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> To supplement their work, Hayden organizes several expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. Among them is a [[sarcophagus]] containing the [[Doomguy|Doom Slayer]] (along with his Praetor Suit), who the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.\n\nThe facility is overrun by demons after one of Hayden's researchers, Olivia Pierce, makes a pact with them and uses the Tower to open a portal to Hell.<ref name=vb-plot/> In desperation, Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights his way through the overrun facility, where he realigns a comms satellite dish to get a lay of the land, all guided by the AI VEGA. After clearing out the facility core and preventing a meltdown, he pursues Pierce as she destroys the energy induction filters to Hayden's objections. He pursues Pierce up the tower, where she uses an Argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into Hell, destroying the Tower, and where the Slayer is sent back. \n\nFighting his way to a teleporter, the Doom Slayer returns to Mars and makes his way to a tram leading to Hayden. Hayden informs the Slayer of the Helix Stone, an artifact used to study and harness Hell's energy. Entering the Lazarus labs, he observes the Helix Stone, and he learns of the Well, where the portal is powered, and of the magical key-like blade, the Crucible. He makes another excursion into Hell after battling and defeating a contained Cyberdemon and activating its accumulator, and fights through a labyrinthine gauntlet to recover the Crucible from a trio of Hell Guards. Arriving at VEGA's facility in the frozen north, he destroys the AI (while also making a backup copy), using its power to enter the Well, where he uses the Crucible to destroy the portal's power source. Finally, he confronts Pierce, who is transformed by the demons into the monstrous Spider Mastermind, and kills her.\n\nUpon the Doom Slayer's return to Mars, Hayden confiscates the Crucible, which he plans to use in his research. Despite all that has happened, he insists that Earth is too desperate for energy to give up. To keep the Doom Slayer from interfering with his plans, Hayden teleports him to an undisclosed location, saying that they [[Doom Eternal|will meet again]].\n\n==Development==\n===As ''Doom 4''===\n[[File:A screenshot of the canned Doom 4.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of the canceled ''Doom 4'', which showcased a more urban environment than its predecessors]]\n\n[[John Carmack]], co-founder of and then lead developer at [[id Software]], indicated that ''Doom 4'' was in development at [[QuakeCon]] on August 3, 2007.<ref name=\"carmackrage\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2|title=QuakeCon 2007: John Carmack Talks ''Rage'', Id Tech 5 And More|last=Berghammer|first=Billy|date=August 3, 2007|work=Game Informer|accessdate=August 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050912/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2|archivedate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> It was announced in May 2008.<ref name=\"ign_announce\">{{cite web |last=Ocampo |first=Jason |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/872/872097p1.html |title=''Doom 4'' Announced|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> Id Software CEO [[Todd Hollenshead]] suggested that like ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', the game would take place on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/DOOM-4-Rage-FPS-John-Carmack-id-Tech-5,14837.html|title=Are These Really ''Doom 4'' Screenshots?|first=Kevin|last=Parrish|work=[[Tom's Hardware]]|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Carmack stated that it would feature gameplay more akin to the original ''Doom'' games rather than the [[survival horror]] gameplay of ''[[Doom 3]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/85484-John-Carmack-Sheds-Some-Light-On-Doom-4 |title=John Carmack Sheds Some Light On Doom 4 |first=Andy|last=Chalk|date=August 6, 2008|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|publisher=[[Defy Media]]|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Carmack claimed that Doom 4 would look \"three times better\" than ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'' even though it was intended to run at 30 frames per second on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, rather than the 60 that ''Rage'' was targeting.<ref name=1up-new>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/doom-game-announced|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714131428/http://www.1up.com/news/doom-game-announced|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2012|title=Next ''Doom'' Game Announced|first=Philip|last=Kollar|work=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> It was planned to run at 60 frames per second on Windows with state-of-the-art hardware.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/quakecon_08_quake_live_will_have_no_mod_support_doom_4_run_60hz_pc_locked_30hz_consoles | title=QuakeCon 08: Quake Live Will Have No Mod Support; Doom 4 to Run at 60Hz on PC, Locked at 30Hz for Consoles |date=July 31, 2008 |first=Norman|last=Chan|publisher=[[Maximum PC]]|accessdate=November 30, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628192231/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/quakecon_08_quake_live_will_have_no_mod_support_doom_4_run_60hz_pc_locked_30hz_consoles|archivedate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Carmack also stated that the game was running on the [[id Tech 5]] game engine.<ref name=1up-new/> In 2009, he revealed that the multiplayer component was being developed separately and would run at 60 frames per second.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Ge-35Ld70 | title=John Carmack on Rage |date=July 2009 |work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=CD-Action |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> He stated in 2011 that \"you can't have 30 guys crawling all over you at 60 frames per second at this graphics technology level because it's painful.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318725/e3-2011-john-carmack-talks-wii-u-playstation-vita-and-next-gen-rage |title=E3 2011: John Carmack talks Wii U, PlayStation Vita, and next-gen Rage|date=June 9, 2011|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 9, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128080308/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318725/e3-2011-john-carmack-talks-wii-u-playstation-vita-and-next-gen-rage|archivedate=January 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, Hollenshead said that ''Doom 4'' was \"deep in development\".

whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that ''Doom'' was a successful return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on [[Metacritic]]. The Nintendo Switch edition, released in November 2017, was also positively received by professional reviewers, garnering a 79/100 on Metacritic: most reviewers praised the job of the port, also conceding that it's not as well-optimized as it was for previous consoles. The final version of the game received very positive reviews from users on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-18-the-new-doom-turns-around-steam-user-reviews|title=The new Doom campaign turns around Steam user reviews|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> It also received praise from other video game creators, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-designer-cliff-bleszinski-praises-new/1100-6439815/|title=Gears of War Designer Cliff Bleszinski Praises New Doom, But Has One Criticism|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref> and [[Greg Kasavin]], who said that the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/why-is-the-new-doom-so-important-it-asks-the-questions-other-shooters-aren-t-argues-supergiant-dev/0220857|title=Why is the new Doom so important?

Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun favorably compared ''Doom'' to the 2014 game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', also published by Bethesda, but added that ''Doom''{{'}}s quality surpassed that of ''Wolfenstein'' due to its fast pace and solid gunplay.<ref name=\"rockpapershotgun\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/16/doom-review-pc/|title=Wot I Think: DOOM (Singleplayer)|last=Meer|first=Alec|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Peter Brown of [[GameSpot]] praised single-player because he thought that the reboot captured the spirits of the older games, while refining them with modern elements. Brown also drew attention toward the soundtrack, calling it \"impactful\".<ref name=\"gamespotreview\"/> Gary Jones in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' felt that the game had one of the best single-player campaigns made for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, successfully combining the traditional gameplay of the series with a very fast pace.<ref name=dereview>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/672439/DOOM-Review-Xbox-One-Bethesda-PS4|title=''DOOM'' Review: The best single-player FPS action on Xbox One and PS4|last=Jones|first=Gary|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=[[Express Newspapers]]|date=May 21, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Mike Henriquez of [[Game Revolution]] favored the visual and artistic design, calling it \"top-notch\".<ref name=\"gamerevreview\"/> Sam White in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commended id Software for ''Doom''{{'}}s delivery of performance on all platforms and praised the weapon design for ''Doom''{{'}}s continuity to introduce new weapons at a perfect speed so that gamers always play with something new and exciting.<ref name=ttreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/doom-review/|title=''Doom'' is a fiendishly moreish, impeccably refined shooter - review|first=Sam|last=White|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|date=May 23, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]{{'}}s Arthur Gies remarked positively upon the exploration for collectables and secrets, and their relevance to the new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning.<ref name=\"polygonreview\"/> Zack Furniss of [[Destructoid]] was originally skeptical regarding the \"glory kills\" feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well in the flow of gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace.<ref name=\"destructoidreview\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]{{'}}s Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor \"makes them an essential part of the give-and-take of ''Doom''{{'}}s super fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?\"<ref name=\"giantbombreview\"/> Conversely, Kyle Orland of [[Ars Technica]] felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.<ref name=\"arstechreview\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/|title=Doom (2016) single-player review: Back to basics|last=Orland|first=Kyle|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe SnapMap mode was also positively received with ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Jordan Helm's noting the possibilities yet simplicity with its use, calling it an \"admirable feat\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/05/17/review-doom/207490/|title=Doom Review (PS4)|last=Helm|first=Jordan|work=Hardcore Gamer|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' thought that the mode added further value to the overall package of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4336416/doom-review/|title=Review: The New \u2018Doom\u2019 Serves Up a Brew of Nostalgia and Carnage|last=Peckham|first=Matt|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' commented upon the accessibility but criticized the lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community-based [[mod (video games)|mod]].<ref name=\"gameinformerreview\"/> James Davenport of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' compared it to the modification in the original games, which he views as one of the primary reasons why ''Doom'' is still a recognizable title.

IGN's Joab Gilory was less favorable toward the multiplayer, calling the overall game \"a tale of two very different shooters\", stating that multiplayer did not live up to the standard set by the single-player components and would not satisfy players.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Simon Miller of ''VideoGamer.com'' found the multiplayer to be only all right.<ref name=\"videogamer.comreview\"/> Matt Buchholtz of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' criticized what he felt was the network's poor handling of latency, and failing to register on-target shots as hits in some instances while not in others.<ref name=\"egmreview\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of [[Eurogamer]] singled out the \"Warpath\" multiplayer mode as the most interesting of the match type, describing it as \"memorable\", while

While waiting to be picked up, an owl takes her favorite witch book and she chases it into an abandoned house that transports her to the Boiling Isles, a magical realm in another dimension. She meets Eda, a fugitive witch who sells human items. Eda takes Luz to her home, the Owl House, where she introduces her to the adorably feisty King. Eda promises to take Luz back home if she helps them get King's crown back from Warden Wrath ([[Roger Craig Smith]]) at his prison, the Conformatorium. They successfully break in where Luz discovers that the \"crown\" is a kid's meal crown. Wrath captures them with the intent to ask Eda out on a date, but she refuses. A fight breaks out with Luz releasing the prisoners (whose crimes were for being different) and together defeat Wrath and escape. Luz decides to stay to become a witch and Eda reluctantly accepts.

Luz and King come across the brightly lit castle of a kindly wizard named Adegast ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]) who believes that Luz is the \"Chosen One\" who must retrieve the Celestial Staff. When Luz shows the map given to her by Adegast to Eda and King, they laugh at her. She leaves on her own for the quest just as Eda becomes suspicious and discovers the whole quest to be a ruse.

Before she drinks it however, a monster breaks into the house which King is convinced is the Snaggleback. He meets a real Snaggleback, which turns out to be a pathetic pink monkey wearing a shell. With Luz, King discover that the elixir was to prevent a curse from taking hold of Eda who is the real monster. With King's encouragement, Luz learns how to create light and uses it to sequester Eda and give her the elixir. Eda reveals that she was cursed when she was younger and it causes her to transform into an owl monster, hence her nickname \"The Owl Lady\". She tells them not to worry about it and compliments Luz's new ability. Eda later has a brief nightmare of a shadowy figure who cursed her, but wakes up before she can get answers.

Meanwhile, Luz discovers that Willow and Gus were uninvited to a Moonlight Conjuring by Amity and her friends and she agrees to bring them to the Owl House to have their own, despite Eda telling her not to. The three of them end up having the house grow legs and they learn to control it when they hold hands. Eda and King meet Tibbles who has the elixir, but it is expensive and Eda challenges him to Hexes Hold'em for the elixir. However, Eda loses and Tibbles reveals that he plans to hand Eda to the Emperor's Coven and keep King as a servant. The kids head to Amity to show her up, but a team of demon hunters grab the house and toss the kids over a cliff.

The third son of [[George III]], William succeeded his elder brother [[George IV]], becoming the last king and penultimate monarch of Britain's [[House of Hanover]].\n\nWilliam served in the [[Royal Navy]] in his youth, spending time in North America and the [[Caribbean]], and was later nicknamed the \"Sailor King\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Scots Greys | last = Staff writer | date = 25 January 1831 |work=The Times | location = UK | page = 3 | quote = ...they will have the additional honour of attending our \"Sailor King\"... }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Will of his late Majesty William IV | last = Staff writer | date = 29 June 1837 |work=The Times | location = UK | page = 5 | quote = ...ever since the accession of our sailor King... }}</ref> In 1789, he was created [[Duke of Clarence and St Andrews]]. In 1827, he was appointed as Britain's first [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom|Lord High Admiral]] since 1709. As his two older brothers died without leaving legitimate issue, he [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited the throne]] when he was 64 years old. His reign saw several reforms: the [[poor law]] was updated, [[child labour]] restricted, [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|slavery abolished]] in nearly all of the [[British Empire]], and the British electoral system refashioned by the [[Reform Act 1832]]. Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father, he was the last monarch to appoint a British prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution.\n\nAt the time of his death, William had no surviving legitimate children, but he was survived by eight of the ten illegitimate children he had by the actress [[Dorothea Jordan]], with whom he cohabited for twenty years. Late in life, he married and apparently remained faithful to the young princess who would become [[Queen Adelaide]]. William was succeeded by his niece [[Queen Victoria]] in the United Kingdom, and his brother [[King Ernest Augustus]] in Hanover.\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliam was born in the early hours of the morning on 21 August 1765 at [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]], the third child and son of [[King George III]] and [[Queen Charlotte]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 12.</ref> He had two elder brothers, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], and [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York|Frederick]] (later [[Duke of York]]), and was not expected to inherit the Crown. He was baptised in the Great Council Chamber of [[St James's Palace]] on 20 September 1765. His godparents were the King's siblings: [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]]; [[Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn|Prince Henry]] (later [[Duke of Cumberland]]); and [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Princess Augusta]], Hereditary Duchess of [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings | website = Yvonne's Royalty Home Page | title = Royal Christenings | access-date = 23 May 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806125845/http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings | archive-date = 6 August 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Prince William and Prince Edward 1778.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William aged thirteen (left) and his younger brother [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Edward]], painted by [[Benjamin West]], 1778]]\nHe spent most of his early life in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] and at [[Kew Palace]], where he was educated by private tutors.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 13\u201319.</ref> At the age of thirteen, he joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[midshipman]],<ref>Ziegler, pp. 23\u201331.</ref> and was present at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] in 1780.<ref>Allen, p. 29 and Ziegler, p. 32.</ref> His experiences in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by a tutor.

To put pressure on him, William threatened to stand for the [[British House of Commons]] for the constituency of [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes]] in Devon.

The Admiralty did not reply to his request.<ref>Ziegler, p. 94.</ref> He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post.

Watching the bombardment of [[Antwerp]] from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.<ref>Ziegler, p. 115.</ref>\n\nInstead of serving at sea, William spent time in the House of Lords, where he spoke in opposition to the [[abolition of slavery]], which although not legal in the United Kingdom still existed in the British colonies. Freedom would do the slaves little good, he argued. He had travelled widely and, in his eyes, the living standard among freemen in the [[Highlands and Islands]] of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the [[West Indies]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 54.</ref> His experience in the Caribbean, where he \"quickly absorbed the plantation owners' views about slavery\",<ref>Hochschild, p. 186.</ref> lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 97\u201399.</ref> In his first speech before Parliament he called himself \"an attentive observer of the state of the negroes\" who found them well cared for and \"in a state of humble happiness\".<ref>Hochschild, p. 187.</ref> Others thought it \"shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade\".<ref>[[Zachary Macaulay]] writing to Miss Mills, 1 June 1799, quoted in Ziegler, p. 98.</ref> In his speech to the House, William insulted [[William Wilberforce]], the leading abolitionist, saying: \"the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce\".<ref>Fulford, p. 121.</ref> On other issues he was more liberal, such as supporting moves to abolish [[Penal law (Britain)|penal laws]] against [[English Dissenters|dissenting Christians]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 99.</ref> He also opposed efforts to bar those found guilty of [[adultery]] from remarriage.<ref>Fulford, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n== Relationships and marriage ==\nFrom 1791 William lived with an Irish actress, [[Dorothea Bland]], better known by her stage name, Mrs. Jordan,<ref name=\"rh\" /> the title \"Mrs.\" being assumed at the start of her stage career to explain an inconvenient pregnancy<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 51.</ref> and \"Jordan\" because she had \"crossed the water\" from Ireland to Britain.<ref>Allen, p. 49 and Ziegler, p. 76.</ref> He appeared to enjoy the domesticity of his life with Mrs. Jordan, remarking to a friend: \"Mrs. Jordan is a very good creature, very domestic and careful of her children. To be sure she is absurd sometimes and has her humours. But there are such things more or less in all families.\" The couple, while living quietly, enjoyed entertaining, with Mrs. Jordan writing in late 1809: \"We shall have a full and merry house this Christmas, 'tis what the dear Duke delights in.\"<ref>Fulford, p. 125.</ref> George III was accepting of his son's relationship with the actress (though recommending that he halve her allowance);<ref>Ziegler, pp. 80\u201381.</ref> in 1797, he created William Ranger of [[Bushy Park]], which included a large residence, [[Bushy House]], for William's growing family.<ref>Somerset, p. 68.</ref> William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king.<ref>Allen, pp. 52\u201353 and Ziegler, p. 82.</ref> His London residence, [[Clarence House]], was constructed to the designs of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] between 1825 and 1827.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/royal-residences-clarence-house |title=Royal Residences: Clarence House|website=Official web site of the British monarchy|access-date=18 April 2016|date=4 April 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Dorothy Jordan00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Mrs. Jordan in the Character of Hypolita'', [[mezzotint]] by John Jones of London, 1791, after a painting by [[John Hoppner]]]]\n\nThe couple had ten illegitimate children\u2014five sons and five daughters\u2014nine of whom were named after William's siblings; each was given the surname \"[[FitzClarence]]\".<ref>Ziegler, p. 296.</ref><ref name=\"weir\">Weir, pp. 303\u2013304.</ref> Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811.

In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second in the line of succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate relatively frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was [[barley water]] flavoured with lemon.<ref>Ziegler, p. 130.</ref> Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered only a matter of time before he became king.<ref>Molloy, p. 9.</ref> When Frederick died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, [[George Canning]], appointed him to the office of [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom|Lord High Admiral]], which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of [[Admiralty]] officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remaining away for ten days. The King requested his resignation through the Prime Minister, the [[Duke of Wellington]]; he complied.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\nDespite the difficulties William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the [[cat o' nine tails]] for most offences other than [[mutiny]], attempted to improve the standard of naval gunnery, and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more.<ref>Ziegler, p. 141.</ref> Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them\u2014a process that might have been far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming king that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>Ziegler, p. 133.</ref>\n\nWilliam spent the remaining time during his brother's reign in the House of Lords. He supported the [[Catholic Emancipation]] Bill against the opposition of his younger brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], describing the latter's position on the Bill as \"infamous\", to Cumberland's outrage.<ref name=Ziegler143>Ziegler, p. 143.</ref> George IV's health was increasingly bad; it was obvious by early 1830 that he was near death. The King took his leave of his younger brother at the end of May, stating, \"God's will be done. I have injured no man. It will all rest on you then.\"<ref>Fulford, p. 137.</ref> William's genuine affection for his older brother could not mask his rising anticipation that he would soon be king.<ref name=Ziegler143/><ref>Allen, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early reign ===\n[[File:WilliamIVbyLonsdale.jpg|thumb|William IV in Masonic insignia. Portrait by [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]], 1830]]\nWhen King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without surviving legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was the oldest person yet to assume the British throne.<ref>Ashley, p. 3.</ref> Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended to spend most of his time in [[Windsor Castle]], William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or [[Brighton]]. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the people, who saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.<ref>Allen, pp. 83\u201386; Ziegler, pp. 150\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe King immediately proved himself a conscientious worker. The Prime Minister, Wellington, stated that he had done more business with King William in ten minutes than he had with George IV in as many days.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 179.</ref> [[Lord Brougham]] described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter\u2014whereas George IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.<ref>Somerset, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe King did his best to endear himself to the people. [[Charlotte Williams-Wynn (diarist)|Charlotte Williams-Wynn]] wrote shortly after his accession: \"Hitherto the King has been indefatigable in his efforts to make himself popular, and do good natured and amiable things in every possible instance.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 110.</ref> [[Emily Eden]] noted: \"He is an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal, who died growling sulkily in his den at Windsor. This man at least ''wishes'' to make everybody happy, and everything he has done has been benevolent.\"<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 178.</ref>\n\nWilliam dismissed his brother's French chefs and German band, replacing them with English ones to public approval. He gave much of George IV's art collection to the nation, and halved the royal [[Stud (animal)|stud]]. George had begun an extensive (and expensive) renovation of [[Buckingham Palace]]; William refused to reside there, and twice tried to give the palace away, once to the Army as a barracks, and once to Parliament after the [[Houses of Parliament]] burned down in 1834.<ref>Somerset, p. 110\u2013122.</ref> His informality could be startling: When in residence at the [[Royal Pavilion]] in Brighton, King William used to send to the hotels for a list of their guests and invite anyone he knew to dinner, urging guests not to \"bother about clothes. The Queen does nothing but embroider flowers after dinner.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 119f.</ref>\n\nUpon taking the throne, William did not forget his nine surviving illegitimate children, creating his eldest son [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|Earl of Munster]] and granting the other children the precedence of a daughter or a younger son of a marquess. Despite this, his children importuned for greater opportunities, disgusting elements of the press who reported that the \"impudence and rapacity of the FitzJordans is unexampled\".<ref>''Morning Post'' quoted in Ziegler, p. 158.</ref> The relationship between William and his sons \"was punctuated by a series of savage and, for the King at least, painful quarrels\" over money and honours.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 158\u2013159.</ref> His daughters, on the other hand, proved an ornament to his court, as, \"They are all, you know, pretty and lively, and make society in a way that real princesses could not.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 117.</ref>\n\n=== Reform crisis ===\nAt the time, the [[Demise of the Crown|death of the monarch]] required fresh elections and, in the [[1830 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1830]], Wellington's [[Tories]] lost ground to the Whigs under [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]] elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as [[rotten borough|rotten]] or [[pocket borough]]s\u2014such as [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] with just seven voters\u2014elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents\u2014who were, most often, their tenants\u2014especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 177\u2013180.</ref>\n[[File:Reformact1832cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|Political cartoon supporting the Reform Act: King William sits above the clouds, surrounded by Whig politicians; below [[Britannia]] and the British Lion cause the Tories to flee.]]\n\nWhen the House of Commons defeated the First Reform Bill in 1831, Grey's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which would lead to a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country was in a state of high excitement which might boil over into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, the King prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 182\u2013188.</ref> The monarch's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address.<ref name=Ziegler188>Ziegler, p. 188.</ref> When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, \"Then I will go in a [[hackney cab]]!\"<ref name=Ziegler188/> Coach and horses were assembled quickly and he immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said ''The Times'' of the scene before William's arrival, \"It is utterly impossible to describe the scene&nbsp;... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords&nbsp;... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm.\"<ref>Grant, p. 59, quoting ''The Times''</ref> [[Charles Stewart, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry|Lord Londonderry]] brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament.<ref>Allen, pp. 121\u2013122 and Ziegler, p. 189.</ref> This forced [[1831 United Kingdom general election|new elections for the House of Commons]], which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the Lords remained implacably opposed to it.<ref>Allen, pp. 124\u2013127; Ziegler, p. 190f.</ref>\n\nThe crisis saw a brief interlude for the celebration of the [[Coronation of the British monarch|King's Coronation]] on 8 September 1831. At first, William wished to dispense with the coronation entirely, feeling that his wearing the crown while proroguing Parliament answered any need.<ref>Allen, pp. 124, 130; Ziegler, pp. 189, 192.</ref> He was persuaded otherwise by traditionalists. He refused, however, to celebrate the coronation in the expensive way his brother had\u2014the 1821 coronation had cost \u00a3240,000, of which \u00a316,000 was merely to hire the jewels. At William's instructions, the Privy Council budgeted less than \u00a330,000 for the coronation.<ref>Molloy, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> When traditionalist Tories threatened to boycott what they called the \"[[Half crown (British coin)|Half Crown]]-nation\",<ref>Allen, p. 130 and Ziegler, p. 193.</ref> the King retorted that they should go ahead, and that he anticipated \"greater convenience of room and less heat\".<ref>[[Sir Herbert Taylor]], the King's secretary, writing to Lord Grey, 15 August 1831, quoted in Ziegler, p. 194.</ref>\n\nAfter the rejection of the Second Reform Bill by the House of Lords in October 1831, agitation for reform grew across the country; demonstrations grew violent in so-called \"Reform Riots\". In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the Lords, and re-introduced the Bill, which still faced difficulties in the Lords. Frustrated by the Lords' recalcitrance, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected\u2014though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours.<ref>Allen, p. 132.</ref> William reluctantly agreed to the creation of the number of peers sufficient \"to secure the success of the bill\".<ref>Correspondence of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]], with William IV and Sir Herbert Taylor, edited by [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey]], (1867) 2.102, 113, quoted in Brock</ref> However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the [[peerage]], told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and collateral heirs of existing peers, so that the created peerages would eventually be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety.<ref>Allen, pp. 137\u2013141; Ziegler, pp. 196\u2013212.</ref> The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King's popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill's opponents abstained and the [[Reform Act 1832]] was passed. The mob blamed William's actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 214\u2013222.</ref>\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nWilliam distrusted foreigners, particularly anyone French,<ref>Allen, p. 205; Ziegler, p. 223.</ref> which he acknowledged as a \"prejudice\".<ref>Sir Herbert Taylor writing to Lord Grey, 1 May 1832, quoted in Ziegler, p. 224.</ref> He also felt strongly that Britain should not interfere in the internal affairs of other nations, which brought him into conflict with the interventionist [[Foreign Secretary (United Kingdom)|Foreign Secretary]], [[Lord Palmerston]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 225.</ref> William supported [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian independence]] and, after unacceptable [[William II of the Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|French candidates]] were put forward, favoured [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], the widower of his niece, Charlotte, as a candidate for the newly created Belgian throne.<ref>Ziegler, p. 227.</ref>\n\nThough he had a reputation for tactlessness and buffoonery, William could be shrewd and diplomatic. He foresaw that the potential construction of a [[Suez Canal|canal at Suez]] would make good relations with [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] vital to Britain.<ref>William writing to Palmerston, 1 June 1833, quoted in Ziegler, p. 234.</ref> Later in his reign, he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being \"born a free, independent American, so much did he respect that nation, which had given birth to George Washington, the greatest man that ever lived\".<ref>Ziegler, p. 292.</ref> By exercising his personal charm, William assisted in the repair of Anglo-American relations, which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father.<ref>Allen, p. 229.</ref>\n\n=== King of Hanover ===\nPublic perception in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. This was not the case. In 1832, [[Metternich]] introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William's influence to cause the Hanoverian government to take the same position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston's dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states, to be held in [[Vienna]], and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, William's brother [[Prince Adolphus]], Viceroy of Hanover, accepted, backed fully by William.<ref>Ziegler, p. 230f.</ref> In 1833, William signed a new constitution for Hanover, which empowered the middle class, gave limited power to the lower classes, and expanded the role of the parliament. The constitution was revoked after William's death by his brother, [[King Ernest Augustus]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hanover and G\u00f6ttingen, 1837|first=James M. |last=Brophy |journal=Victorian Review |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=2010 |pages=9\u201314 |jstor=41039097}}</ref>\n\n=== Later reign and death ===\n[[File:King William IV by Sir David Wilkie.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], 1837]]\nFor the remainder of his reign, William interfered actively in politics only once, in 1834, when he became the last British sovereign to choose a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. In 1834, the ministry was facing increasing unpopularity and Lord Grey retired; the [[Home Secretary]], [[Lord Melbourne]], replaced him. Melbourne retained most Cabinet members, and his ministry retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Some members of the Government, however, were anathema to the King, and increasingly left-wing policies concerned him. The previous year Grey had already pushed through a bill reforming the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]]. The Church collected [[tithe]]s throughout Ireland, supported multiple bishoprics and was wealthy. However, barely an eighth of the Irish population belonged to the Church of Ireland. In some parishes, there were no Church of Ireland members at all, but there was still a priest paid for by tithes collected from the local Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], leading to charges that idle priests were living in luxury at the expense of the Irish living at the level of subsistence. Grey's bill had reduced the number of bishoprics by half, abolished some of the sinecures and overhauled the tithe system. Further measures to appropriate the surplus revenues of the Church of Ireland were mooted by the more radical members of the Government, including [[Lord John Russell]].<ref>Ziegler, pp. 242\u2013255.</ref> The King had an especial dislike for Russell, calling him \"a dangerous little Radical.\"<ref>Molloy, p. 326.</ref>\n\n[[File:William4coin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half-Crown]] of William IV, 1836. The inscription reads GULIELMUS IIII D(EI) G(RATIA) BRITANNIAR(UM) REX [[Fidei defensor|F(IDEI) D(EFENSOR)]] (William IV by the Grace of God King of the Britains, [[Fidei defensor#Modern usage|Defender of the Faith)]]]]\nIn November 1834, the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Lord Althorp]], inherited a peerage, thus removing him from the Commons to the Lords. Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must be drawn from the Commons), but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell, whom William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics. William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp\u2014who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer<ref>Somerset, p. 187.</ref>\u2014as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry. With Lord Melbourne gone, William chose to entrust power to a Tory, [[Sir Robert Peel]]. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed Prime Minister.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 256\u2013257.</ref> When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of Commons. Consequently, Parliament was dissolved to force [[1835 United Kingdom general election|fresh elections]]. Although the Tories won more seats than in the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|previous election]], they were still in the minority. Peel remained in office for a few months, but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Melbourne was restored to the Prime Minister's office, remaining there for the rest of William's reign, and the King was forced to accept Russell as Commons leader.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 261\u2013267.</ref>\n\nThe King had a mixed relationship with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, such as the devolution of powers to the [[Legislative Council of Lower Canada]], which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead to the loss of the colony.<ref>Ziegler, p. 274.</ref> At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to [[Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford|Lord Gosford]], Governor General-designate of Canada: \"Mind what you are about in Canada&nbsp;... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 202.</ref> When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during [[Royal Ascot#Royal Ascot|Ascot week]], William gloomily replied, \"I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house.\"<ref name=Somerset200>Somerset, p. 200.</ref> Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform.<ref>Allen, pp. 221\u2013222.</ref> Despite his disagreements with Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady [[Caroline Norton]]\u2014he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought.<ref>Somerset, p. 204.</ref> The King and Prime Minister eventually found a ''modus vivendi''; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.<ref name=Somerset200/>\n\nBoth the King and Queen were fond of their niece, [[Princess Victoria of Kent]]. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], the Princess's widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess, William expressed his hope that he would survive until the Princess was 18 so that the Duchess would never be regent. He said, \"I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer&nbsp;... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 209.</ref> The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as \"a good old man, though eccentric and singular\".<ref>Allen, p. 225.</ref> William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. \"Poor old man!\", Victoria wrote as he was dying, \"I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me.\"<ref>Victoria writing to Leopold, 19 June 1837, quoted in Ziegler, p. 290.</ref>\n\n[[File:William IV in 1837 by his daughter Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William IV drawn by his daughter [[Sophia Sidney, Baroness De L'Isle and Dudley|Sophia de L'Isle and Dudley]] in early 1837]]\nWilliam was \"very much shaken and affected\" by the death of his eldest daughter, [[Sophia Sidney, Baroness De L'Isle and Dudley|Sophia, Lady de L'Isle and Dudley]], in childbirth in April 1837.<ref>Sir Herbert Taylor quoted in Ziegler, p. 287.</ref> William and his eldest son, [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|George, Earl of Munster]], were estranged at the time, but William hoped that a letter of condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation. His hopes were not fulfilled and Munster, still thinking he had not been given sufficient money or patronage, remained bitter to the end.<ref>Ziegler, p. 287.</ref>\n\nQueen Adelaide attended the dying William devotedly, not going to bed herself for more than ten days.<ref>Ziegler, p. 289.</ref> William died in the early hours of the morning of 20 June 1837 at [[Windsor Castle]], where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria, the only child of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|the Duke of Kent]], George III's fourth son. Under [[Salic Law]], a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, the Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the [[personal union]] of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted  since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> Although William is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]],<ref>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Price | title = Cameron's royal link makes him a true blue | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article745903.ece | date = 5 December 2005 | work = The Times | location = UK | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090514021758/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article745903.ece | archivedate = 14 May 2009}}</ref> TV presenter [[Adam Hart-Davis]], and author and statesman [[Duff Cooper]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Family detective: Adam Hart-Davis | date = 5 January 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355487/Family-detective-Adam-Hart-Davis.html | work = The Daily Telegraph | location = UK | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | first = Nick | last = Barratt }}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:King William IV. monument G\u00f6ttingen.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of William IV in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany. The [[Latin]] inscription reads: \"William the Fourth, King, Father of the Fatherland\".]]\nWilliam IV had a short but eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated a reduction in the political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence over the electorate. During the reign of George III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the electorate to vote in favour of the new administration. Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the [[Fox-North Coalition]], and in 1807, after the dismissal of [[Lord Grenville]]. But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the electorate, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, \"I have my view of things, and I tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty.\"<ref>''Recollections'' of [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]], quoted in Ziegler, p. 276.</ref>\n\nDuring William's reign the British Parliament enacted major reforms, including the [[Factory Act of 1833]] (preventing child labour), the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] (emancipating slaves in the colonies), and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] (standardising provision for the destitute).<ref name=\"ma\"/> William attracted criticism both from reformers, who felt that reform did not go far enough, and from reactionaries, who felt that reform went too far. A modern interpretation sees him as failing to satisfy either political extreme by trying to find compromise between two bitterly opposed factions, but in the process proving himself more capable as a constitutional monarch than many had supposed.<ref>\n{{cite encyclopedia\n| last = Fulford | first = Roger\n| title = William IV\n| encyclopedia = Collier's Encyclopedia\n| year = 1967\n| page = 493 |volume= 23\n}}\n</ref><ref>Ziegler, pp. 291\u2013294.</ref>\n\n== Titles, styles, honours, and arms ==\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n* 21 August 1765&nbsp;\u2013 16 May 1789: ''[[His Royal Highness]]'' The Prince William Henry\n* 16 May 1789&nbsp;\u2013 26 June 1830: ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Clarence and St Andrews\n* 26 June 1830&nbsp;\u2013 20 June 1837: ''[[Majesty|His Majesty]]'' The King of the United Kingdom and Hanover\n\n=== Honours ===\n'''British and Hanoverian honours'''<ref name=cokayne>[[George Cokayne|Cokayne, G.E.]]; [[Vicary Gibbs (St Albans MP)|Gibbs, Vicary]]; Doubleday, H.

The third son of [[George III]], William succeeded his elder brother [[George IV]], becoming the last king and penultimate monarch of Britain's [[House of Hanover]].\n\nWilliam served in the [[Royal Navy]] in his youth, spending time in North America and the [[Caribbean]], and was later nicknamed the \"Sailor King\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Scots Greys | last = Staff writer | date = 25 January 1831 |work=The Times | location = UK | page = 3 | quote = ...they will have the additional honour of attending our \"Sailor King\"... }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Will of his late Majesty William IV | last = Staff writer | date = 29 June 1837 |work=The Times | location = UK | page = 5 | quote = ...ever since the accession of our sailor King... }}</ref> In 1789, he was created [[Duke of Clarence and St Andrews]]. In 1827, he was appointed as Britain's first [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom|Lord High Admiral]] since 1709. As his two older brothers died without leaving legitimate issue, he [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited the throne]] when he was 64 years old. His reign saw several reforms: the [[poor law]] was updated, [[child labour]] restricted, [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|slavery abolished]] in nearly all of the [[British Empire]], and the British electoral system refashioned by the [[Reform Act 1832]]. Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father, he was the last monarch to appoint a British prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution.\n\nAt the time of his death, William had no surviving legitimate children, but he was survived by eight of the ten illegitimate children he had by the actress [[Dorothea Jordan]], with whom he cohabited for twenty years. Late in life, he married and apparently remained faithful to the young princess who would become [[Queen Adelaide]].

Freedom would do the slaves little good, he argued. He had travelled widely and, in his eyes, the living standard among freemen in the [[Highlands and Islands]] of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the [[West Indies]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 54.</ref> His experience in the Caribbean, where he \"quickly absorbed the plantation owners' views about slavery\",<ref>Hochschild, p. 186.</ref> lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 97\u201399.</ref> In his first speech before Parliament he called himself \"an attentive observer of the state of the negroes\" who found them well cared for and \"in a state of humble happiness\".<ref>Hochschild, p. 187.</ref> Others thought it \"shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade\".<ref>[[Zachary Macaulay]] writing to Miss Mills, 1 June 1799, quoted in Ziegler, p. 98.</ref> In his speech to the House, William insulted [[William Wilberforce]], the leading abolitionist, saying: \"the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce\".<ref>Fulford, p. 121.</ref> On other issues he was more liberal, such as supporting moves to abolish [[Penal law (Britain)|penal laws]] against [[English Dissenters|dissenting Christians]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 99.</ref> He also opposed efforts to bar those found guilty of [[adultery]] from remarriage.<ref>Fulford, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n== Relationships and marriage ==\nFrom 1791 William lived with an Irish actress, [[Dorothea Bland]], better known by her stage name, Mrs. Jordan,<ref name=\"rh\" /> the title \"Mrs.\" being assumed at the start of her stage career to explain an inconvenient pregnancy<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 51.</ref> and \"Jordan\" because she had \"crossed the water\" from Ireland to Britain.<ref>Allen, p. 49 and Ziegler, p. 76.</ref> He appeared to enjoy the domesticity of his life with Mrs. Jordan, remarking to a friend: \"Mrs. Jordan is a very good creature, very domestic and careful of her children.

In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second in the line of succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate relatively frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was [[barley water]] flavoured with lemon.<ref>Ziegler, p. 130.</ref> Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered only a matter of time before he became king.<ref>Molloy, p. 9.</ref> When Frederick died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, [[George Canning]], appointed him to the office of [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom|Lord High Admiral]], which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of [[Admiralty]] officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remaining away for ten days. The King requested his resignation through the Prime Minister, the [[Duke of Wellington]]; he complied.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\nDespite the difficulties William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the [[cat o' nine tails]] for most offences other than [[mutiny]], attempted to improve the standard of naval gunnery, and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more.<ref>Ziegler, p. 141.</ref> Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them\u2014a process that might have been far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming king that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>Ziegler, p. 133.</ref>\n\nWilliam spent the remaining time during his brother's reign in the House of Lords. He supported the [[Catholic Emancipation]] Bill against the opposition of his younger brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], describing the latter's position on the Bill as \"infamous\", to Cumberland's outrage.<ref name=Ziegler143>Ziegler, p. 143.</ref> George IV's health was increasingly bad; it was obvious by early 1830 that he was near death. The King took his leave of his younger brother at the end of May, stating, \"God's will be done. I have injured no man. It will all rest on you then.\"<ref>Fulford, p. 137.</ref> William's genuine affection for his older brother could not mask his rising anticipation that he would soon be king.<ref name=Ziegler143/><ref>Allen, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early reign ===\n[[File:WilliamIVbyLonsdale.jpg|thumb|William IV in Masonic insignia. Portrait by [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]], 1830]]\nWhen King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without surviving legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was the oldest person yet to assume the British throne.<ref>Ashley, p. 3.</ref> Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended to spend most of his time in [[Windsor Castle]], William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or [[Brighton]]. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the people, who saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.<ref>Allen, pp. 83\u201386; Ziegler, pp. 150\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe King immediately proved himself a conscientious worker. The Prime Minister, Wellington, stated that he had done more business with King William in ten minutes than he had with George IV in as many days.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 179.</ref> [[Lord Brougham]] described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter\u2014whereas George IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.<ref>Somerset, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe King did his best to endear himself to the people. [[Charlotte Williams-Wynn (diarist)|Charlotte Williams-Wynn]] wrote shortly after his accession: \"Hitherto the King has been indefatigable in his efforts to make himself popular, and do good natured and amiable things in every possible instance.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 110.</ref> [[Emily Eden]] noted: \"He is an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal, who died growling sulkily in his den at Windsor. This man at least ''wishes'' to make everybody happy, and everything he has done has been benevolent.\"<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 178.</ref>\n\nWilliam dismissed his brother's French chefs and German band, replacing them with English ones to public approval. He gave much of George IV's art collection to the nation, and halved the royal [[Stud (animal)|stud]]. George had begun an extensive (and expensive) renovation of [[Buckingham Palace]]; William refused to reside there, and twice tried to give the palace away, once to the Army as a barracks, and once to Parliament after the [[Houses of Parliament]] burned down in 1834.<ref>Somerset, p. 110\u2013122.</ref> His informality could be startling: When in residence at the [[Royal Pavilion]] in Brighton, King William used to send to the hotels for a list of their guests and invite anyone he knew to dinner, urging guests not to \"bother about clothes. The Queen does nothing but embroider flowers after dinner.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 119f.</ref>\n\nUpon taking the throne, William did not forget his nine surviving illegitimate children, creating his eldest son [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|Earl of Munster]] and granting the other children the precedence of a daughter or a younger son of a marquess. Despite this, his children importuned for greater opportunities, disgusting elements of the press who reported that the \"impudence and rapacity of the FitzJordans is unexampled\".<ref>''Morning Post'' quoted in Ziegler, p. 158.</ref> The relationship between William and his sons \"was punctuated by a series of savage and, for the King at least, painful quarrels\" over money and honours.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 158\u2013159.</ref> His daughters, on the other hand, proved an ornament to his court, as, \"They are all, you know, pretty and lively, and make society in a way that real princesses could not.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 117.</ref>\n\n=== Reform crisis ===\nAt the time, the [[Demise of the Crown|death of the monarch]] required fresh elections and, in the [[1830 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1830]], Wellington's [[Tories]] lost ground to the Whigs under [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]] elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as [[rotten borough|rotten]] or [[pocket borough]]s\u2014such as [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] with just seven voters\u2014elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents\u2014who were, most often, their tenants\u2014especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 177\u2013180.</ref>\n[[File:Reformact1832cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|Political cartoon supporting the Reform Act: King William sits above the clouds, surrounded by Whig politicians; below [[Britannia]] and the British Lion cause the Tories to flee.]]\n\nWhen the House of Commons defeated the First Reform Bill in 1831, Grey's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which would lead to a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country was in a state of high excitement which might boil over into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, the King prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 182\u2013188.</ref> The monarch's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address.<ref name=Ziegler188>Ziegler, p. 188.</ref> When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, \"Then I will go in a [[hackney cab]]!\"<ref name=Ziegler188/> Coach and horses were assembled quickly and he immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said ''The Times'' of the scene before William's arrival, \"It is utterly impossible to describe the scene&nbsp;... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords&nbsp;... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm.\"<ref>Grant, p. 59, quoting ''The Times''</ref> [[Charles Stewart, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry|Lord Londonderry]] brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament.<ref>Allen, pp. 121\u2013122 and Ziegler, p. 189.</ref> This forced [[1831 United Kingdom general election|new elections for the House of Commons]], which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the Lords remained implacably opposed to it.<ref>Allen, pp. 124\u2013127; Ziegler, p. 190f.</ref>\n\nThe crisis saw a brief interlude for the celebration of the [[Coronation of the British monarch|King's Coronation]] on 8 September 1831. At first, William wished to dispense with the coronation entirely, feeling that his wearing the crown while proroguing Parliament answered any need.<ref>Allen, pp. 124, 130; Ziegler, pp. 189, 192.</ref> He was persuaded otherwise by traditionalists. He refused, however, to celebrate the coronation in the expensive way his brother had\u2014the 1821 coronation had cost \u00a3240,000, of which \u00a316,000 was merely to hire the jewels. At William's instructions, the Privy Council budgeted less than \u00a330,000 for the coronation.<ref>Molloy, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> When traditionalist Tories threatened to boycott what they called the \"[[Half crown (British coin)|Half Crown]]-nation\",<ref>Allen, p. 130 and Ziegler, p. 193.</ref> the King retorted that they should go ahead, and that he anticipated \"greater convenience of room and less heat\".<ref>[[Sir Herbert Taylor]], the King's secretary, writing to Lord Grey, 15 August 1831, quoted in Ziegler, p. 194.</ref>\n\nAfter the rejection of the Second Reform Bill by the House of Lords in October 1831, agitation for reform grew across the country; demonstrations grew violent in so-called \"Reform Riots\". In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the Lords, and re-introduced the Bill, which still faced difficulties in the Lords. Frustrated by the Lords' recalcitrance, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected\u2014though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours.<ref>Allen, p. 132.</ref> William reluctantly agreed to the creation of the number of peers sufficient \"to secure the success of the bill\".<ref>Correspondence of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]], with William IV and Sir Herbert Taylor, edited by [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey]], (1867) 2.102, 113, quoted in Brock</ref> However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the [[peerage]], told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and collateral heirs of existing peers, so that the created peerages would eventually be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety.<ref>Allen, pp. 137\u2013141; Ziegler, pp. 196\u2013212.</ref> The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King's popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill's opponents abstained and the [[Reform Act 1832]] was passed. The mob blamed William's actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 214\u2013222.</ref>\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nWilliam distrusted foreigners, particularly anyone French,<ref>Allen, p. 205; Ziegler, p. 223.</ref> which he acknowledged as a \"prejudice\".<ref>Sir Herbert Taylor writing to Lord Grey, 1 May 1832, quoted in Ziegler, p. 224.</ref> He also felt strongly that Britain should not interfere in the internal affairs of other nations, which brought him into conflict with the interventionist [[Foreign Secretary (United Kingdom)|Foreign Secretary]], [[Lord Palmerston]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 225.</ref> William supported [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian independence]] and, after unacceptable [[William II of the Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|French candidates]] were put forward, favoured [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], the widower of his niece, Charlotte, as a candidate for the newly created Belgian throne.<ref>Ziegler, p. 227.</ref>\n\nThough he had a reputation for tactlessness and buffoonery, William could be shrewd and diplomatic. He foresaw that the potential construction of a [[Suez Canal|canal at Suez]] would make good relations with [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] vital to Britain.<ref>William writing to Palmerston, 1 June 1833, quoted in Ziegler, p. 234.</ref> Later in his reign, he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being \"born a free, independent American, so much did he respect that nation, which had given birth to George Washington, the greatest man that ever lived\".<ref>Ziegler, p. 292.</ref> By exercising his personal charm, William assisted in the repair of Anglo-American relations, which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father.<ref>Allen, p. 229.</ref>\n\n=== King of Hanover ===\nPublic perception in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. This was not the case. In 1832, [[Metternich]] introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William's influence to cause the Hanoverian government to take the same position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston's dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states, to be held in [[Vienna]], and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, William's brother [[Prince Adolphus]], Viceroy of Hanover, accepted, backed fully by William.<ref>Ziegler, p. 230f.</ref> In 1833, William signed a new constitution for Hanover, which empowered the middle class, gave limited power to the lower classes, and expanded the role of the parliament. The constitution was revoked after William's death by his brother, [[King Ernest Augustus]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hanover and G\u00f6ttingen, 1837|first=James M. |last=Brophy |journal=Victorian Review |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=2010 |pages=9\u201314 |jstor=41039097}}</ref>\n\n=== Later reign and death ===\n[[File:King William IV by Sir David Wilkie.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], 1837]]\nFor the remainder of his reign, William interfered actively in politics only once, in 1834, when he became the last British sovereign to choose a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. In 1834, the ministry was facing increasing unpopularity and Lord Grey retired; the [[Home Secretary]], [[Lord Melbourne]], replaced him. Melbourne retained most Cabinet members, and his ministry retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Some members of the Government, however, were anathema to the King, and increasingly left-wing policies concerned him. The previous year Grey had already pushed through a bill reforming the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]]. The Church collected [[tithe]]s throughout Ireland, supported multiple bishoprics and was wealthy. However, barely an eighth of the Irish population belonged to the Church of Ireland. In some parishes, there were no Church of Ireland members at all, but there was still a priest paid for by tithes collected from the local Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], leading to charges that idle priests were living in luxury at the expense of the Irish living at the level of subsistence. Grey's bill had reduced the number of bishoprics by half, abolished some of the sinecures and overhauled the tithe system. Further measures to appropriate the surplus revenues of the Church of Ireland were mooted by the more radical members of the Government, including [[Lord John Russell]].<ref>Ziegler, pp. 242\u2013255.</ref> The King had an especial dislike for Russell, calling him \"a dangerous little Radical.\"<ref>Molloy, p. 326.</ref>\n\n[[File:William4coin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half-Crown]] of William IV, 1836. The inscription reads GULIELMUS IIII D(EI) G(RATIA) BRITANNIAR(UM) REX [[Fidei defensor|F(IDEI) D(EFENSOR)]] (William IV by the Grace of God King of the Britains, [[Fidei defensor#Modern usage|Defender of the Faith)]]]]\nIn November 1834, the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Lord Althorp]], inherited a peerage, thus removing him from the Commons to the Lords. Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must be drawn from the Commons), but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell, whom William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics. William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp\u2014who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer<ref>Somerset, p. 187.</ref>\u2014as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry. With Lord Melbourne gone, William chose to entrust power to a Tory, [[Sir Robert Peel]]. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed Prime Minister.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 256\u2013257.</ref> When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of Commons. Consequently, Parliament was dissolved to force [[1835 United Kingdom general election|fresh elections]]. Although the Tories won more seats than in the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|previous election]], they were still in the minority. Peel remained in office for a few months, but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Melbourne was restored to the Prime Minister's office, remaining there for the rest of William's reign, and the King was forced to accept Russell as Commons leader.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 261\u2013267.</ref>\n\nThe King had a mixed relationship with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, such as the devolution of powers to the [[Legislative Council of Lower Canada]], which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead to the loss of the colony.<ref>Ziegler, p. 274.</ref> At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to [[Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford|Lord Gosford]], Governor General-designate of Canada: \"Mind what you are about in Canada&nbsp;... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 202.</ref> When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during [[Royal Ascot#Royal Ascot|Ascot week]], William gloomily replied, \"I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house.\"<ref name=Somerset200>Somerset, p. 200.</ref> Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform.<ref>Allen, pp. 221\u2013222.</ref> Despite his disagreements with Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady [[Caroline Norton]]\u2014he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought.<ref>Somerset, p. 204.</ref> The King and Prime Minister eventually found a ''modus vivendi''; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.<ref name=Somerset200/>\n\nBoth the King and Queen were fond of their niece, [[Princess Victoria of Kent]]. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], the Princess's widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess, William expressed his hope that he would survive until the Princess was 18 so that the Duchess would never be regent. He said, \"I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer&nbsp;... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.\"<ref>Somerset, p. 209.</ref> The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as \"a good old man, though eccentric and singular\".<ref>Allen, p. 225.</ref> William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. \"Poor old man!\", Victoria wrote as he was dying, \"I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me.\"<ref>Victoria writing to Leopold, 19 June 1837, quoted in Ziegler, p. 290.</ref>\n\n[[File:William IV in 1837 by his daughter Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William IV drawn by his daughter [[Sophia Sidney, Baroness De L'Isle and Dudley|Sophia de L'Isle and Dudley]] in early 1837]]\nWilliam was \"very much shaken and affected\" by the death of his eldest daughter, [[Sophia Sidney, Baroness De L'Isle and Dudley|Sophia, Lady de L'Isle and Dudley]], in childbirth in April 1837.<ref>Sir Herbert Taylor quoted in Ziegler, p. 287.</ref> William and his eldest son, [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|George, Earl of Munster]], were estranged at the time, but William hoped that a letter of condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation. His hopes were not fulfilled and Munster, still thinking he had not been given sufficient money or patronage, remained bitter to the end.<ref>Ziegler, p. 287.</ref>\n\nQueen Adelaide attended the dying William devotedly, not going to bed herself for more than ten days.<ref>Ziegler, p. 289.</ref> William died in the early hours of the morning of 20 June 1837 at [[Windsor Castle]], where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria, the only child of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|the Duke of Kent]], George III's fourth son. Under [[Salic Law]], a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, the Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the [[personal union]] of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted  since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> Although William is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]],<ref>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Price | title = Cameron's royal link makes him a true blue | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article745903.ece | date = 5 December 2005 | work = The Times | location = UK | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090514021758/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article745903.ece | archivedate = 14 May 2009}}</ref> TV presenter [[Adam Hart-Davis]], and author and statesman [[Duff Cooper]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Family detective: Adam Hart-Davis | date = 5 January 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355487/Family-detective-Adam-Hart-Davis.html | work = The Daily Telegraph | location = UK | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | first = Nick | last = Barratt }}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:King William IV. monument G\u00f6ttingen.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of William IV in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany. The [[Latin]] inscription reads: \"William the Fourth, King, Father of the Fatherland\".]]\nWilliam IV had a short but eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated a reduction in the political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence over the electorate. During the reign of George III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the electorate to vote in favour of the new administration. Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the [[Fox-North Coalition]], and in 1807, after the dismissal of [[Lord Grenville]]. But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the electorate, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, \"I have my view of things, and I tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty.\"<ref>''Recollections'' of [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]], quoted in Ziegler, p. 276.</ref>\n\nDuring William's reign the British Parliament enacted major reforms, including the [[Factory Act of 1833]] (preventing child labour), the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] (emancipating slaves in the colonies), and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] (standardising provision for the destitute).<ref name=\"ma\"/> William attracted criticism both from reformers, who felt that reform did not go far enough, and from reactionaries, who felt that reform went too far. A modern interpretation sees him as failing to satisfy either political extreme by trying to find compromise between two bitterly opposed factions, but in the process proving himself more capable as a constitutional monarch than many had supposed.<ref>\n{{cite encyclopedia\n| last = Fulford | first = Roger\n| title = William IV\n| encyclopedia = Collier's Encyclopedia\n| year = 1967\n| page = 493 |volume= 23\n}}\n</ref><ref>Ziegler, pp. 291\u2013294.</ref>\n\n== Titles, styles, honours, and arms ==\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n* 21 August 1765&nbsp;\u2013 16 May 1789: ''[[His Royal Highness]]'' The Prince William Henry\n* 16 May 1789&nbsp;\u2013 26 June 1830: ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Clarence and St Andrews\n* 26 June 1830&nbsp;\u2013 20 June 1837: ''[[Majesty|His Majesty]]'' The King of the United Kingdom and Hanover\n\n=== Honours ===\n'''British and Hanoverian honours'''<ref name=cokayne>[[George Cokayne|Cokayne, G.E.]]; [[Vicary Gibbs (St Albans MP)|Gibbs, Vicary]]; Doubleday, H.

The show was hosted by [[Mark L. Walberg]] and announced by [[Burton Richardson (television announcer)|Burton Richardson]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe ''Russian Roulette'' set consists of a circle with six trapdoors (referred to as \"drop zones\" by the host), four of which are occupied by the episode's contestants.\n\n===First round===\nThe four contestants are each given $150 at the beginning of the episode, and questions for the first round are valued on that same amount.\n\nThe number of red lights on the field indicates the number of active drop zones, starting with one drop, and another drop zone is added for each succeeding question (up to five drops starting at question five) and increasing the odds that the contestant will be eliminated after providing an incorrect answer.\n\nOne contestant is shown a question and must challenge an opponent to answer it. The challenged contestant is then shown three possible answers and has 10 seconds to choose the right answer. A correct answer awards the contestant $150 and becomes the challenger for the next question; otherwise, the contestant forfeits their money to the challenger and must play Russian Roulette by pulling the handle in front of them to rotate the drop zones in play around the six trapdoors. If a drop zone lands on that contestant's spot, the trapdoor opens and they drop through the floor and are eliminated from the game. Otherwise, the contestant remains in the game and becomes the challenger for the next question.\n\nThe round ends when a contestant drops and is eliminated. If time expires before this happens, one contestant is eliminated at random via one final handle pull at the center of the stage. The contestant with the highest score is granted immunity from the drop by coming to the center of the stage to pull the handle; if there is a tie for the lead, the host pulls the lever, with all four contestants in danger of elimination. The eliminated contestant's money (if any) is distributed evenly among the remaining three contestants.\n\n===Second and third rounds===\nThe second round is played similarly to the first, with the three remaining contestants answering questions valued at $200 each, and questions now having four possible answers. In round three, the two remaining contestants face off with questions valued at $300 (season 1) or $250 (season 2). Play is similar to rounds one and two, except that the contestant who first hears the question may elect to answer it themselves or challenge their opponent. After round three, the last contestant standing keeps all their money and goes to the bonus round, while the runner-up drops automatically. If there is a tie at the end of round three, one final random Russian Roulette spin is played to determine the winner.\n\n==Bonus round==\nThe winning contestant is moved to the top-left zone and has 60 seconds to answer five \"brain-teaser\" questions correctly (ten multiple-choice questions of three answers in Season two). These usually consist of anagrams and jumbled words (unscrambling letters to form the answer based on clues given), math problems and general-knowledge questions. The timer begins ticking while the host asks the first question. After every ten seconds, one drop zone opens on the play field. If time runs out or the contestant at any time gives an incorrect answer, he or she drops, but receives $500 ($300 in season two) for every correct answer. The contestant has the option to pass on a question and return to it if time permits. In season one, the contestant is required to begin with the phrase \"My answer is...\" before their answer so that thinking aloud is not mistaken for an answer, but it is no longer required on Season two. \n\nFor answering all the questions correctly, the contestant's winnings for this round is augmented to $10,000; the contestant is given an option to risk $10,000 (winnings prior to the bonus round are not affected) for one final game of Russian Roulette for a grand prize of $100,000, with the number of drop zones opening during the previous segment used as the number of drop zones for the final game.\n\nAt the end of the show's run, three contestants (two in Season 1 and one in Season 2) had survived the final drop and won the $100,000 grand prize.\n\n==International versions==\nOn all versions of ''Russian Roulette'' outside of the U.S., U.K., Argentina, Portugal, and Poland (in season two), there are also displays of the contestants' heart rates on the screen (examples include Russia's, Poland's (season one), and Hong Kong's versions), and most versions even have the contestants themselves asking questions to their opponents. There is also a camera underneath each of the trapdoors to catch footage of the contestant dropping from another angle. Some may also have a maximum time limit of 15 seconds instead of 10 to answer questions. The Polish version has 30 seconds to answer the question in season one and 20 seconds in season two. Most versions of the show (except for the versions in the U.S., Greece, Taiwan and India) run for an hour rather than a half-hour. As of 2013, there are no versions of the show still in production internationally. However, China's religional broadcaster Shandong TV revived the show in Spring 2015 in substitution of the previous edition using the format of ''[[The Million Pound Drop]]'', this version using a format that a little different to other ones \u2013 and the daily prize fund always starts at [[Renminbi|RMB\u00a5]]50,000, and each correct answer before the final round earns RMB\u00a51,000 to the final pot. The Chinese version is broadcast live on weekdays, and runs for 65 minutes (including commercials).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Country !! Name !!

The show was hosted by [[Mark L. Walberg]] and announced by [[Burton Richardson (television announcer)|Burton Richardson]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe ''Russian Roulette'' set consists of a circle with six trapdoors (referred to as \"drop zones\" by the host), four of which are occupied by the episode's contestants.\n\n===First round===\nThe four contestants are each given $150 at the beginning of the episode, and questions in the first round are all worth that same amount.\n\nThe number of red lights on the field indicates the number of active drop zones. At the start of the round there is only one drop zone active. After each additional question, another drop zone is added, increasing the odds that the contestant will be eliminated after providing an incorrect answer. From the fifth question onward, there are always five drop zones.\n\nOne contestant is shown a question and must challenge an opponent to answer it. The challenged contestant is then shown three possible answers and has 10 seconds to choose the right answer. If they are correct, that contestant wins $150 and becomes the challenger for the next question. If they guess incorrectly, they lose all their money to the challenger and must play Russian Roulette by pulling the handle in front of them to rotate the drop zones in play around the six trapdoors. If a drop zone lands on that contestant's spot, the trapdoor opens and they drop through the floor and are eliminated from the game. Otherwise, the contestant remains in the game and becomes the challenger for the next question.\n\nThe round ends when a contestant drops and is eliminated. If time expires before this happens, one contestant is eliminated at random via one final handle pull at the center of the stage. The contestant with the highest score is granted immunity from the drop by coming to the center of the stage to pull the handle. If there is a tie for the lead, the host pulls the lever, with all four contestants in danger of elimination. The eliminated contestant's money (if any) is distributed evenly among the remaining three contestants.\n\n===Second and third rounds===\nThe second round is played similarly to the first, with the three remaining contestants answering questions valued at $200 each, and questions now having four possible answers. In round three, the two remaining contestants face off with questions valued at $300 (season 1) or $250 (season 2). Play is similar to rounds one and two, except that the contestant who first hears the question may elect to answer it themselves or challenge their opponent. At the conclusion of round three, the remaining contestant keeps all their money and goes to the bonus round, while the runner up drops automatically. If there is a tie at the end of round three, one final random Russian Roulette spin is played to determine the winner.\n\n==Bonus round==\n\n===First season===\nThe winning contestant is moved to the top-left zone and has 60 seconds to answer five \"brain-teaser\" questions correctly. These usually consist of anagrams and jumbled words (unscrambling letters to form the answer based on clues given), math problems and general-knowledge questions. The timer begins ticking while the host asks the first question. After every ten seconds, one drop zone opens on the play field. If time runs out or the contestant at any time gives an incorrect answer, he or she drops, but receives $500 for every correct answer. The contestant has the option to pass on a question and return to it if time allows. Also, the contestant must say \"My answer is...\" before their answer so that thinking aloud is not mistaken for an answer. The contestant wins $10,000 for answering all five questions correctly.\n\nThe contestant can keep the $10,000 or return it and play one final game of Russian Roulette, with the number of drop zones opening during the previous segment used as the number of drop zones for the final game. If they survive, the contestant wins $100,000; however, the contestant keeps his or her front game winnings regardless of the outcome.\n\n===Second season===\n\nThe endgame is similar to the first version, except the contestant must answer 10 multiple-choice questions (each with three choices) correctly in 60 seconds in order to win $10,000. The timer only starts ticking after the first question has been read by the host. If the contestant fails, he/she drops and receives an additional $300 for every correct answer given. Saying \"My answer is\" before the answer is no longer required. The contestant wins $10,000 for answering all ten questions correctly and has the opportunity to risk it to win $100,000, using the same process as in the first season.\n\n==International versions==\nOn all versions of ''Russian Roulette'' outside of the U.S., U.K., Argentina, Portugal, and Poland (in season two), there are also displays of the contestants' heart rates on the screen (examples include Russia's, Poland's (season one), and Hong Kong's versions), and most versions even have the contestants themselves asking questions to their opponents. There is also a camera underneath each of the trapdoors to catch footage of the contestant dropping from another angle. Some may also have a maximum time limit of 15 seconds instead of 10 to answer questions. The Polish version has 30 seconds to answer the question in season one and 20 seconds in season two. Most versions of the show (except for the versions in the U.S., Greece, Taiwan and India) run for an hour rather than a half-hour. As of 2013, there are no versions of the show still in production internationally. However, China's religional broadcaster Shandong TV revived the show in Spring 2015 in substitution of the previous edition using the format of ''[[The Million Pound Drop]]'', this version using a format that a little different to other ones \u2013 and the daily prize fund always starts at [[Renminbi|RMB\u00a5]]50,000, and each correct answer before the final round earns RMB\u00a51,000 to the final pot.

An entry in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series, it follows [[Mario]] and Cappy, a sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save [[Princess Peach]] from his nemesis [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.{{citation needed |reason=The article doesn't mention that Super Mario Sunshine is exploration-based |date=April 2020}}\n\nThe game was developed by Nintendo's [[Entertainment Planning & Development]] division, and began development soon after the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a [[Sandbox game|sandbox]]-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''Super Mario 3D World'', which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed ''Super Mario Odyssey'' to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a vocal [[theme song]], \"Jump Up, Super Star!\", a first for the series.\n\n''Super Mario Odyssey'' received universal acclaim from critics who called it one of the best games in the series, as well as one of the greatest games of all time, with particular praise towards its inventiveness and originality.<!-- Do not add that some said it was the best of all time, this is not sourced anywhere in the article.--> It also won numerous awards, including for [[game of the year]]. The game was also a commercial success, selling over 16.59 million copies by December 2019, which makes it one of the [[best-selling Switch games]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = Super Mario Odyssey, Seaside Kingdom.png\n| caption1 = The player navigates the Seaside Kingdom as [[Mario]], controlling a [[Goomba]] Tower using Cappy's capture ability\n| image2 = Super Mario Odyssey, Cascade Kingdom.png\n| caption2 = A 2D zone in the Cascade Kingdom, one of many [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] sections that imitate the gameplay and visuals of the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n| width = 250\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n\n}}\n''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a [[platform game]] in which players control [[Mario]] as he travels across many different worlds, known as \"Kingdoms\", on the hat-shaped ship ''Odyssey'', to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Super Mario Odyssey brings Mario to Nintendo Switch, the \"real world\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-brings-mario-to-nintendo-switch-the-real-world/|access-date=January 13, 2017|work=Ars Technica|date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113052211/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-brings-mario-to-nintendo-switch-the-real-world/|archive-date=January 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tamburro|first1=Paul|title=Super Mario Odyssey is Going to be the Weirdest Mario Game Yet - CraveOnline|url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1277815-super-mario-odyssey-going-weirdest-mario-game-yet|access-date=June 13, 2017|work=CraveOnline|date=June 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807233404/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1277815-super-mario-odyssey-going-weirdest-mario-game-yet|archive-date=August 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Kingdoms in the game return to the exploration-based level design featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name=Business>{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Ben|title=Forget about that 'Super Mario' game on your iPhone \u2014 this is the new Mario game you're looking for|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-photos-video-2017-1/#its-used-to-great-effect-in-gameplay-in-this-instance-mario-throws-his-hat-and-it-floats-in-mid-air-thus-providing-a-platform-where-mario-can-bounce-to-more-sturdy-footing-11|access-date=January 15, 2017|work=Business Insider|date=January 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114202720/http://www.businessinsider.com/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-photos-video-2017-1/#its-used-to-great-effect-in-gameplay-in-this-instance-mario-throws-his-hat-and-it-floats-in-mid-air-thus-providing-a-platform-where-mario-can-bounce-to-more-sturdy-footing-11|archive-date=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Paste|title=Super Mario Odyssey Announced for the Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-the-nintendo-swi.html|access-date=January 15, 2017|work=Paste Magazine|date=January 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174524/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-the-nintendo-swi.html|archive-date=January 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Location>{{cite news|last1=Plante|first1=Chris|title=Super Mario Odyssey is an open world sandbox game for Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257408/nintendo-new-super-mario-odyssey-announced-switch|access-date=January 13, 2017|work=The Verge|date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114015639/http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257408/nintendo-new-super-mario-odyssey-announced-switch|archive-date=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Each Kingdom has Mario searching for and clearing various objectives in order to obtain [[Item (gaming)|items]] known as Power Moons, which can power up the ''Odyssey'' and grant access to new Kingdoms.

[[Mario]] attempts to rescue her but is thrown off the ship and falls into the neighboring Cap Kingdom. With Mario gone, Bowser stomps on Mario's cap and lets it drift into the ship's rear propellers, shredding it to pieces. A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy, one of the Cap Kingdom's sentient hat-like creatures; he explains to Mario that Bowser also kidnapped his sister Tiara to be used as Peach's wedding [[tiara]]. Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario's cap, providing him with the ability to temporarily capture other creatures and objects and utilize their abilities. They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom, recover an airship, the ''Odyssey'', and begin pursuing Bowser.\n\nMario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the ''Odyssey'' and battle the Broodals, who steal items including a dress, a cake, and a bouquet from each kingdom to set up Bowser's wedding. Eventually, they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom and defeat the Broodals for good. However, Bowser subsequently departs for his wedding on the [[Moon]]. Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon's surface and confront Bowser inside a [[cathedral]]. The two sides battle in a cavern, which Mario wins. He frees Peach and Tiara, but the cavern begins to collapse. Mario captures an unconscious Bowser and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara. After Peach thanks Mario for his help, Bowser regains consciousness and decides to properly propose to Peach, causing Mario to do the same in haste. Overwhelmed, Peach ends up rejecting both of them.

An entry in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series, it follows [[Mario]] and Cappy, a sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save [[Princess Peach]] from his nemesis [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.\n\nThe game was developed by Nintendo's [[Entertainment Planning & Development]] division, and began development soon after the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a [[Sandbox game|sandbox]]-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''Super Mario 3D World'', which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed ''Super Mario Odyssey'' to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a vocal [[theme song]], \"Jump Up, Super Star!\", a first for the series.\n\n''Super Mario Odyssey'' received universal acclaim from critics who called it one of the best games in the series, as well as one of the greatest games of all time, with particular praise towards its inventiveness and originality.<!-- Do not add that some said it was the best of all time, this is not sourced anywhere in the article.--> It also won numerous awards, including for [[game of the year]]. The game was also a commercial success, selling over 16.59 million copies by December 2019, which makes it one of the [[best-selling Switch games]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = Super Mario Odyssey, Seaside Kingdom.png\n| caption1 = The player navigates the Seaside Kingdom as [[Mario]], controlling a [[Goomba]] Tower using Cappy's capture ability\n| image2 = Super Mario Odyssey, Cascade Kingdom.png\n| caption2 = A 2D zone in the Cascade Kingdom, one of many [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] sections that imitate the gameplay and visuals of the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n| width = 250\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n\n}}\n''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a [[platform game]] in which players control [[Mario]] as he travels across many different worlds, known as \"Kingdoms\", on the hat-shaped ship ''Odyssey'', to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Super Mario Odyssey brings Mario to Nintendo Switch, the \"real world\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-brings-mario-to-nintendo-switch-the-real-world/|access-date=January 13, 2017|work=Ars Technica|date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113052211/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-brings-mario-to-nintendo-switch-the-real-world/|archive-date=January 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tamburro|first1=Paul|title=Super Mario Odyssey is Going to be the Weirdest Mario Game Yet - CraveOnline|url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1277815-super-mario-odyssey-going-weirdest-mario-game-yet|access-date=June 13, 2017|work=CraveOnline|date=June 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807233404/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1277815-super-mario-odyssey-going-weirdest-mario-game-yet|archive-date=August 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Kingdoms in the game return to the exploration-based level design featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name=Business>{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Ben|title=Forget about that 'Super Mario' game on your iPhone \u2014 this is the new Mario game you're looking for|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-photos-video-2017-1/#its-used-to-great-effect-in-gameplay-in-this-instance-mario-throws-his-hat-and-it-floats-in-mid-air-thus-providing-a-platform-where-mario-can-bounce-to-more-sturdy-footing-11|access-date=January 15, 2017|work=Business Insider|date=January 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114202720/http://www.businessinsider.com/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-photos-video-2017-1/#its-used-to-great-effect-in-gameplay-in-this-instance-mario-throws-his-hat-and-it-floats-in-mid-air-thus-providing-a-platform-where-mario-can-bounce-to-more-sturdy-footing-11|archive-date=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Paste|title=Super Mario Odyssey Announced for the Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-the-nintendo-swi.html|access-date=January 15, 2017|work=Paste Magazine|date=January 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174524/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-the-nintendo-swi.html|archive-date=January 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Location>{{cite news|last1=Plante|first1=Chris|title=Super Mario Odyssey is an open world sandbox game for Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257408/nintendo-new-super-mario-odyssey-announced-switch|access-date=January 13, 2017|work=The Verge|date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114015639/http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257408/nintendo-new-super-mario-odyssey-announced-switch|archive-date=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Each Kingdom has Mario searching for and clearing various objectives in order to obtain [[Item (gaming)|items]] known as Power Moons, which can power up the ''Odyssey'' and grant access to new Kingdoms.

[[Mario]] attempts to rescue her but is thrown off the ship and falls into the neighboring Cap Kingdom. With Mario gone, Bowser stomps on Mario's cap and lets it drift into the ship's rear propellers, shredding it to pieces. A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy, one of the Cap Kingdom's sentient hat-like creatures; he explains to Mario that Bowser also kidnapped his sister Tiara to be used as Peach's wedding [[tiara]]. Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario's cap, providing him with the ability to temporarily capture other creatures and objects and utilize their abilities. They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom, recover an airship, the ''Odyssey'', and begin pursuing Bowser.\n\nMario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the ''Odyssey'' and battle the Broodals, who steal items including a dress, a cake, and a bouquet from each kingdom to set up Bowser's wedding. Eventually, they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom and defeat the Broodals for good. However, Bowser subsequently departs for his wedding on the [[Moon]]. Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon's surface and confront Bowser inside a [[cathedral]]. The two sides battle in a cavern, which Mario wins. He frees Peach and Tiara, but the cavern begins to collapse. Mario captures an unconscious Bowser and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara. After Peach thanks Mario for his help, Bowser regains consciousness and decides to properly propose to Peach, causing Mario to do the same in haste. Overwhelmed, Peach ends up rejecting both of them. Peach, Cappy and Tiara board the ''Odyssey''.  The rivals are both broken until Peach tells Mario that it's time to go home. Mario boards the ship just in time, leaving Bowser stranded on the Moon. In the epilogue, Mario returns to the Mushroom Kingdom, where he discovers Peach has packed her bags and left for parts unknown without the knowledge of her servants.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Yoshiaki Koizumi at E3 2013 (cropped).JPG|thumb|200px|Longtime Nintendo designer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] served as the lead producer of the game|alt=Yoshiaki Koizumi]]\nThe game's development began after ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' released in late 2013, and was created by the same development team with assistance from [[1-Up Studio]].{{r|Kotaku: E3 preview}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/08/next-3d-mario-game-in-development|title=Next 3D Mario Game in Development|last=Campbell|first=Evan|date=April 8, 2014|website=IGN|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130102701/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/08/next-3d-mario-game-in-development|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=June 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stevens |first1=Colin |title=The State of Nintendo\u2019s Development Teams |url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/05/16/the-state-of-nintendos-development-teams/299202/ |website=Hardcore Gamer |accessdate=12 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812213913/https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/05/16/the-state-of-nintendos-development-teams/299202/ |archive-date=August 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Under director Kenta Motokura, the team experimented to find fun concepts based on the series' \"theme of surprise\".

Girl]]'' (1978) with [[Sissy Spacek]].\n\nDa Silva's TV guest appearances, after the era in which blacklisting was strongest, include such programs as ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Gentle Ben]]'', ''[[Mannix]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]''.\n\nDa Silva also played President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in ''[[The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover]]'' (1977), Hollywood mogul [[Louis B. Mayer]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), and American statesman [[Benjamin Franklin]] in ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' (1972), as well as a documentary depicting the life of Ben Franklin shown at Franklin's house in Philadelphia. He appeared in two different film adaptations of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s 1925 novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. In the [[The Great Gatsby (1949 film)|1949 production]] with [[Alan Ladd]] as Gatsby, Da Silva played garage owner George Wilson; in the [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|1974 film]] with [[Robert Redford]], Da Silva was Meyer Wolfsheim, the flamboyant gambler with the interesting cufflinks. In his final appearance on screen, Da Silva played a New York photographer fascinated with the reclusive [[Greta Garbo]] in the film ''[[Garbo Talks]]'' (1984), directed by [[Sidney Lumet]].\n\nHe also did voice acting in 26 episodes of the popular 1974\u201382 radio thriller series ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'' (between July 1974 and February 1977).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbsrmt.mousetrap.net/RMTdb/sp.php?id=hdasilva|title=CBS Radio Mystery Theater Database|accessdate=2008-05-10}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1978, he recorded linking narration for episodes of the British [[television program]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' broadcast in the United States.\n\n==Blacklisting==\nDa Silva became one of hundreds of artists [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in the entertainment industry during the [[House Committee on Unamerican Activities]] investigation into alleged [[communism|Communist]] influence in the industry. Following his March 1951 testimony in which he repeatedly invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights,<ref>Ryskind (2015), pp. 391\u2013393</ref> his lead performance in the completed feature film ''[[Slaughter Trail]]'' was re-shot with actor [[Brian Donlevy]].<ref name=146Humphries>Humphries (2010), p.146</ref> <!-- Requires support from reliable source or sources. --> Da Silva continued to find work on the New York stage, but did not work in feature films again until 1961 when he appeared in ''[[David and Lisa]]'' (a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-nominated performance).<ref name=BAFTA/><ref>Buhle, Wagner (2004), p. 291</ref>  He was eventually cleared of any charges in 1960,<ref>Ghiglione (2008), p. ebook</ref> but not before his career in television had also stalled, with no work between 1951 and 1959 when he appeared in ''[[The Play of the Week]]''. The brief respite was followed by another television career void until his appearance in a 1963 episode of [[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|''The Defenders'']]. That was the beginning of the end of Da Silva's blacklist, and the show's producer [[Herb Brodkin]] paired Da Silva with [[William Shatner]] when he created the television series [[For the People (1965 TV series)|''For the People'']].<ref>Shatner, Fisher (2008), pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDa Silva married actress [[Marjorie Nelson]] in 1949.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/78/Howard-Da-Silva.html Biography at filmreference.com]</ref> Da Silva and Nelson divorced in 1960.

His narration accompanied the earliest runs of Doctor Who as broadcast on American PBS stations and Canadian broadcasters like TVOntario during the 1970s and early 1980s. Typically, after Doctor Who had been run on a station for a while, the linking narration was removed as unnecessary. Nevertheless, the announcements were so familiar a part of some viewers' experience of Doctor Who that they became a standard extra feature on BBC DVD releases of early Tom Baker serials.\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n=== References ===\n*{{cite book|last1=Buhle|first1=Paul|last2=Wagner|first2=David|title=Hide in Plain Sight: The Hollywood Blacklistees in Film and Television, 1950\u20132002|date=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmilla|isbn=978-1-4039-6684-1}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Hal|title=Encyclopedia of Television Law Shows|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3828-0}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Frommer|first1=Myrna Katz|last2=Frommer|first2=Harvey|title=It Happened on Broadway: An Oral History of the Great White Way|date=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-58979-916-5}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Gertel|first1=Elliott|title=Over the Top Judaism: Precedents and Trends in the Depiction of Jewish Beliefs and Observances in Film and Television|date=2003|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-2624-8}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Ghiglione|first1=Loren|title=CBS's Don Hollenbeck An Honest Reporter in the Age of McCarthyism|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51689-1|url=https://archive.org/details/cbssdonhollenbec0000ghig}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Heitland|first1=Jon|title=The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

Girl]]'' (1978) with [[Sissy Spacek]].\n\nDa Silva's TV guest appearances, after the era in which blacklisting was strongest, include such programs as ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Gentle Ben]]'', ''[[Mannix]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]''.\n\nDa Silva also played President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in ''[[The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover]]'' (1977), Hollywood mogul [[Louis B. Mayer]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), and American statesman [[Benjamin Franklin]] in ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' (1972), as well as a documentary depicting the life of Ben Franklin shown at Franklin's house in Philadelphia. He appeared in two different film adaptations of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s 1925 novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. In the [[The Great Gatsby (1949 film)|1949 production]] with [[Alan Ladd]] as Gatsby, Da Silva played garage owner George Wilson; in the [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|1974 film]] with [[Robert Redford]], Da Silva was Meyer Wolfsheim, the flamboyant gambler with the interesting cufflinks. In his final appearance on screen, Da Silva played a New York photographer fascinated with the reclusive [[Greta Garbo]] in the film ''[[Garbo Talks]]'' (1984), directed by [[Sidney Lumet]].\n\nHe also did voice acting in 26 episodes of the popular 1974\u201382 radio thriller series ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'' (between July 1974 and February 1977).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbsrmt.mousetrap.net/RMTdb/sp.php?id=hdasilva|title=CBS Radio Mystery Theater Database|accessdate=2008-05-10}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1978, he recorded linking narration for episodes of the British [[television program]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' broadcast in the United States.\n\n==Blacklisting==\nDa Silva became one of hundreds of artists [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in the entertainment industry during the [[House Committee on Unamerican Activities]] investigation into alleged [[communism|Communist]] influence in the industry. Following his March 1951 testimony in which he repeatedly invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights,<ref>Ryskind (2015), pp. 391\u2013393</ref> his lead performance in the completed feature film ''[[Slaughter Trail]]'' was re-shot with actor [[Brian Donlevy]].<ref name=146Humphries>Humphries (2010), p.146</ref> <!-- Requires support from reliable source or sources. --> Da Silva continued to find work on the New York stage, but did not work in feature films again until 1961 when he appeared in his [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominated performance in ''[[David and Lisa]]''.<ref name=BAFTA/><ref>Buhle, Wagner (2004), p. 291</ref>  He was eventually cleared of any charges in 1960,<ref>Ghiglione (2008), p. ebook</ref> but not before his career in television had also stalled, with no work between 1951 and 1959 when he appeared in ''[[The Play of the Week]]''. The brief respite was followed by another television career void until his appearance in a 1963 episode of [[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|''The Defenders'']]. That was the beginning of the end of Da Silva's blacklist, and the show's producer [[Herb Brodkin]] paired Da Silva with [[William Shatner]] when he created the television series [[For the People (1965 TV series)|''For the People'']].<ref>Shatner, Fisher (2008), pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDa Silva married actress [[Marjorie Nelson]] in 1949.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/78/Howard-Da-Silva.html Biography at filmreference.com]</ref> Da Silva and Nelson divorced in 1960.

His narration accompanied the earliest runs of Doctor Who as broadcast on American PBS stations and Canadian broadcasters like TVOntario during the 1970s and early 1980s. Typically, after Doctor Who had been run on a station for a while, the linking narration was removed as unnecessary. Nevertheless, the announcements were so familiar a part of some viewers' experience of Doctor Who that they became a standard extra feature on BBC DVD releases of early Tom Baker serials.\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n=== References ===\n*{{cite book|last1=Buhle|first1=Paul|last2=Wagner|first2=David|title=Hide in Plain Sight: The Hollywood Blacklistees in Film and Television, 1950\u20132002|date=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmilla|isbn=978-1-4039-6684-1}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Hal|title=Encyclopedia of Television Law Shows|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3828-0}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Frommer|first1=Myrna Katz|last2=Frommer|first2=Harvey|title=It Happened on Broadway: An Oral History of the Great White Way|date=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-58979-916-5}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Gertel|first1=Elliott|title=Over the Top Judaism: Precedents and Trends in the Depiction of Jewish Beliefs and Observances in Film and Television|date=2003|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-2624-8}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Ghiglione|first1=Loren|title=CBS's Don Hollenbeck An Honest Reporter in the Age of McCarthyism|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51689-1|url=https://archive.org/details/cbssdonhollenbec0000ghig}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Heitland|first1=Jon|title=The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
