It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).

However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and another where the player is dropped into a ''[[Minecraft]]'' world. These sections were included after getting approval from their creators [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and [[Markus Persson]], respectively.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/202359/Behind_the_scenes_with_The_Stanley_Parable.php | title = Behind the scenes with The Stanley Parable | first = Mike | last = Rose | date = 2013-10-17 | accessdate = 2013-10-17 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\nTo distribute the new version, the team initially considered a [[pay what you want]] scheme,<ref name=\"rps\" /> but later sought the use of the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] Greenlight service, where independent developers can solicit votes from other players in order to have Valve subsequently offer the title through Steam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/13/stanley-clicked-yes-the-stanley-parable-returns/ | title = Stanley Clicked \"YES\": The Stanley Parable Returns | first = John | last = Walker | date = 2012-09-13 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> In October 2012, the game was successfully approved by Valve to be included on Steam upon the game's completion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/16/postal-dad-stanliest-gnome-21-new-games-greenlit/ | title = Postal Dad: Stanliest Gnome&nbsp;\u2013 21 New Games Greenlit | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = 2012-10-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Although Wreden originally called the stand-alone version ''The Stanley Parable: HD Remix'', he later opted to drop the distinguishing title, affirming that he believes the remake is the \"definitive\" version of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/95511356/1376845925 | title = About that name... | first = Dave | last = Wreden | date = 2013-08-13 | accessdate = 2013-10-15 | publisher = Dave Wreden }}</ref> The OS X version (requiring 10.8 or later) was released on December 19, 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/12/19/the-stanley-parable-now-available-for-mac.aspx|title=The Stanley Parable Now Available For Mac|last=Futter|first=Mike|date=2013-12-19|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> and support for Linux was added on September 9, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-stanley-parable-released-for-linux-you-will-play-it-you-wont-play-it.5919|title=The Stanley Parable Released For Linux, You Will Play It, You Won\u2019t Play it|last=Dawe|first=Liam|date=September 9, 2015|website=GamingOnLinux|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TheStanleyParable DemoFacility.png|thumb|''The Stanley Parable''<nowiki/>'s demo takes place in a \"demo construction facility\", a setting entirely separate from the main game.|alt=A storage facility with grey floors and off-white walls.

The entire image is repeated within the computer monitor.\n}}\n\n'''''The Stanley Parable''''' is an [[interactive drama]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] designed by American developer Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Really the seed of the game was just that one question, a desire to know what would happen if you were able to disobey the narrator, and I had no idea, so I just went about making it to find out.\n| author = Davey Wreden\n| source = 2011 ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' interview<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/535qn3/the-man-behind-the-deconstructionist-mod-ithe-stanley-parablei|title=The Man Behind The Deconstructionist Mod The Stanley Parable|last=Finch|first=Greg|date=2011-08-12|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n| width = 33%\n}}\n\nDavey Wreden, 22 years old at the time of the [[Mod (video games)|mod]]'s release, was inspired to create ''The Stanley Parable'' about three years prior,<ref name=\"rps\" /> after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thinking of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; he also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer.<ref name=\"kotaku\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5829254/the-stanley-parable-turns-video-game-storytelling-on-its-head | title = The Stanley Parable Turns Video Game Storytelling On Its Head | publisher = [[Kotaku]] | date = 2011-08-09 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | first = Kirk | last = Hamilton }}</ref><ref name=\"shacknews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/70363/interview-davey-wreden-on-stanley-parable-remake-and-self-taught | title = Interview: The Stanley Parable developer Davey Wreden | first = Jeff | last =Matias | date = 2011-09-27 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}</ref> As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for \"what if\" questions that the player may consider.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> He considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' series, ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'', and ''[[BioShock]]'', started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to stop and think about the narration instead of simply going through the motions.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> According to Wreden, his [[design document]] for the game was \"Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them.\"<ref name=\"wired\" />\n\n[[File:DaveyWreden_2014Gameloading.png|thumb|Davey Wreden in a 2014 GameLoading interview<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Btc34eRsN8|title=Davey Wreden - Empowerment Through Games|last=GameLoading|first=|date=October 20, 2014|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>|alt=Davey Wreden in the middle of speaking, making a wide gesture with both his hands.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).

However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and another where the player is dropped into a ''[[Minecraft]]'' world. These sections were included after getting approval from their creators [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and [[Markus Persson]], respectively.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/202359/Behind_the_scenes_with_The_Stanley_Parable.php | title = Behind the scenes with The Stanley Parable | first = Mike | last = Rose | date = 2013-10-17 | accessdate = 2013-10-17 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\nTo distribute the new version, the team initially considered a [[pay what you want]] scheme,<ref name=\"rps\" /> but later sought the use of the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] Greenlight service, where independent developers can solicit votes from other players in order to have Valve subsequently offer the title through Steam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/13/stanley-clicked-yes-the-stanley-parable-returns/ | title = Stanley Clicked \"YES\": The Stanley Parable Returns | first = John | last = Walker | date = 2012-09-13 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> In October 2012, the game was successfully approved by Valve to be included on Steam upon the game's completion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/16/postal-dad-stanliest-gnome-21-new-games-greenlit/ | title = Postal Dad: Stanliest Gnome&nbsp;\u2013 21 New Games Greenlit | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = 2012-10-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Although Wreden originally called the stand-alone version ''The Stanley Parable: HD Remix'', he later opted to drop the distinguishing title, affirming that he believes the remake is the \"definitive\" version of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/95511356/1376845925 | title = About that name... | first = Dave | last = Wreden | date = 2013-08-13 | accessdate = 2013-10-15 | publisher = Dave Wreden }}</ref> The OS X version (requiring 10.8 or later) was released on December 19, 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/12/19/the-stanley-parable-now-available-for-mac.aspx|title=The Stanley Parable Now Available For Mac|last=Futter|first=Mike|date=2013-12-19|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> and support for Linux was added on September 9, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-stanley-parable-released-for-linux-you-will-play-it-you-wont-play-it.5919|title=The Stanley Parable Released For Linux, You Will Play It, You Won\u2019t Play it|last=Dawe|first=Liam|date=September 9, 2015|website=GamingOnLinux|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TheStanleyParable DemoFacility.png|thumb|''The Stanley Parable''<nowiki/>'s demo takes place in a \"demo construction facility\", a setting entirely separate from the main game.|alt=A storage facility with grey floors and off-white walls.

He was raised in the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|borough of Greenwich]] (Thamesmead), where he began [[performing arts]] at an early age of 8, meanwhile writing songs in his spare time. Fahd eventually focused on music & acting from he's a long-existing list of talents such as dancing, singing, sprinting and basketball. Before engaging in music, his primary school appointed him to weekly trumpet lessons. After a prolonged trip to [[Liverpool]], Fahd's family relocated to the county of [[Greater Manchester]] in a town called [[Wythenshawe]].\n\nKing-Fahd attended St Mary's, a catholic [[Independent school|private school]] in Ibn, and, later, Linton Mead Primary School in [[Thamesmead]]. Following the move to [[Manchester]], he transferred from The Halley Academy ([[The Halley Academy|Corelli College)]] to [[Manchester Enterprise Academy]], where he studies sports, musical theatre and business, while also representing his school in all school plays and few basketball & football games.\n\n==Music Career==\nFahd made his debut appearance on an [[Instagram]] freestyle called 'Run the streets down'. After reaching a respectable point of his old channel, Fahd made a new brand channel focusing on all his musical content. Fahd was expected to release a debut [[freestyle]] throughout 2019 \u2018Original Ends (0EnDs)\u2019 as he explained but instead released 2 [[Single (music)|singles]] on he\u2019s YouTube channel. A Christmas special \u2018Wishlist\u2019 and own version of SJ\u2019s \u2018Youngest In Charge\u2019 which both did well in terms of views but in terms of positive feedback, not so well. Shortly the singles were unavailable, deleted. His rebranded himself, changing his professional name from FahdHilfiger to Fahd. Fahd's debut single 'Left on read' blew up around his local area back in [[Wythenshawe]], where he gained attention for the [[Manchester|Mancunian]] youths, talent pages and young stars. 'Left on read' was a very controversial single, some saying it was good for a debut single, some claiming it's too repetitive and annoyingly catchy.
