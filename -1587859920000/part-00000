Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families \u2013 Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralized the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

At the same time, Marthanda Varma also brought 12,000 [[shaligram]]s, [[aniconism|aniconic]] representations of [[Vishnu]], from the [[Gandaki River]], north of Benares (now known as [[Varanasi]]) to the temple. These were used in the reconsecration of the Padmanabha.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times|last1=Menon|first1=P.

Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the \"Ottakkal Mandapam\".

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies \u2013 Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi \u2013 are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple \u2013 This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple.

Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archeologist and historian, totaling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents \u2013 segregated under 70 \"heads\" \u2013 is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key.

This portion came to be known as Mahabharatakonam and covered the ground underneath which both Kallara B and Kallara A were situated.<ref>Letter of His Holiness the Pushpanjali Swamiyar to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan</ref>\n\nAccording to a popular legend, many Devas and Sages devoted to Lord Balarama visited Him on the banks of Padmateertham. They requested Him that they may be permitted to reside there worshipping the Lord. Balarama granted them their wish. It is believed that these Devas and Sages reside in Kallara B worshipping the Lord. [[N\u0101ga|Naga]] Devathas devoted to the Lord also dwell in this Kallara.<ref>\"Sri Padmanabho Rakshatu\" by G Sekharan Nair, Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 17 September 2017</ref> [[Kanjirottu Yakshi]], whose enchanting and ferocious forms are painted on the south-west part of the main Sanctum, resides in this Kallara worshipping Lord Narasimha.<ref>Bayi, Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi.

Lord Ugra [[Narasimha]] of Thekkedom is said to be the Protector of Kallara B. There is a serpent's image on Kallara B indicating danger to anyone who opens it. A four-day [[Ashtamangala prasnam|Ashtamangala Devaprasnam]] conducted in August 2011 declared Kallara B as \"forbidden zone\".<ref name=\"The Hindu dated July 7, 2011\">The Hindu dated 7 July 2011</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the antechamber to Kallara B was opened by the Observers appointed by the Supreme Court of India.<ref>The Hindu dated 29 June 2011</ref> But the Observers could not open Kallara B. However, Gopal Subramanium in his report submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2014, recommended its opening after conducting another Devaprasnam. The two Pushpanjali Swamiyars are the highest spiritual dignitaries of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Naduvil Madhom sent letters to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee and the Executive Officer on 8 February 2016 expressing his strong opposition to the opening of Kallara B.<ref>Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 26 February 2016</ref> The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Munchira Madhom led a Ratha Yathra from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in May 2018 campaigning against opening the sacred Kallara. [[Azhvanchery Thamprakkal]], the supreme spiritual leader of Kerala Brahmins, while addressing a meeting held in connection with the Ratha Yathra also demanded that faith should not be trampled upon by opening Kallara B.<ref>Mathrubhumi and Malayala Manorama, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 14 May 2018</ref>\n\n[[Mukilan's invasion of Venad|Mukilan]], a Muslim marauder, invaded vast chunks of Venad in 1680 AD.<ref>Menon, P Shungoonny.

Mukilan had plans to plunder the vaults of Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple and destroy it. But he was dissuaded from doing so by local Pathans loyal to the Royals of Venad.   Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, [[Pallichal Pillai]] and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Kallara B was opened after the 1880s. An article by Emily Gilchrist,  a visiting Englishwoman in the 1933, recalls in her book 'Travancore: A Guide Book for the Visitor' (Oxford University Press, 1933) about an unsuccessful attempt to open one Kallara in 1908: \"About 25 years ago, when the State needed additional money, it was thought expedient to open these chests and use the wealth they contained.\" \"A group of people\" got together and attempted to enter the vaults with torches.

Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "text_old": "{{manual|date=August 2017}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox temple\n| image              = TVM Padmanabhaswamy Temple.jpg\n| alt                =\n| caption            =\n| coordinates        ={{coord|8|28|58|N|76|56|37|E|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| country            = [[India]]\n| state              = [[Kerala]]\n| district           =\n| location           = [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n| elevation_m        =\n| deity = [[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]]\n| architecture       = Fusion of [[Architecture of Kerala|Kerala Architecture]] and [[ Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Architecture]]\n| inscriptions       =\n| creator            =\n| website            = [http://spst.in/ Official website]\n}}\n\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nThe '''Padmanabhaswamy temple''' is a [[Hindu temple]] located in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the state capital of [[Kerala]], [[India]].

King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralized the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple - This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\n==Extant temple records==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nA pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.<ref name=\"frontline.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past|publisher=}}</ref> A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf-records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archeologist and historian, totaling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents - segregated under 70 \"heads\" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key.

The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it.

The IB cites Mr Subramaniam's report on Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as one of the instances where he relied heavily on his spiritual instincts rather than rational logic and hard facts.<ref name=\"The Economic Times, June 25, 2014\">The Economic Times, June 25, 2014</ref> In his second report on Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Mr Subramaniam himself reveals,\"It was his morning ritual of [shutting] his mind and seeking guidance, which resulted in discoveries in this direction.\"<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 9</ref>\n\nThe Amicus Curiae has also been accused of conducting poojas in the Temple in violation of its customs.<ref name=\"The Economic Times, June 25, 2014\"/> He performed poojas at the Thevarappura in the Temple and in front of the Vedavyasa Shrine. Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript, date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmanabhaswamy_Temple"}

Hardwick''''', 478 U.S. 186 (1986), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld, in a 5\u20134 ruling, the constitutionality of a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[sodomy law]] criminalizing [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual sodomy and heterosexual sodomy.<ref name=\"decision\">{{ussc|name=Bowers v. Hardwick|478|186|1986}}.</ref> This case was overturned in 2003 in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', though the Georgia statute had already been struck down in 1998.\n\nThe majority opinion, by Justice [[Byron White]], reasoned that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not confer \u201ca fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy\u201d.<ref name=\"decision\"/> A concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] cited the \u201cancient roots\u201d of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting [[William Blackstone]]\u2019s description of homosexual sex as an \u201cinfamous crime against nature\u201d, worse than rape, and \u201ca crime not fit to be named\u201d. Burger concluded: \u201cTo hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.\u201d<ref name=\"concurrence\"/> Justice [[Lewis F. Powell]] later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.\n\nThe senior dissent, by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an \u201calmost obsessive focus on homosexual activity\" and an \u201coverall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases\u201d. In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: \u201cThat certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.\u201d<ref name=\"blackmun-dissent\">''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 211 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nSeventeen years after ''Bowers v. Hardwick'', the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',<ref name=Lawrence>{{ussc|name=Lawrence v. Texas|volume=539|page=558|pin=|year=2003}}.</ref> and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.\n\n==Background==\nIn early July 1982, [[Atlanta Police Department (Georgia)|Atlanta police]] officer Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a citation for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle into a trash can outside the gay bar where he worked, allegedly observing him violating the city's ordinance that prohibits drinking in public.<ref name=nussbaum>{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195305319|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fromdisgusttohum00nuss}}</ref> Due to a clerical error on the citation issued by Torick, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying a $50 fine at a court office, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's house three weeks later, on August 3, to serve the now-invalid warrant.<ref name=eskridge>{{cite book|last1=Eskridge|first1=William N.|title=Sodomy Laws in America, 1861-2003|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dishonorablepass00eskr/page/232 232\u2013234]|isbn=9780670018628|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dishonorablepass00eskr/page/232}}</ref><ref name=\"Murdoch and Price\">{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Joyce|last2=Price|first2=Deb|title=Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians V.

Torick later stated that he \"would never have made the case if [Hardwick] hadn't had an attitude problem.\"<ref name=eskridge/> Torick then arrested both men for [[sodomy]], a felony under Georgia law that carried a sentence of one to twenty years' imprisonment.<ref>Georgia Code Ann. \u00a7 16-6-2 (1984)</ref> District Attorney Lewis Slaton chose not to prosecute the sodomy charge, considering that the warrant had expired, and his own belief that the sodomy law should not be used to prosecute consensual sexual activity.<ref name=eskridge/>\n\nHardwick then sued [[Mike Bowers|Michael Bowers]], the [[attorney general]] of Georgia, in federal court for a [[declaratory judgment]] that the state's sodomy law was invalid. He charged that as a non-celibate gay man, he was liable to eventually be prosecuted for his activities. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had been searching for a \u201cperfect test case\u201d to challenge anti-sodomy laws, and Hardwick's cause presented the one they were looking for.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=279}} They approached Hardwick, who agreed to be represented by ACLU attorneys.\n\nIn the lower federal courts, Hardwick was represented by attorney Kathleen Wilde. The case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]], where it was dismissed, with the Court ruling in favor of Bowers. Hardwick appealed, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] reversed the lower court, finding that the Georgia sodomy statute was indeed an infringement upon Hardwick's Constitutional rights.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Hardwick v. Bowers |vol=760 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1202 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1985 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/760/1202/75648/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}</ref> The State of Georgia then appealed, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted [[certiorari]] on November&nbsp;4, 1985, to review the case.\n\nHardwick was represented before the Supreme Court by [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Laurence Tribe]]. Michael Hobbs, assistant attorney general, argued the case for the State. The legality of the officer's entry into Hardwick's home was not contested; only the constitutionality of the sodomy statute was challenged.\n\nA heterosexual married couple was initially named in the suit as plaintiffs [[John Doe|John and Mary Doe]], alleging that they wished to engage in sodomy but were prevented from doing so by the Georgia anti-sodomy law.<ref name=\"decision\" /> But they failed to obtain [[Standing (law)|standing]] and were dropped from the suit.<ref name=\"decision\" />\n\n==Opinion of the Court==\nThe Court issued a 5-4 ruling upholding the sodomy laws. Justice [[Byron White]] wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Warren E. Burger]], and [[Lewis F. Powell]]. Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote a dissent joined by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[John Paul Stevens]]. Stevens also wrote a dissent joined by Brennan and Marshall.\n\n===Majority opinion===\nThe issue in ''Bowers'' involved the right of [[privacy]]. Since 1965's ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'',<ref name=Griswold>{{ussc|name=Griswold v.

In ''Bowers'', the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in ''Bowers'', written by Justice [[Byron White]], framed the legal question as whether the constitution confers \u201ca fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.\u201d The opinion answered this question in the negative, stating that \u201cto claim that a right to engage in such conduct is \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019 or \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u2019 is, at best, facetious.\u201d\n\nJustice White added a [[slippery slope]] warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws: <blockquote>And if respondent's submission is limited to the voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct [p196] while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home. We are unwilling to start down that road.</blockquote>\n\n===Chief Justice Burger's concurrence===\nThe short concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] emphasized historical negative attitudes toward homosexual sex, quoting Sir [[William Blackstone]]\u2019s characterization of sodomy as \u201ca crime not fit to be named\u201d.<ref name=\"concurrence\">''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 197 (Burger, C.J., concurring).</ref> Burger concluded, \u201cTo hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.\u201d\n\n===Justice Powell's concurrence===\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] joined the majority opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. But he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia's law with the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, the question of the statute's constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did not come up in the case.\n\nPowell was considered the deciding vote during the case. He had initially voted to strike down the law but changed his mind after conservative clerk [[Michael W. Mosman]] advised him to uphold the ban.<ref>[http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-9252-domestic_partner_decision_revisiting_old_wounds.html Domestic Partner Decision: Revisiting Old Wounds?], ''Willamette Week''</ref><ref>Shilts, p. 523</ref> It has been claimed that Powell's decision to uphold the law was influenced by his belief that he had never known any [[homosexual]]s, even though one of his own law clerks was gay.<ref>[[Edward Lazarus|Lazarus, Edward]]. ''[[Closed Chambers]]: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court,'' p. 386. \u201cAt the ''Bowers'' conference, Powell told his colleagues that he had \u2018never met a homosexual\u2019.\u201d</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Extreme Makeover: The story behind the story of Lawrence v.

Blackmun wrote, \"Only the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy is 'a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality{{'-}}\u201d (ironically quoting from Burger's opinion in ''[[Paris Adult Theatre I v.

The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.<ref name=Griswold/> Nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]''<ref>{{ussc|name=Eisenstadt v. Baird|volume=405|page=438|pin=|year=1972}}.</ref> had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.\n\n====Subsequent findings====\nAccording to Daniel Richman, former law clerk for Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], Marshall's friendship with [[civil rights]] leader [[Bayard Rustin]] and Rustin's openness about his homosexuality played a significant role in Marshall's decision to join both dissents. Richman also recalled that Marshall thought that the case was a \"no-brainer\", and told Richman, who wrote a bench memo for Marshall on the case, that \"this [case] is controlled by [[Stanley v. Georgia|''Stanley'']]\".{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=292}}\n\n==Subsequent events==\n\n===Hardwick===\nMichael Hardwick died in 1991 of complications from [[AIDS]].

We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy.\u201d State sodomy laws were seldom enforced against private, consensual conduct in the decades following the decision, though many courts and state governments interpreted it to justify a wide variety of bans and limitations on the lives of [[gay]] people.<ref name=\"keen\">{{cite news |title=Strangers to the Law: Gay People on Trial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keen-law.html |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Lisa Keen |author2=Susanne B.

In addition, a number of state courts invalidated sodomy laws under privacy or other provisions of their state constitutions. The same sodomy law that was upheld in ''Bowers'' was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court under the Georgia state constitution in the case of ''[[Powell v. Georgia|Powell v.

Texas]]'',<ref name=Lawrence/> which explicitly overturned ''Bowers''. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas|Lawrence]]'', ruling that Texas's state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one's home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause). Kennedy wrote: \u201c''Bowers'' was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. ''Bowers v.

Connecticut|volume=381|page=479|pin=|year=1965}}.</ref> the Court had held that a right to privacy was implicit in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In ''Bowers'', the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in ''Bowers'', written by Justice [[Byron White]], framed the legal question as whether the constitution confers \u201ca fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.\u201d The opinion answered this question in the negative, stating that \u201cto claim that a right to engage in such conduct is \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019 or \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u2019 is, at best, facetious.\u201d\n\nJustice White added a [[slippery slope]] warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws: <blockquote>And if respondent's submission is limited to the voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct [p196] while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home. We are unwilling to start down that road.</blockquote>\n\n===Chief Justice Burger's concurrence===\nThe short concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] emphasized historical negative attitudes toward homosexual sex, quoting Sir [[William Blackstone]]\u2019s characterization of sodomy as \u201ca crime not fit to be named\u201d.<ref name=\"concurrence\">''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 197 (Burger, C.J., concurring).</ref> Burger concluded, \u201cTo hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.\u201d\n\n===Justice Powell's concurrence===\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] joined the majority opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. But he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia's law with the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, the question of the statute's constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did not come up in the case.\n\nPowell was considered the deciding vote during the case. He had initially voted to strike down the law but changed his mind after conservative clerk [[Michael W. Mosman]] advised him to uphold the ban.<ref>[http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-9252-domestic_partner_decision_revisiting_old_wounds.html Domestic Partner Decision: Revisiting Old Wounds?], ''Willamette Week''</ref><ref>Shilts, p. 523</ref> It has been claimed that Powell's decision to uphold the law was influenced by his belief that he had never known any [[homosexual]]s, even though one of his own law clerks was gay.<ref>[[Edward Lazarus|Lazarus, Edward]]. ''[[Closed Chambers]]: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court,'' p. 386. \u201cAt the ''Bowers'' conference, Powell told his colleagues that he had \u2018never met a homosexual\u2019.\u201d</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Extreme Makeover: The story behind the story of Lawrence v. Texas |author=Dahlia Lithwick |date=12 March 2012 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/03/12/120312crbo_books_lithwick?google_editors_picks=true |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}</ref> But that clerk has said that Powell had met his boyfriend, and that Powell had asked him about the mechanisms of homosexual sex when deciding the case. He felt that Powell had made the remark in order to avoid revealing that one of his clerks was gay at a time when such a revelation could have destroyed that clerk's future legal career. Journalists have since found that Powell hired more gay law clerks than any of the other justices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Exhibit ''A'' for a Major Shift: Justices' Gay Clerks |date=June 10, 2013 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/us/exhibit-a-for-a-major-shift-justices-gay-clerks.html?pagewanted=2&src=recg |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Dissents===\n\n====Justice Blackmun's dissent====\nA sharply worded dissenting opinion by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] attacked the majority opinion as having an \"almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity\". Blackmun wrote, \"Only the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy is 'a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality{{'-}}\u201d (ironically quoting from Burger's opinion in ''[[Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton]]'', which held that obscene films are not constitutionally protected). The dissent compared the majority opinion to that in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Minersville School District v. Gobitis|volume=310|page=586|pin=|year=1940}}.</ref> which was reversed by the Court after only three years.<ref>{{ussc|name=West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|volume=319|page=624|pin=|year=1943}}.</ref>\n\nBlackmun revealed in a 1995 [[oral history]] with [[Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh]] that his dissent in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' was written primarily by Blackmun's [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]] clerk [[Pamela S. Karlan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/groups-push-for-first-gay-justice-022106|title=Groups push for first gay justice|work=POLITICO|date=2009-05-05|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/stanford-law-professor-pam-karlan-concludes-2006-acs-national-convention|title=Stanford Law Professor Pam Karlan Concludes 2006 ACS National Convention {{!}} ACS|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en|date=2006-06-26}}</ref> Blackmun said of the dissent, \"Karlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_04_17-2005_04_23.shtml#1114025448 |title=The Volokh Conspiracy |publisher=Volokh.com |accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref>\n\n====Justice Stevens's dissent====\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote a separate dissent that focused on the selective enforcement of the law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.<ref name=Griswold/> Nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]''<ref>{{ussc|name=Eisenstadt v. Baird|volume=405|page=438|pin=|year=1972}}.</ref> had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.\n\n====Subsequent findings====\nAccording to Daniel Richman, former law clerk for Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], Marshall's friendship with [[civil rights]] leader [[Bayard Rustin]] and Rustin's openness about his homosexuality played a significant role in Marshall's decision to join both dissents. Richman also recalled that Marshall thought that the case was a \"no-brainer\", and told Richman, who wrote a bench memo for Marshall on the case, that \"this [case] is controlled by [[Stanley v. Georgia|''Stanley'']]\".{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=292}}\n\n==Subsequent events==\n\n===Hardwick===\nMichael Hardwick died in 1991 of complications from [[AIDS]]. According to his lawyer Kathleen Wilde, he died very bitter about the outcome of the case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unlikely Allies in a Gay Rights Battle in Georgia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/07/us/unlikely-allies-in-a-gay-rights-battle-in-georgia.html |accessdate=8 Dec 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Richard Fausset}}</ref>\n\n===Jurisprudence===\n''Bowers'' was decided at a time when the court's privacy jurisprudence, and in particular the right to abortion recognized in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''<ref>{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=|year=1973}}.</ref> had come under heavy criticism. ''Bowers'' signaled a reluctance by the Court to recognize a general constitutional right to privacy or to extend such a right further than they already had.<ref>{{cite web |last=Franke |first=Katherine |title=Dignifying Rights: A Comment on Jeremy Waldron's 'Dignity, Rights, and Responsibilities' |url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/faculty_franke/Dignifying%20Rights%20%28Final%20Proof%29.pdf |publisher=Columbia Law School |accessdate=12 June 2013 |page=1188}}</ref>\n\nThe Georgia law upheld in ''Bowers'' criminalized oral sex and anal sex whether engaged in by people of the same sex or different sexes, but White's decision was restricted to homosexual sex. \u201cThe only claim properly before the Court, therefore, is Hardwick\u2019s challenge to the Georgia statute as applied to consensual homosexual sodomy. We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy.\u201d State sodomy laws were seldom enforced against private, consensual conduct in the decades following the decision, though many courts and state governments interpreted it to justify a wide variety of bans and limitations on the lives of [[gay]] people.<ref name=\"keen\">{{cite news |title=Strangers to the Law: Gay People on Trial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keen-law.html |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Lisa Keen |author2=Susanne B. Goldberg}}</ref>\n\n''Bowers'' was used to deny suspect class qualification to gays and lesbians, thus restricting the standard of review to rational basis. Although ''Bowers'' was later overruled, decisions based on it, such as ''[[High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office]]'',<ref>{{cite court |litigants=High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office |vol=895 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=563 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1990 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/895/563/46921/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}</ref> are sometimes still cited as precedent in gay rights cases.\n\n===Justice Powell's later comments===\nIn 1990, three years after retiring from the Court, Powell told a group of [[New York University]] law students that he considered his opinion in ''Bowers'' an error. \u201cI do think it was inconsistent in a general way with ''Roe''. When I had the opportunity to reread the opinions a few months later I thought the dissent had the better of the arguments.\"<ref name = shilts>Shilts, p. 542</ref> But Powell believed the case was one of little importance and in 1990 said he hadn't devoted thirty minutes to thinking about it since the ruling.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price}}\n\n===Repeal of state sodomy laws===\nIn the years after ''Bowers'' was decided, several state legislatures repealed their sodomy laws. In addition, a number of state courts invalidated sodomy laws under privacy or other provisions of their state constitutions. The same sodomy law that was upheld in ''Bowers'' was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court under the Georgia state constitution in the case of ''[[Powell v. Georgia|Powell v. State]]''.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Powell v. State |vol=270 |reporter=Ga. |opinion=327 |pinpoint= |court=Ga. |date=1998 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1338934/powell-v-state/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=\"keen\"/>\n\n====''Lawrence v. Texas''====\nThe remaining 13 state sodomy laws in the U.S. were invalidated, insofar as they applied to private consensual conduct among adults, by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',<ref name=Lawrence/> which explicitly overturned ''Bowers''. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas|Lawrence]]'', ruling that Texas's state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one's home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause). Kennedy wrote: \u201c''Bowers'' was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' should be and now is overruled.\u201d<ref>''Lawrence'', 539 U.S. at 578.</ref>\n\n===Media portrayal===\n[[Bill Moyers]] discussed the decision at length in an interview with Blackmun on the episode \"Mr. Justice Blackmun\" of the 1987 Constitutional bicentennial documentary miniseries ''In Search of the Constitution''.<ref>[https://billmoyers.com/content/mr-justice-blackmun-supreme-court/ Mr. Justice Blackmun (April 16, 1987)]</ref>\n\nIn 2009 a play based on the life of Michael Hardwick and the judicial proceedings, ''Sodomy Rules: The Bowers v.

The Verhulst equation was published after Verhulst had read [[Thomas Malthus]]' ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Verhulst derived his logistic equation to describe the self-limiting growth of a [[biology|biological]] population. The equation was rediscovered in 1911 by [[Anderson Gray McKendrick|A. G.

The value of the rate <math>r</math> represents the proportional increase of the population <math>P</math> in one unit of time. Later, as the population grows, the modulus of the second term (which multiplied out is <math>-r P^2 / K</math>) becomes almost as large as the first, as some members of the population <math>P</math> interfere with each other by competing for some critical resource, such as food or living space. This antagonistic effect is called the ''bottleneck'', and is modeled by the value of the parameter <math>K</math>. The competition diminishes the combined growth rate, until the value of <math>P</math> ceases to grow (this is called ''maturity'' of the population).\nThe solution to the equation (with <math>P_0</math> being the initial population) is\n\n:<math>P(t) = \\frac{K P_0 e^{rt}}{K + P_0 \\left( e^{rt} - 1\\right)} = \\frac{K}{1+\\left(\\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}\\right)e^{-rt}}, </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P(t) = K.</math>\n\nWhich is to say that <math>K</math> is the limiting value of <math>P</math>: the highest value that the population can reach given infinite time (or come close to reaching in finite time).

For example, they are the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[Logistic distribution|logistic family of distributions]], and they are, a bit simplified, used to model the chance a chess player has to beat his opponent in the [[Elo rating system]]. More specific examples now follow.\n\n==== Logistic regression ====\n{{Main|Logistic regression}}\n\nLogistic functions are used in [[logistic regression]] to model how the probability <math>p</math> of an event may be affected by one or more [[explanatory variables]]: an example would be to have the model\n\n: <math>p = f(a + bx),</math>\n\nwhere <math>x</math> is the explanatory variable, <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are model parameters to be fitted, and <math>f</math> is the standard logistic function.\n\nLogistic regression and other [[log-linear model]]s are also commonly used in [[machine learning]]. A generalisation of the logistic function to multiple inputs is the [[softmax activation function]], used in [[multinomial logistic regression]].\n\nAnother application of the logistic function is in the [[Rasch model]], used in [[item response theory]]. In particular, the Rasch model forms a basis for [[maximum likelihood]] estimation of the locations of objects or persons on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], based on collections of categorical data, for example the abilities of persons on a continuum based on responses that have been categorized as correct and incorrect.\n\n==== Neural networks ====\nLogistic functions are often used in [[neural network]]s to introduce [[nonlinearity]] in the model or to clamp signals to within a specified [[interval (mathematics)|interval]].  A popular [[artificial neuron|neural net element]] computes a [[linear combination]] of its input signals, and applies a bounded logistic function to the result; this model can be seen as a \"smoothed\" variant of the classical [[perceptron|threshold neuron]].\n\n<!-- A reason for its popularity in neural networks is because the logistic function satisfies the differential equation\n\n:<math>y' = y(1-y).</math>\n\nThe right hand side is a low-degree polynomial.

In the idealized case of very long therapy, <math>c(t)</math> can be modeled as a periodic function (of period <math>T</math>) or (in case of continuous infusion therapy) as a constant function, and one has that\n\n: <math>\\frac 1 T \\int_0^T c(t)\\, dt > r \\to \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} x(t) = 0,</math>\n\ni.e. if the average therapy-induced death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate, then there is the eradication of the disease. Of course, this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy (e.g. it does not take into account the phenomenon of clonal resistance).\n\n=== In chemistry: reaction models ===\nThe concentration of reactants and products in [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic reactions]] follow the logistic function.\nThe degradation of [[Platinum group|platinum group metal]]-free (PGM-free) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst in fuel cell cathodes follows the logistic decay function,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Xi |last2=Zelenay |first2=Piotr |title=Kinetic Models for the Degradation Mechanisms of PGM-Free ORR Catalysts |journal=ECS Transactions |date=13 July 2018 |volume=85 |issue=13 |pages=1239\u20131250 |doi=10.1149/08513.1239ecst}}</ref> suggesting an autocatalytic degradation mechanism.\n\n=== In physics: Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution ===\nThe logistic function determines the statistical distribution of fermions over the energy states of a system in thermal equilibrium.

In particular, Tarde identifies three main stages through which innovations spread: the first one corresponds to the difficult beginnings, during which the idea has to struggle within a hostile environment full of opposing habits and beliefs; the second one corresponds to the properly exponential take-off of the idea, with <math>f(x)=2^x</math>; finally, the third stage is logarithmic, with <math>f(x)=\\log(x)</math>, and corresponds to the time when the impulse of the idea gradually slows down while, simultaneously new opponent ideas appear. The ensuing situation halts or stabilizes the progress of the innovation, which approaches an asymptote.\n\nIn a [[Sovereign state|sovereign State]], the subnational units ([[Constituent state|constituent states]] or [[City|cities]]) may use loans to finance their projects. However, this funding source is usually subject to strict legal rules as well as to economy [[scarcity]] constraints, specially the resources the banks can lend (due to their [[Equity (finance)|equity]] or [[Basel III|Basel]] limits). These restrictions, which represent a saturation level, along with an exponential rush in an [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]] for money, create a [[public finance]] diffusion of credit pleas and the aggregate national response is a [[sigmoid curve]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rocha|first=Leno S.|last2=Rocha|first2=Frederico S.

This leads to a period of rapid industry growth. Some of the more famous examples are: railroads, incandescent light bulbs, [[electrification]], [[car]]s and air travel. Eventually, dramatic improvement and cost reduction opportunities are exhausted, the product or process are in widespread use with few remaining potential new customers, and markets become saturated.\n\nLogistic analysis was used in papers by several researchers at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis ([[IIASA]]). These papers deal with the diffusion of various innovations, infrastructures and energy source substitutions and the role of work in the economy as well as with the long economic cycle.

This yields an unstable equilibrium at 0 and a stable equilibrium at 1, and thus for any function value greater than 0 and less than 1, it grows to 1.\n\n<!-- The above equation can be rewritten in the following steps:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f(x)(1-f(x)) </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = y(1-y) </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = y - y^2 </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} - y = -y^2 </math> trivial algebraic manipulation-->\nThe logistic equation is a special case of the [[Bernoulli differential equation]] and has the following solution:\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{e^x + C}.</math>\n\nChoosing the constant of integration <math>C = 1</math> gives the other well known form of the definition of the logistic curve:\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}.</math>\n\nMore quantitatively, as can be seen from the analytical solution, the logistic curve shows early [[exponential growth]] for negative argument, which slows to linear growth of slope 1/4 for an argument near 0, then approaches 1 with an exponentially decaying gap.\n\nThe logistic function is the inverse of the natural [[logit]] function and so can be used to convert the logarithm of [[odds]] into a [[probability]]. In mathematical notation the logistic function is sometimes written as ''expit''<ref>[http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/clusterPower/docs/expit expit documentation for R's clusterPower package].</ref> in the same form as ''logit''. The conversion from the [[log-likelihood ratio]] of two alternatives also takes the form of a logistic curve.\n\nThe differential equation derived above is a special case of a general differential equation that only models the sigmoid function for <math>x > 0</math>.

The Verhulst equation was published after Verhulst had read [[Thomas Malthus]]' ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Verhulst derived his logistic equation to describe the self-limiting growth of a [[biology|biological]] population. The equation was rediscovered in 1911 by [[Anderson Gray McKendrick|A. G. McKendrick]] for the growth of bacteria in broth and experimentally tested using a technique for nonlinear parameter estimation.<ref name=\"McKendric Logistic\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0370164600025426|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume= 31 |date= January 1912|pages= 649\u2013653 |title=XLV.\u2014The Rate of Multiplication of Micro-organisms: A Mathematical Study|author= A.

Lotka]] derived the equation again in 1925, calling it the ''law of population growth''.\n\nLetting <math>P</math> represent population size (<math>N</math> is often used in ecology instead) and <math>t</math> represent time, this model is formalized by the [[differential equation]]:\n\n: <math>\\frac{dP}{dt}=r P \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere the constant <math>r</math> defines the [[population growth rate|growth rate]] and <math>K</math> is the [[carrying capacity]].\n\nIn the equation, the early, unimpeded growth rate is modeled by the first term <math>+rP</math>. The value of the rate <math>r</math> represents the proportional increase of the population <math>P</math> in one unit of time. Later, as the population grows, the modulus of the second term (which multiplied out is <math>-r P^2 / K</math>) becomes almost as large as the first, as some members of the population <math>P</math> interfere with each other by competing for some critical resource, such as food or living space. This antagonistic effect is called the ''bottleneck'', and is modeled by the value of the parameter <math>K</math>. The competition diminishes the combined growth rate, until the value of <math>P</math> ceases to grow (this is called ''maturity'' of the population).\nThe solution to the equation (with <math>P_0</math> being the initial population) is\n\n:<math>P(t) = \\frac{K P_0 e^{rt}}{K + P_0 \\left( e^{rt} - 1\\right)} = \\frac{K}{1+\\left(\\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}\\right)e^{-rt}}, </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P(t) = K.</math>\n\nWhich is to say that <math>K</math> is the limiting value of <math>P</math>: the highest value that the population can reach given infinite time (or come close to reaching in finite time). It is important to stress that the carrying capacity is asymptotically reached independently of the initial value <math>P(0) > 0</math>, and also in the case that <math>P(0) > K</math>.\n\nIn [[ecology]], [[species]] are sometimes referred to as [[r/K selection theory|<math>r</math>-strategist or <math>K</math>-strategist]] depending upon the [[Natural selection|selective]] processes that have shaped their [[Biological life cycle|life history]] strategies.\n[[Dimensional analysis|Choosing the variable dimensions]] so that <math>n</math> measures the population in units of carrying capacity, and <math>\\tau</math> measures time in units of <math>1/r</math>, gives the dimensionless\ndifferential equation\n\n: <math>\\frac{dn}{d\\tau} =  n (1-n).</math>\n\n==== Time-varying carrying capacity ====\nSince the environmental conditions influence the carrying capacity, as a consequence it can be time-varying, with <math>K(t) > 0</math>, leading to the following mathematical model:\n\n: <math>\\frac{dP}{dt} = rP \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K(t)}\\right).</math>\n\nA particularly important case is that of carrying capacity that varies periodically with period <math>T</math>:\n\n: <math>K(t + T) = K(t).</math>\n\nIt can be shown{{cn|date=March 2020}} that in such a case, independently from the initial value <math>P(0) > 0</math>, <math>P(t)</math> will tend to a unique periodic solution <math>P_*(t)</math>, whose period is <math>T</math>.\n\nA typical value of <math>T</math> is one year: In such case <math>K(t)</math> may reflect periodical variations of weather conditions.\n\nAnother interesting generalization is to consider that the carrying capacity <math>K(t)</math> is a function of the population at an earlier time, capturing a delay in the way population modifies its environment. This leads to a logistic delay equation,<ref name=\"delay carrying\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yukalov | first1 = V. I. | last2 = Yukalova | first2 = E.

For example, they are the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[Logistic distribution|logistic family of distributions]], and they are, a bit simplified, used to model the chance a chess player has to beat his opponent in the [[Elo rating system]]. More specific examples now follow.\n\n==== Logistic regression ====\n{{Main|Logistic regression}}\n\nLogistic functions are used in [[logistic regression]] to model how the probability <math>p</math> of an event may be affected by one or more [[explanatory variables]]: an example would be to have the model\n\n: <math>p = f(a + bx),</math>\n\nwhere <math>x</math> is the explanatory variable, <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are model parameters to be fitted, and <math>f</math> is the standard logistic function.\n\nLogistic regression and other [[log-linear model]]s are also commonly used in [[machine learning]]. A generalisation of the logistic function to multiple inputs is the [[softmax activation function]], used in [[multinomial logistic regression]].\n\nAnother application of the logistic function is in the [[Rasch model]], used in [[item response theory]]. In particular, the Rasch model forms a basis for [[maximum likelihood]] estimation of the locations of objects or persons on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], based on collections of categorical data, for example the abilities of persons on a continuum based on responses that have been categorized as correct and incorrect.\n\n==== Neural networks ====\nLogistic functions are often used in [[neural network]]s to introduce [[nonlinearity]] in the model or to clamp signals to within a specified [[interval (mathematics)|interval]].  A popular [[artificial neuron|neural net element]] computes a [[linear combination]] of its input signals, and applies a bounded logistic function to the result; this model can be seen as a \"smoothed\" variant of the classical [[perceptron|threshold neuron]].\n\n<!-- A reason for its popularity in neural networks is because the logistic function satisfies the differential equation\n\n:<math>y' = y(1-y).</math>\n\nThe right hand side is a low-degree polynomial.

This application can be considered an extension of the above-mentioned use in the framework of ecology (see also the [[Generalized logistic curve]], allowing for more parameters). Denoting with <math>X(t)</math> the size of the tumor at time <math>t</math>, its dynamics are governed by\n\n: <math>X' = r\\left(1 - \\frac X K \\right)X,</math>\n\nwhich is of the type\n\n: <math>X' = F(X)X, \\quad F'(X) \\le 0,</math>\n\nwhere <math>F(X)</math> is the proliferation rate of the tumor.\n\nIf a chemotherapy is started with a log-kill effect, the equation may be revised to be\n\n: <math>X' = r\\left(1 - \\frac X K \\right)X - c(t) X,</math>\n\nwhere <math>c(t)</math> is the therapy-induced death rate. In the idealized case of very long therapy, <math>c(t)</math> can be modeled as a periodic function (of period <math>T</math>) or (in case of continuous infusion therapy) as a constant function, and one has that\n\n: <math>\\frac 1 T \\int_0^T c(t)\\, dt > r \\to \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} x(t) = 0,</math>\n\ni.e. if the average therapy-induced death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate, then there is the eradication of the disease. Of course, this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy (e.g. it does not take into account the phenomenon of clonal resistance).\n\n=== In chemistry: reaction models ===\nThe concentration of reactants and products in [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic reactions]] follow the logistic function.\nThe degradation of [[Platinum group|platinum group metal]]-free (PGM-free) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst in fuel cell cathodes follows the logistic decay function,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Xi |last2=Zelenay |first2=Piotr |title=Kinetic Models for the Degradation Mechanisms of PGM-Free ORR Catalysts |journal=ECS Transactions |date=13 July 2018 |volume=85 |issue=13 |pages=1239\u20131250 |doi=10.1149/08513.1239ecst}}</ref> suggesting an autocatalytic degradation mechanism.\n\n=== In physics: Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution ===\nThe logistic function determines the statistical distribution of fermions over the energy states of a system in thermal equilibrium. In particular, it is the distribution of the probabilities that each possible energy level is occupied by a fermion, according to [[Fermi function|Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]].\n\n=== In material science: Phase diagrams ===\n[[Diffusion bonding]].\n\n=== In linguistics: language change ===\nIn linguistics, the logistic function can be used to model [[language change]]:<ref name=\"probabilistic linguistics\">Bod, Hay, Jennedy (eds.) 2003, pp. 147\u2013156</ref> an innovation that is at first marginal begins to spread more quickly with time, and then more slowly as it becomes more universally adopted.\n\n=== In agriculture: modeling crop response ===\nThe logistic S-curve can be used for modeling the crop response to changes in growth factors. There are two types of response functions:  ''positive''  and ''negative'' growth curves. For example, the crop yield may ''increase'' with increasing value of the growth factor up to a certain level (positive function), or it may ''decrease'' with increasing growth factor values (negative function owing to a negative growth factor), which situation requires an ''inverted'' S-curve.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|The logistic S-curve can be used to model the relation between crop yield and depth of the '''[[water table]]''' in the soil.<ref name=\"calc\">Calculator for crop response to changes in growth factors using [[segmented regression]], S-curves and [[parabola]]s.

In particular, Tarde identifies three main stages through which innovations spread: the first one corresponds to the difficult beginnings, during which the idea has to struggle within a hostile environment full of opposing habits and beliefs; the second one corresponds to the properly exponential take-off of the idea, with <math>f(x)=2^x</math>; finally, the third stage is logarithmic, with <math>f(x)=\\log(x)</math>, and corresponds to the time when the impulse of the idea gradually slows down while, simultaneously new opponent ideas appear. The ensuing situation halts or stabilizes the progress of the innovation, which approaches an asymptote.\n\nIn a [[Sovereign state|sovereign State]], the subnational units ([[Constituent state|constituent states]] or [[City|cities]]) may use loans to finance their projects. However, this funding source is usually subject to strict legal rules as well as to economy [[scarcity]] constraints, specially the resources the banks can lend (due to their [[Equity (finance)|equity]] or [[Basel III|Basel]] limits). These restrictions, which represent a saturation level, along with an exponential rush in an [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]] for money, create a [[public finance]] dynamic diffusion of credit pleas and the aggregate response is [[sigmoid curve]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rocha|first=Leno S.|last2=Rocha|first2=Frederico S.

This leads to a period of rapid industry growth. Some of the more famous examples are: railroads, incandescent light bulbs, [[electrification]], [[car]]s and air travel. Eventually, dramatic improvement and cost reduction opportunities are exhausted, the product or process are in widespread use with few remaining potential new customers, and markets become saturated.\n\nLogistic analysis was used in papers by several researchers at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis ([[IIASA]]).
