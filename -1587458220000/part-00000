The borough was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1207 by King John, was made up of only seven streets in the shape of the letter 'H' but Liverpool remained a small settlement until its trade with [[Ireland]] and coastal parts of England and Wales was overtaken by trade with [[Africa]] and the [[West Indies]], which included the [[slave trade]].  The world's first [[wet dock]] was opened in 1715 and Liverpool's expansion to become a major city continued over the next two centuries.\n\nBy the start of the nineteenth century, a large volume of trade was passing through [[Liverpool]]. In 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened. The population grew rapidly, especially with [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants; by 1851, one quarter of the city's population was Irish-born.  As growth continued, the city became known as \"the second city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\", and was also called \"the [[New York City|New York]] of Europe\".  During the Second World War, the city was the centre for planning the crucial [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and suffered a [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz]] second only to London's.\n\nFrom the mid-twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and traditional [[manufacturing industries]] went into sharp decline, with the advent of [[containerisation]] making the city's docks obsolete.  The [[unemployment rate]] in Liverpool rose to one of the highest in the UK. Over the same period, starting in the early 1960s, the city became internationally renowned for its culture, particularly as the centre of the \"[[Merseybeat]]\" sound which became synonymous with [[The Beatles]]. In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered, partly due to tourism as well as substantial investment in [[Urban regeneration|regeneration]] schemes.  The city was the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008.\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe name comes from the Old English ''liver'',my mum and i have a liver meaning thick or muddy, and ''pol'', meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as ''Liuerpul''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, David|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=the University Press|isbn=0198605617|page=1110}}</ref><ref name=DH>{{cite web|title=Liverpool|publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Liverpool|last=Harper|first=Douglas}}</ref> According to the ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".<ref name=DH/> The adjective ''Liverpudlian'' is first recorded in 1833.<ref name=DH/>\n\n==Early history of the area==\n[[File:The Calder Stones, Calderstones Park - geograph.org.uk - 40880.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ancient neolithic Calder Stones on display in the Harthill Greenhouses]]\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the area around modern-day Liverpool was sparsely populated, though there was a seaport at [[Meols]]. The [[Calderstones Park|Calderstones]] are thought to be part of an ancient [[stone circle]] and there is archaeological evidence for native Iron Age farmsteads at several sites in [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]], [[Halewood]] and [[Lathom]]. The region was inhabited by [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] tribes, the [[Setantii]] as well as nearby [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] and [[Deceangli]]. It came under Roman influence in about 70 AD, with the northward advance to crush the [[druid]] resistance at [[Anglesey]] and to end the internal strife between the ruling family of [[Brigantes]]. The main Roman presence was at the fortress and settlement at [[Chester]]. According to [[Ptolemy]], the Latin hydronym for the [[Mersey]] was ''Seteia Aestuarium'', which derives from the Setantii tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/livingwithromans/ancestors.aspx|work=Museum of Liverpool|title=Our ancestors and the Roman invasion|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainCornovii.htm|work=The History Files|title=Celtic kingdoms of the British Isles|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, evidence of a Roman Tile works was found around the [[Tarbock]] Island area of the M62 and various Roman coins and Jewellery have been found in the Liverpool area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/roman-liverpool/|title=Roman Liverpool|website=History of Liverpool|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Roman troops, land in the area continued to be farmed by native [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]]. The [[Hen Ogledd]] (Old North) was subject to fighting between four medieval kingdoms: the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of Mercia]] eventually defeated its rival [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] as well as the Celtic kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], with the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] perhaps taking place at nearby [[Bromborough]]. The settlements at [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] (''Wealas tun'' meaning 'farmstead of the [[Walhaz|Wealas]]'), and [[Wallasey]] (''Wealas-eg'' meaning 'island of the Wealas') were named at this time with ''Wealas'' being [[Old English]] for 'foreigner' referring to the native [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Romano-British culture|Romanized inhabitants]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Eilert|last=Ekwall|authorlink=Eilert Ekwall|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names|publisher=OUP|year=1936}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Wales|title=Wales|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe pseudo-historical ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' appears to record the Norse settlement of the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] in its account of the immigration of [[Ingimundr (tenth century)|Ingimundr]] near Chester.

Ferguson Irvine's conjectural plan of Liverpool's original 7 streets]]\n[[File:Westderbycastle.gif|alt=West Derby Castle shown where it used to stand.|thumb|West Derby Castle shown where it used to stand. (circa 1200)]]\nAlthough a small [[motte and bailey]] castle had earlier been built by the Normans at [[West Derby]], the origins of the city of Liverpool are usually dated from 28 August 1207, when [[letters patent]] were issued by [[John of England|King John]] advertising the establishment of a new borough, \"Livpul\", and inviting settlers to come and take up holdings there. It is thought that the King wanted a port in the district that was free from the control of the [[Earl of Chester]]. Initially it served as a dispatch point for troops sent to Ireland, soon after the building around 1235 of [[Liverpool Castle]], which was removed in 1726. [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] was built by 1257, originally as a chapel within the parish of [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton-on-the-Hill]].<ref name=Belchem>{{cite book|editor-first=John|editor-last=Belchem|title=Liverpool 800: Culture, Character & History|year=2006|isbn=1-84631-035-0}}</ref> In the 13th Century, Liverpool as an area comprised just seven streets.\n\nWith the formation of a market on the site of the later Town Hall, Liverpool became established as a small fishing and farming community, administered by [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] and, slightly later, a mayor. There was probably some coastal trade around the [[Irish Sea]], and there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. However, for several centuries it remained a small and relatively unimportant settlement, with a population of no more than 1,000 in the mid 14th century. By the early fifteenth century a period of economic decline set in, and the county gentry increased their power over the town, the [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|Stanley]] family fortifying their house by building Stanley Tower on Water Street. This was a catalyst for a feud between the Stanley and [[Earl of Sefton|Molyneux]] families since the Molyneux family had permission to live at the nearby [[Liverpool Castle]] at that time. The resulting rivalry nearly spilled into a riot in 1424.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-molyneux-stanley-family-history/|title=Text only version of our interactive Liverpool Molyneux Stanley family history page.|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> In the middle of the 16th century the population of Liverpool had fallen to around 600, and the port was regarded as subordinate to [[Chester, England|Chester]] until the 1650s.\n\n==Elizabethan era and the Civil War==\n[[File:Liverpool.1572.jpg|thumb|Liverpool in 1572.]]\nIn 1571 the people of Liverpool sent a memorial to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], praying relief from a subsidy which they thought themselves unable to bear, wherein they styled themselves \"''her majesty's poor decayed town of Liverpool.''\" Some time towards the close of this reign, [[Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby]], on his way to the [[Isle of Man]], stayed at his house, the Tower; at which the corporation erected a handsome hall or seat for him in the church, where he honoured them several times with his presence.\n\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, the town began to be able to take advantage of economic revival and the silting of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] to win trade, mainly from Chester, to Ireland, the Isle of Man and elsewhere. In 1626, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] gave the town a new and improved charter.<ref name=Belchem />\n[[File:Liverpool.1650.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Liverpool in 1650.]]\n\nIn June 1644 [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] arrived in Liverpool with 10,000 men in an attempt to capture [[Liverpool Castle]]. A sixteen-day siege of Liverpool then took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|title=Civil War Siege of Liverpool|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403112400/http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|archive-date=3 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> To defend the city the [[New Model Army|Parliament Army]] created a huge trench across much of the town centre. Prince Rupert eventually took hold of the Castle only to be driven out again to take refuge in the Everton area of the city, hence the name of the tower found on the modern day Everton Football Club badge is known as [[Everton Lock-Up|Prince Rupert's Tower]].\n\n==Transatlantic trade==\nThe first cargo from the Americas was recorded in 1648. The development of the town accelerated after the Restoration of 1660, with the growth of trade with America and the [[West Indies]]. From that time may be traced the rapid progress of population and commerce, until Liverpool had become the second metropolis of Great Britain. Initially, cloth, coal and salt from Lancashire and Cheshire were exchanged for sugar and tobacco; the town's first sugar refinery was established in 1667.<ref>http://www.mawer.clara.net/loc-liverpool.html</ref>\n\nIn 1699 Liverpool was made a [[parish]] on its own by [[Act of Parliament]], separate from that of Walton-on-the-Hill, with two parish churches. At the same time it gained separate customs authority from Chester.<ref name=\"Belchem\" />\n\n==Slavery==\nOn 3 October 1699, the very same year that Liverpool had been granted status as an independent parish, Liverpool's first 'recorded' [[slave ship]], named ''Liverpool Merchant'', set sail for Africa, arriving in Barbados with a 'cargo' of 220 Africans, returning to Liverpool on 18 September 1700. The following month a second recorded ship, ''The Blessing'', set sail for the Gold Coast.\n\nThe first commercial [[wet dock]] in Britain was built in Liverpool and completed in 1715. It was the first in the world and was constructed for a capacity of 100 ships. By the close of the 18th century 40% of the world's, and 80% of Britain's Atlantic slave activity was accounted for by slave ships that voyaged from the [[:Category:Liverpool docks|docks at Liverpool]]. This growth led to the opening of the [[Consulate of the United States in Liverpool]] in 1790, its first consulate anywhere in the world.\n\nVast profits from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] transformed Liverpool into one of Britain's foremost important cities. Liverpool became a financial centre, rivalled by Bristol, another slaving port, and beaten only by London. In the peak year of 1799, ships sailing from Liverpool carried over 45,000 slaves from Africa.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nMany factors led to the demise of slavery including revolts, piracy, social unrest, and the repercussions of corruption such as slave insurance fraud, e.g. the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]] case in 1783. It was Liverpool born politician [[William Roscoe]] who spearheaded the anti-Slavery movement in parliament at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Liverpool Slave Trade |publisher=History of Liverpool |url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-slave-trade/ |accessdate=28  February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSlavery in British colonies was finally abolished in 1833 and slave trading was made illegal in 1807 though some slavery apprenticeships ran until 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/journey/american_connection/slavery/timeline.shtml|work=BBC|title=Liverpool Local History - American Connections - Slavery Timeline|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> However, many merchants managed to ignore the laws and continued to deal in underground slave trafficking, also underhandedly engaging in financial investments for slaving activities in the Americas.\n\n==Industrial revolution and commercial expansion==\n{{Gallery\n| title        = 19th Century Liverpool\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       =\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Cunard Line New York Liverpool 1875.jpg\n | alt1= [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n | [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n|File:George's Dock 1897.jpg\n|alt2=[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|File:Seaforth Sands railway station 1.jpg\n|alt3=[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]]\n|[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] [[Seaforth Sands railway station]] opened 1894, railway opened 1893, photo 1951\n|File:White Star Offices, Liverpool.jpg\n|alt4=[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|File:Roscoe GJR(1839) p155 - Entrance to the Railway Station at Liverpool.jpg\n|alt5=[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|File:Liverpool1890s.jpg\n|alt6=Colourised photo taken in the 1890s.

Liverpool was first linked by canal to Manchester in 1721, the [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] coalfield in 1755, and Leeds in 1816. In 1830, Liverpool became home to the world's first inter-urban rail link to another city, [[Manchester]], through the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the maiden journey Stephenson's [[Stephenson's Rocket|The Rocket]] train.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-railways/ |title = KS3 History Railways|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]], which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].\n\nThe built-up area grew rapidly from the eighteenth century on. The [[Liverpool Blue Coat School|Bluecoat Hospital]] for poor children opened in 1718. With the demolition of the castle in 1726, only [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] and the historic street plan - with Castle Street as the spine of the original settlement, and [[Paradise Street, Liverpool|Paradise Street]] following the line of the Pool - remained to reflect the town's mediaeval origins. The Town Hall, with a covered exchange for merchants designed by architect [[John Wood, the Elder|John Wood]], was built in 1754, and the first office buildings including the Corn Exchange were opened in about 1810.\n\nThroughout the 19th century Liverpool's trade and its population continued to expanded rapidly. Growth in the cotton trade was accompanied by the development of strong trading links with India and the Far East following the ending of the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company's]] monopoly in 1813. Over {{convert|140|acre|km2}} of new docks, with {{convert|10|mi|km}} of quay space, were opened between 1824 and 1858.<ref name=Belchem />\n\n[[File:Situationsplan von Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Map of Liverpool from 1880]]\nDuring the 1840s, [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants began arriving by the thousands due to the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Famine]] of 1845\u20131849. Almost 300,000 arrived in the year 1847 alone, and by 1851 approximately 25% of the city was Irish-born. The Irish influence is reflected in the unique place Liverpool occupies in UK and Irish political history, being the only place outside Ireland to elect a member of parliament from the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] to the British parliament in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]. [[T.P. O'Connor]] represented the constituency of [[Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Scotland]] from 1885 to 1929.\n\nAs the town became a leading port of the [[British Empire]], a number of major buildings were constructed, including [[St. George\u2019s Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]] (1854), and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street Station]]. The [[Grand National]] steeplechase was first run at Aintree in 1837.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-victorian-times/|title=KS3 History Victorian Times|work=History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126062459/http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-victorian-times/|archive-date=26 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1851 and 1911, Liverpool attracted at least 20,000 people from Wales in each decade, peaking in the 1880s, and Welsh culture flourished.  One of the first Welsh language journals, ''Yr Amserau'', was founded in Liverpool by [[William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog)]], and there were over 50 Welsh chapels in the city.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Davies|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=A History of Wales|year=1993|isbn=0-14-028475-3}}</ref>\n\nEarly regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as [[Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet)]] and [[Collins Line]] and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines [[Cunard Line]] and [[White Star Line]] continuing throughout the 19th Century.\n\nWhen the [[American Civil War]] broke out Liverpool became a hotbed of intrigue. The prevalence of cotton and slave interests in Liverpool ensured that the city was, in the words of the historian [[Sven Beckert]], \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Navy ship, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], was built at [[Birkenhead]] on the Mersey and the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] surrendered there (being the final surrender and end of the war).\n\nLiverpool was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1880, and the following year its [[Liverpool University|university]] was established.

However, it was changed to depart from [[Southampton]] instead.\n\nAside from the large [[Irish people|Irish]] community in Liverpool, there were other pockets of cultural diversity. The area of Gerard, Hunter, Lionel and Whale streets, off [[Scotland Road]], was referred to as ''Little Italy''. Inspired by an old [[Venice|Venetian]] custom, Liverpool was 'married to the sea' in September 1928. Liverpool was also home to a large Welsh population, and was sometimes referred to as the Capital of North Wales. In 1884, 1900 and 1929, [[Eisteddfod]]s were held in Liverpool. The population of the city peaked at over 850,000 in the 1930s.\n\nEconomic changes began in the first part of the 20th century, as falls in world demand for the North West's traditional export commodities contributed to stagnation and decline in the city. Unemployment was well above the national average as early as the 1920s, and the city became known nationally for its occasionally violent religious [[sectarianism]].<ref name=Belchem />\n\nWhen [[Everton F.C.]] won the [[Football League First Division]] title in 1928, their centre-forward [[Dixie Dean]] scored a [[Football League]] record of 60 goals in the same season.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] hit Liverpool badly in the early 1930s with thousands of people in the city left unemployed. This was combated by a large amount of housing mostly built by the local council being constructed, creating jobs mostly in the building, plumbing and electrical trades. About 15 per cent of the city's population were rehoused in the 1920s and 1930s with more than 30,000 new council houses being built to replace the slums in the city.\n\nThe rising popularity of motor cars led to congestion in the city, and in 1934 the city gained its first direct road link with the [[Wirral Peninsula]], when the first [[Mersey Tunnel]] road was opened. The Queensway, as the new tunnel was named, linked Liverpool with [[Birkenhead]] at the other side of the Mersey. Many other buildings were built in the city in the 1930s to ease the depression and became local landmarks, with many buildings featuring American inspired architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|title=Creativity in the Great Depression|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627093143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1939-1945: World War II===\n{{main|Liverpool Blitz}}\nDuring World War 2, Liverpool was the control centre for the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. There were eighty [[Liverpool Blitz|air-raids on Merseyside]], with an especially concentrated series of raids in May 1941 which interrupted operations at the docks for almost a week. Some 2,500 people were killed,<ref>Some sources state 4,000</ref> almost half the homes in the metropolitan area sustained some damage and some 11,000 were totally destroyed. Over 70,000 people were made homeless.<ref name=Belchem /> [[John Lennon]], one of the founding members of [[The Beatles]], was born in Liverpool during an air-raid on 9 October 1940. All four members of The Beatles were born in the city during the war, rising to fame in the early 1960s.\n\n===1946-1979===\n[[File:Capel Celyn exposed tree stumps.jpg|right|thumb|Tree stumps exposed by low water level of reservoir, at [[Capel Celyn]], a Welsh village flooded to provide water for Liverpool.]]\n\nSignificant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the [[Seaforth Dock]], the largest dock project in Britain. However, the city has been suffering since the 1950s with the loss of numerous employers. By 1985 the population had fallen to 460,000. Declines in manufacturing and dock activity struck the city particularly hard. In 1956 [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] and its fourteen stations were closed and demolished and in 1957 [[Liverpool Corporation Tramways]] closed after the last tram ran in Liverpool.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led locally by Jack and [[Bessie Braddock]], came to power in the City Council for the first time.\n\nIn 1956, a [[private bill]] sponsored by [[Liverpool City Council]] was brought before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to develop a water reservoir from the [[Afon Tryweryn|Tryweryn Valley]]. The development would include the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]]. By obtaining authority via an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council would not require planning consent from the relevant Welsh Local Authorities. This, together with the fact that the village was one of the last Welsh-only speaking communities, ensured that the proposals became deeply controversial. Thirty five out of thirty six Welsh [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) opposed the bill (the other did not vote), but in 1957 it was passed. The members of the community waged an eight-year effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to prevent the destruction of their homes, which finally occurred in 1965. The incident led to a massive rise in [[Welsh nationalism]], and a year later, [[Gwynfor Evans]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] won the party's first seat in the [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|Carmathen by-election]].\n\nIn the 1960s Liverpool became a centre of [[youth culture]]. The city produced the distinctive [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] sound, most famously [[The Beatles]], and the [[Liverpool poets]].\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into further sharp decline. The advent of [[containerisation]] meant that Liverpool's docks ceased to be a major local employer. [[Liverpool Central High Level railway station]] closed in 1972, as well as the [[Waterloo Tunnel|Waterloo]], [[Victoria Tunnel (Liverpool)|Victoria]] and [[Wapping Tunnel|Wapping]] tunnels. In 1974, Liverpool became a [[metropolitan district]] within the newly created [[metropolitan county]] of [[Merseyside]]. In 1977 [[Liverpool Exchange railway station]] closed, and in 1979 the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] closed too. In 1972 [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific]] unit [[CP Ships]] were the last transatlantic line to operate from Liverpool.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw Liverpool's fortunes sink to their lowest postwar point. Although the 1970s, along with the rest of Britain, had brought economic difficulties and a steady rise in unemployment, the situation in Liverpool went from bad to worse in the early 1980s, with endless factory closures and some of the highest unemployment rates in the UK. An average of 12,000 people each year were leaving the city, and 15% of its land was vacant or derelict.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nIn July 1981 the infamous [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth Riots]] took place, during which, for the first time in the UK outside [[Northern Ireland]], [[tear gas]] was used by police against civilians. In the same year, the [[Tate and Lyle]] sugar works, previously a mainstay of the city's manufacturing economy, closed down. The docks had already declined dramatically by this stage, depriving the city of another major source of employment.\n\nBy 1985, unemployment in Liverpool exceeded 20%, around double the national average. About this time the scourge of heroin, always present in port cities, began to rise.\n\n[[Liverpool City Council]] was dominated by the far-left wing [[Militant tendency|Militant]] group during the 1980s, under the ''de facto'' leadership of [[Derek Hatton]] (although Hatton was formally only Deputy Leader). The city council sank heavily into debt, as the City Council fought a campaign to prevent central government from reducing funding for local services. Ultimately this led to 49 of the City's Councillors being removed from office by the District Auditor for refusing to cut the budget, refusing to make good the deficit and forcing the City Council into virtual bankruptcy. The conduct of Hatton and the militant tendency had even come under the scrutiny of Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]], who was keen to remove the militant tendency from the party as part of the attempt to make it electable again. At the same time, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] was deeply unpopular in Liverpool, with the Conservatives share of the vote in most local council and parliamentary elections being consistently low throughout the 1980s.\n\nOn 15 April 1989, 96 [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans (mostly from [[Merseyside]] as well as neighbouring parts of [[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]) were fatally injured in the [[Hillsborough disaster]] at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final in [[Sheffield]]. This had a traumatic effect on people across the country, particularly in and around the city of Liverpool, and resulted in legally imposed changes in the way in which football fans have since been accommodated, including compulsory all-seater stadiums at all leading English clubs by the mid 1990s. Many clubs removed their perimeter fencing almost immediately after the tragedy, and such measures at football grounds in England have long since been banned.\n\nIn particular this led to strong feeling in Liverpool because it was widely reported in the media that the Liverpool fans were at fault. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' sparked particular controversy for publishing these allegations in an article four days after the disaster. Sales of the newspaper in Liverpool slumped and many newsagents refused to stock it. Three decades later, many people in the city still refuse to buy ''The Sun'' and a number of newsagents still refuse to sell it. Other media outlets including the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also printed similar stories in which the behaviour of Liverpool fans was alleged to have been a major factor in the tragedy.\n\nThere was further controversy surrounding the tragedy in March 1991 when a verdict of accidental death was recorded on the 95 people who had died at Hillsborough (the 96th victim did not die until 1993), much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing, or an open verdict, to be recorded; and for criminal charges to be brought against South Yorkshire Police. This verdict was eventually replaced by one of unlawful killing at fresh inquest 25 years later.\n\nIt has since become clear that [[South Yorkshire Police]] made a range of mistakes at the game, though the senior officer in charge of the event retired soon after.\n\nThe success of Liverpool FC was some compensation for the city's economic misfortune during the 1970s and 1980s. The club, formed in 1892, had won five league titles by 1947, but enjoyed its first consistent run of success under the management of [[Bill Shankly]] between 1959 and 1974, winning a further three league titles as well as the club's first two [[FA Cup]]s and its first European trophy in the shape of the [[UEFA Cup]]. Following Shankly's retirement, the club continued to dominate English football for nearly 20 years afterwards. By 1990, Liverpool FC had won more major trophies than any other English club - a total of 18 top division league titles, four FA Cups, four [[Football League Cup]]s, four [[European Cup]]s and two UEFA Cups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisanfield.com/clubinfo/honours/|title=Liverpool FC Honours List|work=This is Anfield|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> The club's iconic red shirt had been worn by some of the biggest names in British sport of the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Kevin Keegan]], [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who also served as manager from 1985 to 1991 and again from 2011 to 2012), [[Phil Neal]], [[Ian Rush]], [[Ian Callaghan]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. The club has yet to win another league title since, although it has since won a further three FA Cups, three League Cups, a UEFA Cup and two European Cups, and fielded a new wave of stars including [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Steven Gerrard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/officiallfc/liverpool-legends/|title=Liverpool Legends|work=Pinterest|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Everton F.C.]], the city's other senior football club, also enjoyed a degree of success during the 1970s and 1980s. The club had enjoyed a consistent run of success during the interwar years and again in the 1960s, but after winning the league title in 1970 went 14 years without winning a major trophy, although they did hold onto the First Division place which had been theirs since 1954. Then, in 1984, Everton won the [[FA Cup]] under the management of [[Howard Kendall]], who had once been a player at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|title=1981 - 2002|work=Everton F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130142508/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|archivedate=30 January 2013}}</ref> A league title win followed in 1985, along with the club's first European trophy - the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html?tab=1|title=1981 - 2002|work=Everton F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124160812/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html?tab=1|archivedate=24 January 2012}}</ref> By 1986, the city's two clubs were firmly established as the leading club sides in England as Liverpool finished league champions and Everton runners-up, and the two sides also met for the FA Cup final, which Liverpool won 3\u20131.

The two boys were found guilty of murder later in the year and sentenced to indefinite detention.\n\nThe 1990s saw the continued regeneration of the city which had started in the 1980s. This still happens in 2020\n\n==Recent history==\nA general economic and civic revival has been underway since the mid-nineties. Liverpool's economy has grown faster than the national average and its crime levels have remained lower than most other metropolitan areas in England and Wales, with recorded crime per head in Merseyside comparable to the national average \u2014 unusually low for an urban area.\n\nIn recent years, the city has emphasised its cultural attractions. Tourism has become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy, capitalising on the popularity of The Beatles and other groups of the Merseybeat era. In June 2003, Liverpool won the right to be named [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008, beating other British cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Birmingham]] to the coveted title. The riverfront of the city was also designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, Liverpool City Council passed a public apology for the flooding [[Capel Celyn]] in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/10/17/feature_welsh_reservoir_feature.shtml|title=Where I Live:Liverpool - Flooding Apology|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC Online|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>   The full statement reads -\n{{cquote|''The Council acknowledges its debt to the many thousands of Welsh people who have made their homes in the City.

The borough was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1207 by King John, was made up of only seven streets in the shape of the letter 'H' but Liverpool remained a small settlement until its trade with [[Ireland]] and coastal parts of England and Wales was overtaken by trade with [[Africa]] and the [[West Indies]], which included the [[slave trade]].  The world's first [[wet dock]] was opened in 1715 and Liverpool's expansion to become a major city continued over the next two centuries.\n\nBy the start of the nineteenth century, a large volume of trade was passing through [[Liverpool]]. In 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened. The population grew rapidly, especially with [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants; by 1851, one quarter of the city's population was Irish-born.  As growth continued, the city became known as \"the second city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\", and was also called \"the [[New York City|New York]] of Europe\".  During the Second World War, the city was the centre for planning the crucial [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and suffered a [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz]] second only to London's.\n\nFrom the mid-twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and traditional [[manufacturing industries]] went into sharp decline, with the advent of [[containerisation]] making the city's docks obsolete.  The [[unemployment rate]] in Liverpool rose to one of the highest in the UK. Over the same period, starting in the early 1960s, the city became internationally renowned for its culture, particularly as the centre of the \"[[Merseybeat]]\" sound which became synonymous with [[The Beatles]]. In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered, partly due to tourism as well as substantial investment in [[Urban regeneration|regeneration]] schemes.  The city was the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008.\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe name comes from the Old English ''liver'', meaning thick or muddy, and ''pol'', meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as ''Liuerpul''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, David|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=the University Press|isbn=0198605617|page=1110}}</ref><ref name=DH>{{cite web|title=Liverpool|publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Liverpool|last=Harper|first=Douglas}}</ref> According to the ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".<ref name=DH/> The adjective ''Liverpudlian'' is first recorded in 1833.<ref name=DH/>\n\n==Early history of the area==\n[[File:The Calder Stones, Calderstones Park - geograph.org.uk - 40880.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ancient neolithic Calder Stones on display in the Harthill Greenhouses]]\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the area around modern-day Liverpool was sparsely populated, though there was a seaport at [[Meols]]. The [[Calderstones Park|Calderstones]] are thought to be part of an ancient [[stone circle]] and there is archaeological evidence for native Iron Age farmsteads at several sites in [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]], [[Halewood]] and [[Lathom]]. The region was inhabited by [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] tribes, the [[Setantii]] as well as nearby [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] and [[Deceangli]]. It came under Roman influence in about 70 AD, with the northward advance to crush the [[druid]] resistance at [[Anglesey]] and to end the internal strife between the ruling family of [[Brigantes]]. The main Roman presence was at the fortress and settlement at [[Chester]]. According to [[Ptolemy]], the Latin hydronym for the [[Mersey]] was ''Seteia Aestuarium'', which derives from the Setantii tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/livingwithromans/ancestors.aspx|work=Museum of Liverpool|title=Our ancestors and the Roman invasion|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainCornovii.htm|work=The History Files|title=Celtic kingdoms of the British Isles|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, evidence of a Roman Tile works was found around the [[Tarbock]] Island area of the M62 and various Roman coins and Jewellery have been found in the Liverpool area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/roman-liverpool/|title=Roman Liverpool|website=History of Liverpool|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Roman troops, land in the area continued to be farmed by native [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]]. The [[Hen Ogledd]] (Old North) was subject to fighting between four medieval kingdoms: the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of Mercia]] eventually defeated its rival [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] as well as the Celtic kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], with the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] perhaps taking place at nearby [[Bromborough]]. The settlements at [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] (''Wealas tun'' meaning 'farmstead of the [[Walhaz|Wealas]]'), and [[Wallasey]] (''Wealas-eg'' meaning 'island of the Wealas') were named at this time with ''Wealas'' being [[Old English]] for 'foreigner' referring to the native [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Romano-British culture|Romanized inhabitants]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Eilert|last=Ekwall|authorlink=Eilert Ekwall|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names|publisher=OUP|year=1936}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Wales|title=Wales|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe pseudo-historical ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' appears to record the Norse settlement of the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] in its account of the immigration of [[Ingimundr (tenth century)|Ingimundr]] near Chester.

(circa 1200)]]\nAlthough a small [[motte and bailey]] castle had earlier been built by the Normans at [[West Derby]], the origins of the city of Liverpool are usually dated from 28 August 1207, when [[letters patent]] were issued by [[John of England|King John]] advertising the establishment of a new borough, \"Livpul\", and inviting settlers to come and take up holdings there. It is thought that the King wanted a port in the district that was free from the control of the [[Earl of Chester]]. Initially it served as a dispatch point for troops sent to Ireland, soon after the building around 1235 of [[Liverpool Castle]], which was removed in 1726. [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] was built by 1257, originally as a chapel within the parish of [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton-on-the-Hill]].<ref name=Belchem>{{cite book|editor-first=John|editor-last=Belchem|title=Liverpool 800: Culture, Character & History|year=2006|isbn=1-84631-035-0}}</ref> In the 13th Century, Liverpool as an area comprised just seven streets.\n\nWith the formation of a market on the site of the later Town Hall, Liverpool became established as a small fishing and farming community, administered by [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] and, slightly later, a mayor. There was probably some coastal trade around the [[Irish Sea]], and there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. However, for several centuries it remained a small and relatively unimportant settlement, with a population of no more than 1,000 in the mid 14th century. By the early fifteenth century a period of economic decline set in, and the county gentry increased their power over the town, the [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|Stanley]] family fortifying their house by building Stanley Tower on Water Street. This was a catalyst for a feud between the Stanley and [[Earl of Sefton|Molyneux]] families since the Molyneux family had permission to live at the nearby [[Liverpool Castle]] at that time. The resulting rivalry nearly spilled into a riot in 1424.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-molyneux-stanley-family-history/|title=Text only version of our interactive Liverpool Molyneux Stanley family history page.|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> In the middle of the 16th century the population of Liverpool had fallen to around 600, and the port was regarded as subordinate to [[Chester, England|Chester]] until the 1650s.\n\n==Elizabethan era and the Civil War==\n[[File:Liverpool.1572.jpg|thumb|Liverpool in 1572.]]\nIn 1571 the people of Liverpool sent a memorial to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], praying relief from a subsidy which they thought themselves unable to bear, wherein they styled themselves \"''her majesty's poor decayed town of Liverpool.''\" Some time towards the close of this reign, [[Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby]], on his way to the [[Isle of Man]], stayed at his house, the Tower; at which the corporation erected a handsome hall or seat for him in the church, where he honoured them several times with his presence.\n\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, the town began to be able to take advantage of economic revival and the silting of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] to win trade, mainly from Chester, to Ireland, the Isle of Man and elsewhere. In 1626, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] gave the town a new and improved charter.<ref name=Belchem />\n[[File:Liverpool.1650.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Liverpool in 1650.]]\n\nIn June 1644 [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] arrived in Liverpool with 10,000 men in an attempt to capture [[Liverpool Castle]]. A sixteen-day siege of Liverpool then took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|title=Civil War Siege of Liverpool|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403112400/http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|archive-date=3 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> To defend the city the [[New Model Army|Parliament Army]] created a huge trench across much of the town centre. Prince Rupert eventually took hold of the Castle only to be driven out again to take refuge in the Everton area of the city, hence the name of the tower found on the modern day Everton Football Club badge is known as [[Everton Lock-Up|Prince Rupert's Tower]].\n\n==Transatlantic trade==\nThe first cargo from the Americas was recorded in 1648. The development of the town accelerated after the Restoration of 1660, with the growth of trade with America and the [[West Indies]]. From that time may be traced the rapid progress of population and commerce, until Liverpool had become the second metropolis of Great Britain. Initially, cloth, coal and salt from Lancashire and Cheshire were exchanged for sugar and tobacco; the town's first sugar refinery was established in 1667.<ref>http://www.mawer.clara.net/loc-liverpool.html</ref>\n\nIn 1699 Liverpool was made a [[parish]] on its own by [[Act of Parliament]], separate from that of Walton-on-the-Hill, with two parish churches. At the same time it gained separate customs authority from Chester.<ref name=\"Belchem\" />\n\n==Slavery==\nOn 3 October 1699, the very same year that Liverpool had been granted status as an independent parish, Liverpool's first 'recorded' [[slave ship]], named ''Liverpool Merchant'', set sail for Africa, arriving in Barbados with a 'cargo' of 220 Africans, returning to Liverpool on 18 September 1700. The following month a second recorded ship, ''The Blessing'', set sail for the Gold Coast.\n\nThe first commercial [[wet dock]] in Britain was built in Liverpool and completed in 1715. It was the first in the world and was constructed for a capacity of 100 ships. By the close of the 18th century 40% of the world's, and 80% of Britain's Atlantic slave activity was accounted for by slave ships that voyaged from the [[:Category:Liverpool docks|docks at Liverpool]]. This growth led to the opening of the [[Consulate of the United States in Liverpool]] in 1790, its first consulate anywhere in the world.\n\nVast profits from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] transformed Liverpool into one of Britain's foremost important cities. Liverpool became a financial centre, rivalled by Bristol, another slaving port, and beaten only by London. In the peak year of 1799, ships sailing from Liverpool carried over 45,000 slaves from Africa.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nMany factors led to the demise of slavery including revolts, piracy, social unrest, and the repercussions of corruption such as slave insurance fraud, e.g. the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]] case in 1783. It was Liverpool born politician [[William Roscoe]] who spearheaded the anti-Slavery movement in parliament at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Liverpool Slave Trade |publisher=History of Liverpool |url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-slave-trade/ |accessdate=28  February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSlavery in British colonies was finally abolished in 1833 and slave trading was made illegal in 1807 though some slavery apprenticeships ran until 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/journey/american_connection/slavery/timeline.shtml|work=BBC|title=Liverpool Local History - American Connections - Slavery Timeline|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> However, many merchants managed to ignore the laws and continued to deal in underground slave trafficking, also underhandedly engaging in financial investments for slaving activities in the Americas.\n\n==Industrial revolution and commercial expansion==\n{{Gallery\n| title        = 19th Century Liverpool\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       =\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Cunard Line New York Liverpool 1875.jpg\n | alt1= [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n | [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n|File:George's Dock 1897.jpg\n|alt2=[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|File:Seaforth Sands railway station 1.jpg\n|alt3=[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]]\n|[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] [[Seaforth Sands railway station]] opened 1894, railway opened 1893, photo 1951\n|File:White Star Offices, Liverpool.jpg\n|alt4=[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|File:Roscoe GJR(1839) p155 - Entrance to the Railway Station at Liverpool.jpg\n|alt5=[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|File:Liverpool1890s.jpg\n|alt6=Colourised photo taken in the 1890s.

Liverpool was first linked by canal to Manchester in 1721, the [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] coalfield in 1755, and Leeds in 1816. In 1830, Liverpool became home to the world's first inter-urban rail link to another city, [[Manchester]], through the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the maiden journey Stephenson's [[Stephenson's Rocket|The Rocket]] train.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-railways/ |title = KS3 History Railways|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]], which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].\n\nThe built-up area grew rapidly from the eighteenth century on. The [[Liverpool Blue Coat School|Bluecoat Hospital]] for poor children opened in 1718. With the demolition of the castle in 1726, only [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] and the historic street plan - with Castle Street as the spine of the original settlement, and [[Paradise Street, Liverpool|Paradise Street]] following the line of the Pool - remained to reflect the town's mediaeval origins. The Town Hall, with a covered exchange for merchants designed by architect [[John Wood, the Elder|John Wood]], was built in 1754, and the first office buildings including the Corn Exchange were opened in about 1810.\n\nThroughout the 19th century Liverpool's trade and its population continued to expanded rapidly. Growth in the cotton trade was accompanied by the development of strong trading links with India and the Far East following the ending of the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company's]] monopoly in 1813. Over {{convert|140|acre|km2}} of new docks, with {{convert|10|mi|km}} of quay space, were opened between 1824 and 1858.<ref name=Belchem />\n\n[[File:Situationsplan von Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Map of Liverpool from 1880]]\nDuring the 1840s, [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants began arriving by the thousands due to the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Famine]] of 1845\u20131849. Almost 300,000 arrived in the year 1847 alone, and by 1851 approximately 25% of the city was Irish-born. The Irish influence is reflected in the unique place Liverpool occupies in UK and Irish political history, being the only place outside Ireland to elect a member of parliament from the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] to the British parliament in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]. [[T.P. O'Connor]] represented the constituency of [[Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Scotland]] from 1885 to 1929.\n\nAs the town became a leading port of the [[British Empire]], a number of major buildings were constructed, including [[St. George\u2019s Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]] (1854), and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street Station]]. The [[Grand National]] steeplechase was first run at Aintree in 1837.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-victorian-times/|title=KS3 History Victorian Times|work=History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126062459/http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-victorian-times/|archive-date=26 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1851 and 1911, Liverpool attracted at least 20,000 people from Wales in each decade, peaking in the 1880s, and Welsh culture flourished.  One of the first Welsh language journals, ''Yr Amserau'', was founded in Liverpool by [[William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog)]], and there were over 50 Welsh chapels in the city.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Davies|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=A History of Wales|year=1993|isbn=0-14-028475-3}}</ref>\n\nEarly regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as [[Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet)]] and [[Collins Line]] and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines [[Cunard Line]] and [[White Star Line]] continuing throughout the 19th Century.\n\nWhen the [[American Civil War]] broke out Liverpool became a hotbed of intrigue. The prevalence of cotton and slave interests in Liverpool ensured that the city was, in the words of the historian [[Sven Beckert]], \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Navy ship, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], was built at [[Birkenhead]] on the Mersey and the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] surrendered there (being the final surrender and end of the war).\n\nLiverpool was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1880, and the following year its [[Liverpool University|university]] was established. By 1901, the city's population had grown to over 700,000, and its boundaries had expanded to include [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]], [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Liverpool: Our City, Our Heritage|year=1990|first=Freddy|last=O'Connor|isbn=0-9516188-0-6}}</ref> [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton]], [[West Derby]] (in 1835 and 1895), [[Toxteth]] and [[Garston, Merseyside|Garston]].<ref name=Belchem />\n\n==20th century==\n\n===1900-1938===\n[[File:Nearly the end at Liverpool - geograph.org.uk - 1325640.jpg|thumb|left|By 1957, the once-great Liverpool tramway system had been reduced to just two routes, the 6A to Bowring Park and the 40 to Page Moss Avenue.

In 1904, the building of the [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]] began, and by 1916 the three [[Pier Head]] buildings, including the [[Liver Building]], were complete. This period marked the pinnacle of Liverpool's economic success, when it regarded itself as the \"second city\" of the [[British Empire]].<ref name=Belchem /> The formerly independent [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]], [[Childwall]], [[Woolton|Little Woolton and Much Woolton]] were added in 1913, and the parish of [[Speke]] added in 1932, with large housing developments, mostly by the local authority, being built over the next few years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10027317 |title=Liverpool CB/MB |work=A vision of Britain through time |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831062153/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3D06E75550A4804D79E1E30D8BAF9130D5?u_id=10027317#tab02 |archivedate=31 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]]'s half-brother Alois and his Irish sister-in-law [[Bridget Dowling]] are known to have lived in Upper Stanhope Street in the 1910s.

However, it was changed to depart from [[Southampton]] instead.\n\nAside from the large [[Irish people|Irish]] community in Liverpool, there were other pockets of cultural diversity. The area of Gerard, Hunter, Lionel and Whale streets, off [[Scotland Road]], was referred to as ''Little Italy''. Inspired by an old [[Venice|Venetian]] custom, Liverpool was 'married to the sea' in September 1928. Liverpool was also home to a large Welsh population, and was sometimes referred to as the Capital of North Wales. In 1884, 1900 and 1929, [[Eisteddfod]]s were held in Liverpool. The population of the city peaked at over 850,000 in the 1930s.\n\nEconomic changes began in the first part of the 20th century, as falls in world demand for the North West's traditional export commodities contributed to stagnation and decline in the city. Unemployment was well above the national average as early as the 1920s, and the city became known nationally for its occasionally violent religious [[sectarianism]].<ref name=Belchem />\n\nWhen [[Everton F.C.]] won the [[Football League First Division]] title in 1928, their centre-forward [[Dixie Dean]] scored a [[Football League]] record of 60 goals in the same season.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] hit Liverpool badly in the early 1930s with thousands of people in the city left unemployed. This was combated by a large amount of housing mostly built by the local council being constructed, creating jobs mostly in the building, plumbing and electrical trades. About 15 per cent of the city's population were rehoused in the 1920s and 1930s with more than 30,000 new council houses being built to replace the slums in the city.\n\nThe rising popularity of motor cars led to congestion in the city, and in 1934 the city gained its first direct road link with the [[Wirral Peninsula]], when the first [[Mersey Tunnel]] road was opened. The Queensway, as the new tunnel was named, linked Liverpool with [[Birkenhead]] at the other side of the Mersey. Many other buildings were built in the city in the 1930s to ease the depression and became local landmarks, with many buildings featuring American inspired architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|title=Creativity in the Great Depression|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627093143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1939-1945: World War II===\n{{main|Liverpool Blitz}}\nDuring World War 2, Liverpool was the control centre for the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. There were eighty [[Liverpool Blitz|air-raids on Merseyside]], with an especially concentrated series of raids in May 1941 which interrupted operations at the docks for almost a week. Some 2,500 people were killed,<ref>Some sources state 4,000</ref> almost half the homes in the metropolitan area sustained some damage and some 11,000 were totally destroyed. Over 70,000 people were made homeless.<ref name=Belchem /> [[John Lennon]], one of the founding members of [[The Beatles]], was born in Liverpool during an air-raid on 9 October 1940. All four members of The Beatles were born in the city during the war, rising to fame in the early 1960s.\n\n===1946-1979===\n[[File:Capel Celyn exposed tree stumps.jpg|right|thumb|Tree stumps exposed by low water level of reservoir, at [[Capel Celyn]], a Welsh village flooded to provide water for Liverpool.]]\n\nSignificant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the [[Seaforth Dock]], the largest dock project in Britain. However, the city has been suffering since the 1950s with the loss of numerous employers. By 1985 the population had fallen to 460,000. Declines in manufacturing and dock activity struck the city particularly hard. In 1956 [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] and its fourteen stations were closed and demolished and in 1957 [[Liverpool Corporation Tramways]] closed after the last tram ran in Liverpool.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led locally by Jack and [[Bessie Braddock]], came to power in the City Council for the first time.\n\nIn 1956, a [[private bill]] sponsored by [[Liverpool City Council]] was brought before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to develop a water reservoir from the [[Afon Tryweryn|Tryweryn Valley]]. The development would include the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]]. By obtaining authority via an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council would not require planning consent from the relevant Welsh Local Authorities. This, together with the fact that the village was one of the last Welsh-only speaking communities, ensured that the proposals became deeply controversial. Thirty five out of thirty six Welsh [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) opposed the bill (the other did not vote), but in 1957 it was passed. The members of the community waged an eight-year effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to prevent the destruction of their homes, which finally occurred in 1965. The incident led to a massive rise in [[Welsh nationalism]], and a year later, [[Gwynfor Evans]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] won the party's first seat in the [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|Carmathen by-election]].\n\nIn the 1960s Liverpool became a centre of [[youth culture]]. The city produced the distinctive [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] sound, most famously [[The Beatles]], and the [[Liverpool poets]].\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into further sharp decline. The advent of [[containerisation]] meant that Liverpool's docks ceased to be a major local employer. [[Liverpool Central High Level railway station]] closed in 1972, as well as the [[Waterloo Tunnel|Waterloo]], [[Victoria Tunnel (Liverpool)|Victoria]] and [[Wapping Tunnel|Wapping]] tunnels. In 1974, Liverpool became a [[metropolitan district]] within the newly created [[metropolitan county]] of [[Merseyside]]. In 1977 [[Liverpool Exchange railway station]] closed, and in 1979 the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] closed too. In 1972 [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific]] unit [[CP Ships]] were the last transatlantic line to operate from Liverpool.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw Liverpool's fortunes sink to their lowest postwar point. Although the 1970s, along with the rest of Britain, had brought economic difficulties and a steady rise in unemployment, the situation in Liverpool went from bad to worse in the early 1980s, with endless factory closures and some of the highest unemployment rates in the UK. An average of 12,000 people each year were leaving the city, and 15% of its land was vacant or derelict.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nIn July 1981 the infamous [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth Riots]] took place, during which, for the first time in the UK outside [[Northern Ireland]], [[tear gas]] was used by police against civilians. In the same year, the [[Tate and Lyle]] sugar works, previously a mainstay of the city's manufacturing economy, closed down. The docks had already declined dramatically by this stage, depriving the city of another major source of employment.\n\nBy 1985, unemployment in Liverpool exceeded 20%, around double the national average. About this time the scourge of heroin, always present in port cities, began to rise.\n\n[[Liverpool City Council]] was dominated by the far-left wing [[Militant tendency|Militant]] group during the 1980s, under the ''de facto'' leadership of [[Derek Hatton]] (although Hatton was formally only Deputy Leader). The city council sank heavily into debt, as the City Council fought a campaign to prevent central government from reducing funding for local services. Ultimately this led to 49 of the City's Councillors being removed from office by the District Auditor for refusing to cut the budget, refusing to make good the deficit and forcing the City Council into virtual bankruptcy. The conduct of Hatton and the militant tendency had even come under the scrutiny of Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]], who was keen to remove the militant tendency from the party as part of the attempt to make it electable again. At the same time, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] was deeply unpopular in Liverpool, with the Conservatives share of the vote in most local council and parliamentary elections being consistently low throughout the 1980s.\n\nOn 15 April 1989, 96 [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans (mostly from [[Merseyside]] as well as neighbouring parts of [[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]) were fatally injured in the [[Hillsborough disaster]] at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final in [[Sheffield]]. This had a traumatic effect on people across the country, particularly in and around the city of Liverpool, and resulted in legally imposed changes in the way in which football fans have since been accommodated, including compulsory all-seater stadiums at all leading English clubs by the mid 1990s. Many clubs removed their perimeter fencing almost immediately after the tragedy, and such measures at football grounds in England have long since been banned.\n\nIn particular this led to strong feeling in Liverpool because it was widely reported in the media that the Liverpool fans were at fault. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' sparked particular controversy for publishing these allegations in an article four days after the disaster. Sales of the newspaper in Liverpool slumped and many newsagents refused to stock it. Three decades later, many people in the city still refuse to buy ''The Sun'' and a number of newsagents still refuse to sell it. Other media outlets including the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also printed similar stories in which the behaviour of Liverpool fans was alleged to have been a major factor in the tragedy.\n\nThere was further controversy surrounding the tragedy in March 1991 when a verdict of accidental death was recorded on the 95 people who had died at Hillsborough (the 96th victim did not die until 1993), much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing, or an open verdict, to be recorded; and for criminal charges to be brought against South Yorkshire Police. This verdict was eventually replaced by one of unlawful killing at fresh inquest 25 years later.\n\nIt has since become clear that [[South Yorkshire Police]] made a range of mistakes at the game, though the senior officer in charge of the event retired soon after.\n\nThe success of Liverpool FC was some compensation for the city's economic misfortune during the 1970s and 1980s. The club, formed in 1892, had won five league titles by 1947, but enjoyed its first consistent run of success under the management of [[Bill Shankly]] between 1959 and 1974, winning a further three league titles as well as the club's first two [[FA Cup]]s and its first European trophy in the shape of the [[UEFA Cup]]. Following Shankly's retirement, the club continued to dominate English football for nearly 20 years afterwards. By 1990, Liverpool FC had won more major trophies than any other English club - a total of 18 top division league titles, four FA Cups, four [[Football League Cup]]s, four [[European Cup]]s and two UEFA Cups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisanfield.com/clubinfo/honours/|title=Liverpool FC Honours List|work=This is Anfield|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> The club's iconic red shirt had been worn by some of the biggest names in British sport of the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Kevin Keegan]], [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who also served as manager from 1985 to 1991 and again from 2011 to 2012), [[Phil Neal]], [[Ian Rush]], [[Ian Callaghan]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]].

Tourism has become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy, capitalising on the popularity of The Beatles and other groups of the Merseybeat era.
