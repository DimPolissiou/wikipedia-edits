{"title_page": "Calque", "text_new": "{{Short description|Loaned translation of an expression}}\n{{distinguish|literal translation|claque}}\n\n{{Refimprove|article|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn [[linguistics]], a '''calque''' {{IPAc-en|k|\u00e6|l|k}} or '''loan translation''' is a [[word]] or [[phrase]] borrowed from another language by [[literal translation|literal]], word-for-word or root-for-root translation. When used as a [[verb]], \"to calque\" means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new [[lexeme]] in the target language.\n\n\"Calque\" itself is a [[loanword]] from the French [[noun]] {{wikt-lang|fr|calque}} (\"tracing; imitation; close copy\").<ref>[http://germanenglishwords.com/ Robb: German English Words germanenglishwords.com]</ref> Proving that a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than does an untranslated loanword because, in some cases, a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the borrowing language, or when the calque contains less obvious imagery.\n\nCalquing is distinct from [[phono-semantic matching]].<ref name=\"palgrave.com\">{{cite book |last = Zuckermann |first = Ghil'ad |author-link = Ghil'ad Zuckermann |title = Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |url = http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year = 2003 |ISBN = 1-4039-1723-X }}</ref> While calquing includes [[semantic]] [[translation]], it does not consist of [[phonetic]] matching (i.e., retaining the approximate [[sound]] of the borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existing word or [[morpheme]] in the target language).\n\n== Types ==\nOne system classifies calques into five groups:<ref>May Smith, ''The Influence of French on Eighteenth-century Literary Russian'', pp.&nbsp;29&ndash;30.</ref>\n* the '''phraseological calque''', with [[idiom|idiomatic phrase]]s being translated word-for-word. For example, \"[[:wiktionary:go without saying|it goes without saying]]\" calques the French {{lang|fr|\u00e7a va sans dire}}.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/116/105.html Foreign Words. Fowler, H. W. 1908. The King's English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* the '''syntactic calque''', with syntactic functions or constructions of the source language being imitated in the target language, in violation of their meaning. For example, in Spanish the legal term for \u201cto find guilty\u201d is properly {{lang|es|declarar culpable}} (\u201cto declare guilty\u201d). Informal usage, however, is shifting to {{lang|es|encontrar culpable}}: a syntactic mapping of \"to find\" without a semantic correspondence in Spanish of \u201cfind\u201d to mean \u201cdetermine as true\u201d.<ref>[https://paulweston80.wordpress.com/2016/01/13/if-my-calqueulations-are-correct/ If my Calqueulations are Correct, Paul Weston]</ref>\n* the '''loan-translation''', with words being translated [[morpheme]]-by-morpheme or component-by-component into another language. The two morphemes of the Swedish word {{wikt-lang|sv|ton\u00e5ring}} calque each part of the English \"teenager\": {{wikt-lang|sv|femton|fem'''ton'''}} \"fif'''teen'''\" and {{wikt-lang|sv|\u00e5ring}} \"year-old\" (as in the phrase {{lang|sv|tolv-\u00e5ring}} \"twelve-year-old\").\n* the '''semantic calque''', with additional meanings of the source word being transferred to the word with the same primary meaning in the target language. This is also called a \"[[semantic loan]]\". As described below, the \"[[computer mouse]]\" was named in English for its resemblance to the animal; many other languages have extended their own native word for \"mouse\" to include the computer mouse. \n* the '''morphological calque''', with the inflection of a word being transferred.\n\nThis terminology is not universal. Some authors call a morphological calque a \"morpheme-by-morpheme translation\".<ref name=\"gilliot\">Claude Gilliot, \"The Authorship of the Qur'\u0101n\" in Gabriel Said Reynolds, ''The Qur'an in its Historical Context'', p. 97</ref>\n\nOther linguists refer to the '''phonological calque''', where the pronunciation of a word is imitated in the other language.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vP2jibCnejQC Specialised Dictionaries for Learners edited by Pedro Antonio Fuertes Olivera, p. 187]</ref> For example, the English word ''\"radar\"'' becomes the similar-sounding Chinese word {{wikt-lang|zh|\u96f7\u8fbe}} (pinyin ''\"l\u00e9i d\u00e1\"'').\n\n=={{anchor|Loan blend}}Loan blend==\n'''Loan blends''' or '''partial calques''' translate some parts of a compound, but not others.<ref>Philip Durkin, ''The Oxford Guide to Etymology'', sec. 5.1.4</ref> For example, the name of the Irish digital television service [[Saorview]] is a partial calque of that of the UK service [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], translating the first half of the word from English to Irish but leaving the second half unchanged. Other examples are: \"[[liverwurst]]\" (< German {{wikt-lang|de|Leberwurst}}), \"[[apple strudel]]\" (< German {{wikt-lang|de|Apfelstrudel}}).\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Main list|List of calques}}\n\n===

He dealt with the turmoil and self-imposed sanctions of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]] in his first years with [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]], where he eventually won the [[2004 National Invitation Tournament]] with the [[2003\u201304 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]] and finished as the runner-up with Michigan in the [[2006 National Invitation Tournament]].\n\nIn his tenure as [[Harvard Crimson|Harvard]] men's basketball coach, he was the first coach to lead the Crimson to victory over a ranked opponent with the {{cbb link|2008|sex=men|team=Harvard Crimson|school=Harvard University|title=2008\u201309 team}}.  He also coached the [[2009\u201310 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team]] into the postseason ([[2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament]]) in his third year there, which included the highest single-season victory total (21) in school history. In the summer of 2010, the NCAA ruled that Amaker had committed a recruiting violation, resulting in NCAA-mandated recruiting restrictions, the university's first NCAA penalty of the men's basketball program. The [[2010\u201311 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2010\u201311 team]] became the first Harvard men's basketball team to clinch a share of the Ivy League championship and surpassed the prior season win total (23).  The [[2011\u201312 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2011\u201312 team]] became the first in school history to appear in the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] (AP) and [[Coaches Poll]]s and, for the third year in a row, established a new school record for wins (26). Amaker's 2011\u201312, [[2012\u201313 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2012\u201313]], [[2013\u201314 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2013\u201314]] and [[2014\u201315 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2014\u201315 teams]] repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012\u201313 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory. The 2013\u201314 team posted a record 27 wins. Amaker became the winningest coach in school history in 2016.\n\n==Early years==\nAmaker was born in [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], Virginia, in 1965.

[[Harvard University]] men's [[Harvard Crimson men's basketball|basketball]] team. He has also coached for the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] and [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall University]]. He played [[point guard]] and later served as an assistant coach at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] under [[Mike Krzyzewski]].  An [[All-American]] player, Amaker set numerous records and earned many honors and awards.  He took Seton Hall to the post season in each of his four seasons as their coach, helped Michigan win the [[National Invitation Tournament]] the year after a probationary ban from postseason play, and had the three highest single-season win totals in the history of Harvard basketball, the school's first six [[Ivy League]] championships and first NCAA tournament victory.\n\nAmaker was a [[high school basketball]] [[McDonald's All-American]] and a [[Parade All-American]]. As a college basketball player, he set most of the [[assist (basketball)|assists]] records and many [[steal (basketball)|steals]] records for [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke basketball]].  He also set the  [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] single-season games played and games started records.  Among his numerous accolades, he was the first winner of the [[NABC Defensive Player of the Year]], and he was a third team All-American.\n\nAmaker was an assistant coach for the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball under Krzyzewski for nine seasons.  His first four seasons were part of a five-year streak of Final Four appearances by Duke (including back-to-back national championships). As a head coach, Amaker took the [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] to postseason tournaments ([[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] \u2013 [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2000]] and National Invitation Tournament \u2013 [[1998 National Invitation Tournament|1998]], [[1999 National Invitation Tournament|1999]], and [[2001 National Invitation Tournament|2001]]) in each of his four seasons as their coach. He dealt with the turmoil and self-imposed sanctions of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]] in his first years with [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]], where he eventually won the [[2004 National Invitation Tournament]] with the [[2003\u201304 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]] and finished as the runner-up with Michigan in the [[2006 National Invitation Tournament]].\n\nIn his tenure as [[Harvard Crimson|Harvard]] men's basketball coach, he was the first coach to lead the Crimson to victory over a ranked opponent with the {{cbb link|2008|sex=men|team=Harvard Crimson|school=Harvard University|title=2008\u201309 team}}.  He also coached the [[2009\u201310 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team]] into the postseason ([[2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament]]) in his third year there, which included the highest single-season victory total (21) in school history. In the summer of 2010, the NCAA ruled that Amaker had committed a recruiting violation, resulting in NCAA-mandated recruiting restrictions, the university's first NCAA penalty of the men's basketball program. The [[2010\u201311 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2010\u201311 team]] became the first Harvard men's basketball team to clinch a share of the Ivy League championship and surpassed the prior season win total (23).  The [[2011\u201312 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2011\u201312 team]] became the first in school history to appear in the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] (AP) and [[Coaches Poll]]s and, for the third year in a row, established a new school record for wins (26). Amaker's 2011\u201312, [[2012\u201313 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2012\u201313]], [[2013\u201314 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2013\u201314]] and [[2014\u201315 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2014\u201315 teams]] repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012\u201313 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory. The 2013\u201314 team posted a record 27 wins. Amaker became the winningest coach in school history in 2016.\n\n==Early years==\nAmaker was born in [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], Virginia, in 1965. He was raised by a single mother, Alma Amaker, a high school English teacher.   Although not a part of Amaker's young life, his father attended some of Amaker's high school basketball games.<ref name=A06p/>\n\nAmaker resided in Falls Church, but he attended [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T.

The type sites are named for the villages of '''Mal'ta''' ({{lang|ru|\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0301}}), [[Usolsky District, Irkutsk Oblast|Usolsky District]] and '''Buret' ''' ({{lang|ru|\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c}}), [[Bokhansky District]] (both in [[Irkutsk Oblast]]).\n\nA boy whose remains were found near Mal'ta is usually known by the abbreviation '''MA-1''' (or MA1). Discovered in the 1920s, the remains have been dated to 24,000 BP. According to research published since 2013, MA-1 belonged to a population related to the genetic ancestors of [[Siberia]]ns, [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Haplogroup R1|American Indians]], and Bronze Age [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya]] and [[Botai culture|Botai]]<ref name=\"urlCharacterizing the genetic history of admixture across inner Eurasia | bioRxiv\">{{cite web |url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/327122v1.full |title=Characterizing the genetic history of admixture across inner Eurasia &#124; bioRxiv |format= |work= |accessdate=|quote=The Eneolithic Botai individuals are closer to each other in the PC space than to any other ancient or present-day individual, and are in proximity to the upper Paleolithic Siberians from the Mal\u2019ta (MA-1) or Afontova Gora (AG3) archaeological sites}}</ref> people of the [[Eurasian steppe]].{{sfn|Raghavan|Skoglund et al.|2014}}{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis et al.|2015}} In particular, modern-day [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Ket people|Kets]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], and [[selkup people|Selkup]] have been found to harbour a lot of ancestry related to MA-1.{{sfn|Flegontov|Changmai et al.|2015}}\n\nMuch of what is known about Mal'ta comes from the Russian archaeologist [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]]. Better known later for his contribution to the branch of anthropology known as [[forensic facial reconstruction]], Gerasimov made revolutionary discoveries when he excavated Mal'ta in 1927. Until his findings, the Upper Paleolithic societies of Northern Asia were virtually unknown. Over the remainder of his career, Gerasimov twice more visited Mal'ta to excavate and research the site.\n\n==Material culture==\n===Habitation and tools===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nMal'ta consists of semi-subterranean houses that were built using large animal bones to assemble the walls, and reindeer antlers covered with animal skins to construct a roof that would protect the inhabitants from the harsh elements of the Siberian weather.\n\nEvidence seems to indicate that Mal'ta is the most ancient known site in eastern Siberia; however, relative dating illustrates some irregularities. The use of flint flaking and the absence of pressure flaking used in the manufacture of tools, as well as the continued use of earlier forms of tools, seem to confirm the fact that the site belongs to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Yet it lacks typical [[skreblo]]s (large side scrapers) that are common in other Siberian Paleolithic sites. Additionally, other common characteristics such as pebble cores, wedge-shaped cores, burins, and composite tools have never been found. The lack of these features, combined with an art style found in only one other nearby site, make Mal'ta culture unique in Siberia.\n\n===Art===\nThere were two main types of art during the Upper Paleolithic: mural art, which was concentrated in Western Europe, and portable art. Portable art, typically some type of carving in ivory tusk or antler, spans the distance across Western Europe into Northern and Central Asia. Artistic remains of expertly carved bone, ivory, and antler objects depicting birds and human females are the most commonly found; these objects are, collectively, the primary source of Mal'ta's acclaim.\n\nIn addition to the female statuettes there are bird sculptures depicting swans, geese, and ducks. Through ethnographic analogy comparing the ivory objects and burials at Mal'ta with objects used by 19th and 20th-century Siberian shamans, it has been suggested that they are evidence of a fully developed shamanism.\n\nAlso, there are engraved representations on slabs of mammoth tusk. One is the figure of a mammoth, easily recognizable by the trunk, tusks, and thick legs. Wool also seems to be etched, by the placement of straight lines along the body. Another drawing depicts three snakes with their heads puffed up and turned to the side. It is believed that they were similar to cobras.\n\n====Venus figurines====\n{{Main|Mal'ta Venus|Venus of Buret'}}\nPerhaps the best example of Paleolithic portable art is something referred to as \"[[Venus figurines]]\". Until they were discovered in Mal'ta, \"Venus figurines\" were previously found only in Europe. Carved from the ivory tusk of a mammoth, these images were typically highly stylized, and often involved embellished and disproportionate characteristics (typically the breasts or buttocks). It is widely believed that these emphasized features were meant to be symbols of fertility. Around thirty female statuettes of varying shapes have been found in Mal'ta. The wide variety of forms, combined with the realism of the sculptures and the lack of repetitiveness in detail, are definite signs of developed, albeit early, art.\n\nAt first glance, what is obvious is that the Mal'ta Venus figurines are of two types: full-figured women with exaggerated forms, and women with a thin, delicate form. Some of the figures are nude, while others have etchings that seem to indicate fur or clothing. Conversely, unlike those found in Europe, some of the Venus figurines from Mal'ta were sculpted with faces. Most of the figurines were tapered at the bottom, and it is believed that this was done to enable them to be stuck into the ground or otherwise placed upright. Placed upright, they could have symbolized the spirits of the dead, akin to \"spirit dolls\" used nearly worldwide, including in Siberia, among contemporary people.\n\n;Context of the Venus figurines\nThe Mal'ta figurines garner interest in the western world because they seem to be of the same basic form as European female figurines of roughly the same time period. This similarity between Mal'ta and Upper Paleolithic Europe coincides with other suggested similarities between the two, such as in their tools and dwelling structures{{Citation needed|reason=evidence for similarity in tools and dwellings?|date=November 2017}}.\n\nOn the other hand, one can argue that, as a group, the Mal'ta Venus figurines are rather different from the female figurines of Western and Central Europe. For example, none of the Siberian specimens depict abdominal enlargement as many European examples do. Also, as breasts are often lacking in the Mal'ta figurines, few offer clear enough evidence of gender to define them as female. More conclusively, nearly half of them show some facial details, something which is lacking in the Venus figurines of Europe. It may not be possible to reach a definitive answer as to the origins of these peoples and their culture.\n\nA 2016 genomic study shows that the Mal'ta people have no genetic connections to the [[Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice (archaeology)|Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice people]] from the [[Gravettian culture]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fu |first1=Qiaomei |last2=Posth |first2=Cosimo |last3=Hajdinjak |first3=Mateja |title=The genetic history of Ice Age Europe |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=504 |issue=7606 |pages=200\u20135 |date=May 2, 2016 |doi=10.1038/nature17993 |pmid=27135931 |pmc=4943878 |display-authors=2 |bibcode=2016Natur.534..200F|hdl=10211.3/198594 }}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\nDiscussing this easternmost outpost of [[paleolithic]] culture, [[Joseph Campbell]] finishes by commenting on the symbolic forms of the artifacts found there:\n:We are clearly in a [[paleolithic]] province where the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], [[labyrinth]], and rebirth themes already constitute a symbolic constellation, joined with the imagery of the sunbird and [[shaman]] flight, with the goddess in her classic role of [[Hestia|protectress of the hearth]], mother of man's second birth, and [[Potnia Theron|lady of wild things]] and of the food supply.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Primitive Mythology|year=1987|isbn=0-14-019443-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/masksofgod00camp_0/page/331 331]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/masksofgod00camp_0/page/331}}</ref>\n\n==Archaeogenetics==\n{{main|Ancient North Eurasian}}{{anchor|ANE}}\nMA-1 is the only known example of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Haplogroup R-M207|Y-DNA R*]] (R-M207*) \u2013 that is, the only member of haplogroup [[Haplogroup R-M207|R*]] that did not belong to haplogroups [[Haplogroup R-M173|R1]], [[Haplogroup R-M124|R2]] or secondary subclades of these.

The type sites are named for the villages of '''Mal'ta''' ({{lang|ru|\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0301}}), [[Usolsky District, Irkutsk Oblast|Usolsky District]] and '''Buret' ''' ({{lang|ru|\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c}}), [[Bokhansky District]] (both in [[Irkutsk Oblast]]).\n\nA boy whose remains were found near Mal'ta is usually known by the abbreviation '''MA-1''' (or MA1). Discovered in the 1920s, the remains have been dated to 24,000 BP. According to research published since 2013, MA-1 belonged to a population related to the genetic ancestors of [[Siberia]]ns, [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Haplogroup R1|American Indians]], and Bronze Age [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya]] and [[Botai culture|Botai]]<ref name=\"urlCharacterizing the genetic history of admixture across inner Eurasia | bioRxiv\">{{cite web |url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/327122v1.full |title=Characterizing the genetic history of admixture across inner Eurasia &#124; bioRxiv |format= |work= |accessdate=|quote=The Eneolithic Botai individuals are closer to each other in the PC space than to any other ancient or present-day individual, and are in proximity to the upper Paleolithic Siberians from the Mal\u2019ta (MA-1) or Afontova Gora (AG3) archaeological sites}}</ref> people of the [[Eurasian steppe]].{{sfn|Raghavan|Skoglund et al.|2014}}{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis et al.|2015}} In particular, modern-day [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Ket people|Kets]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], and [[selkup people|Selkup]] have been found to harbour a lot of ancestry related to MA-1.{{sfn|Flegontov|Changmai et al.|2015}}\n\nMuch of what is known about Mal'ta comes from the Russian archaeologist [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]]. Better known later for his contribution to the branch of anthropology known as [[forensic facial reconstruction]], Gerasimov made revolutionary discoveries when he excavated Mal'ta in 1927. Until his findings, the Upper Paleolithic societies of Northern Asia were virtually unknown. Over the remainder of his career Gerasimov twice more visited Mal'ta to excavate and research the site.\n\n==Material culture==\n===Habitation and tools===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nMal'ta consists of semi-subterranean houses that were built using large animal bones to assemble the walls, and reindeer antlers covered with animal skins to construct a roof that would protect the inhabitants from the harsh elements of the Siberian weather.\n\nEvidence seems to indicate that Mal'ta is the most ancient known site in eastern Siberia; however, relative dating illustrates some irregularities. The use of flint flaking and the absence of pressure flaking used in the manufacture of tools, as well as the continued use of earlier forms of tools, seem to confirm the fact that the site belongs to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Yet it lacks typical [[skreblo]]s (large side scrapers) that are common in other Siberian Paleolithic sites. Additionally, other common characteristics such as pebble cores, wedge-shaped cores, burins, and composite tools have never been found. The lack of these features, combined with an art style found in only one other nearby site, make Mal'ta culture unique in Siberia.\n\n===Art===\nThere were two main types of art during the Upper Paleolithic: mural art, which was concentrated in Western Europe, and portable art. Portable art, typically some type of carving in ivory tusk or antler, spans the distance across Western Europe into Northern and Central Asia. Artistic remains of expertly carved bone, ivory, and antler objects depicting birds and human females are the most commonly found; these objects are, collectively, the primary source of Mal'ta's acclaim.\n\nIn addition to the female statuettes there are bird sculptures depicting swans, geese, and ducks. Through ethnographic analogy comparing the ivory objects and burials at Mal'ta with objects used by 19th and 20th century Siberian shamans, it has been suggested that they are evidence of a fully developed shamanism.\n\nAlso, there are engraved representations on slabs of mammoth tusk. One is the figure of a mammoth, easily recognizable by the trunk, tusks and thick legs. Wool also seems to be etched, by the placement of straight lines along the body. Another drawing depicts three snakes with their heads puffed up and turned to the side. It is believed that they were similar to cobras.\n\n====Venus figurines====\n{{Main|Mal'ta Venus|Venus of Buret'}}\nPerhaps the best example of Paleolithic portable art is something referred to as \"[[Venus figurines]]\". Until they were discovered in Mal'ta, \"Venus figurines\" were previously found only in Europe. Carved from the ivory tusk of a mammoth, these images were typically highly stylized, and often involved embellished and disproportionate characteristics (typically the breasts or buttocks). It is widely believed that these emphasized features were meant to be symbols of fertility. Around thirty female statuettes of varying shapes have been found in Mal'ta. The wide variety of forms, combined with the realism of the sculptures and the lack of repetitiveness in detail, are definite signs of developed, albeit early, art.\n\nAt first glance, what is obvious is that the Mal'ta Venus figurines are of two types: full figured women with exaggerated forms, and women with a thin, delicate form. Some of the figures are nude, while others have etchings that seem to indicate fur or clothing. Conversely, unlike those found in Europe, some of the Venus figurines from Mal'ta were sculpted with faces. Most of the figurines were tapered at the bottom, and it is believed that this was done to enable them to be stuck into the ground or otherwise placed upright. Placed upright, they could have symbolized the spirits of the dead, akin to \"spirit dolls\" used nearly worldwide, including in Siberia, among contemporary people.\n\n;Context of the Venus figurines\nThe Mal'ta figurines garner interest in the western world because they seem to be of the same basic form as European female figurines of roughly the same time period. This similarity between Mal'ta and Upper Paleolithic Europe coincides with other suggested similarities between the two, such as in their tools and dwelling structures{{Citation needed|reason=evidence for similarity in tools and dwellings?|date=November 2017}}.\n\nOn the other hand, one can argue that, as a group, the Mal'ta Venus figurines are rather different from the female figurines of Western and Central Europe. For example, none of the Siberian specimens depict abdominal enlargement as many European examples do. Also, as breasts are often lacking in the Mal'ta figurines, few offer clear enough evidence of gender to define them as female. More conclusively, nearly half of them show some facial details, something which is lacking in the Venus figurines of Europe. It may not be possible to reach a definitive answer as to the origins of these peoples and their culture.\n\nA 2016 genomic study shows that the Mal'ta people have no genetic connections to the [[Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice (archaeology)|Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice people]] from the [[Gravettian culture]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fu |first1=Qiaomei |last2=Posth |first2=Cosimo |last3=Hajdinjak |first3=Mateja |title=The genetic history of Ice Age Europe |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=504 |issue=7606 |pages=200\u20135 |date=May 2, 2016 |doi=10.1038/nature17993 |pmid=27135931 |pmc=4943878 |display-authors=2 |bibcode=2016Natur.534..200F|hdl=10211.3/198594 }}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\nDiscussing this easternmost outpost of [[paleolithic]] culture, [[Joseph Campbell]] finishes by commenting on the symbolic forms of the artifacts found there:\n:We are clearly in a [[paleolithic]] province where the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], [[labyrinth]], and rebirth themes already constitute a symbolic constellation, joined with the imagery of the sunbird and [[shaman]] flight, with the goddess in her classic role of [[Hestia|protectress of the hearth]], mother of man's second birth, and [[Potnia Theron|lady of wild things]] and of the food supply.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Primitive Mythology|year=1987|isbn=0-14-019443-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/masksofgod00camp_0/page/331 331]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/masksofgod00camp_0/page/331}}</ref>\n\n==Archaeogenetics==\n{{main|Ancient North Eurasian}}{{anchor|ANE}}\nMA-1 is the only known example of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Haplogroup R-M207|Y-DNA R*]] (R-M207*) \u2013 that is, the only member of haplogroup [[Haplogroup R-M207|R*]] that did not belong to haplogroups [[Haplogroup R-M173|R1]], [[Haplogroup R-M124|R2]] or secondary subclades of these.
