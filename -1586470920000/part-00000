The monastery's central village was Pomuk (now [[Nepomuk]]).

As a result, Jan became recognized as a local legendary religious-figure [[John of Nepomuk|\"Jan Nepomuck\u00fd\" or \"John of Nepomuk,\"]] leading to [[Pilgrim|pilgrimage]] and his later [[sainthood]].\n\nOn the hill between Pomuk and the monastery, [[Hussites|Hussite]] forces created a fort in 1419 which became [[Zelen\u00e1 Hora Castle]] in 1424.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis around 1858 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc. Was born on 26 August 1933 in B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory. After the school in Myslivna she attended the Federal Girls' Gymnasium in Ceske Budejovice and from 1945 until 1951 the State Real Grammar School of Jan Masaryk in Prague.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity \u2013 museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''habroptilus''. The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the \"owl parrot\". The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble [[whiskers|vibrissae]] or \"whiskers\"; it is possible kakapo use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [[dactyly|zygodactyl]] (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n[[File:K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d head.jpg|thumb|left|The \"whiskers\" around the beak.]]\nFemales are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller [[Beak#Cere|cere]] and [[Beak#Nares|nostrils]], more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a [[brood patch]] of bare skin on the belly.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe kakapo's [[Altriciality|altricial]] young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green colouration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resemble eyelashes.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\" />\n\nLike many other parrots, kakapo have a variety of calls.

Its [[optic tectum]], [[nucleus rotundus]], and [[Avian pallium|entopallium]] are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight.

Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, [[vestigial]] keel and a shortened [[spina externa]]. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the [[furcula]] is not fused but consists of a pair of [[clavicles]] lying in contact with each [[coracoid]]. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.<ref name=\"Livezey1992\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Livezey | first1 = Bradley C.\n| doi = 10.1002/jmor.1052130108\n| pmid = 29865598\n| title = Morphological corollaries and ecological implications of flightlessness in the kakapo (Psittaciformes: ''Strigops habroptilus'')\n| journal = Journal of Morphology\n| volume = 213\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 105\u2013145\n|date=July 1992\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] musculature of the kakapo is also modified by flightlessness.

Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kakapo was caught and released in the [[Milford Sound]] catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [[aviary|aviaries]] of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [[Masterton]] in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12&nbsp;years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Donald |first1=Paul F. |last2=Collar |first2=Nigel J.|last3=Marsden |first3=Stuart J. |last4=Pain |first4=Deborah J. |title=Facing Extinction: The World's Rarest Birds and the Race to Save Them |year=2010 |publisher=T & A D Poyser |location=London |isbn=978-0-7136-7021-9 |p=167}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming. These observations led [[Don Merton]] to speculate for the first time that the kakapo had a [[Lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system.<ref name=\"Merton77\"/> From 1974 to 1978 a total of 18&nbsp;kakapo were discovered in Fiordland, but all were males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened \"Richard Henry\", and transferred to [[Maud Island]]. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [[glaciated valley]]s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nBefore 1977, no expedition had been to [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]] to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on [[Stewart Island]].<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/> An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified [[scrubland]] and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200&nbsp;birds.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9518039 |last1=Powlesland |first1=R.G. |last2=Roberts|first2=A. |last3=Lloyd |first3=B.D. |last4=Merton |first4=D.V. |authorlink4=Don Merton |year=1995 |title=Number, fate and distribution of kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') found on Stewart Island, New Zealand, 1979\u201392 |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013248}}</ref>\n\n[[Mustelid]]s have never colonised [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]], but feral cats were present.

A small video camera and [[Infrared|infra-red light source]] would watch the nest continuously, and scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds.\n\nAll kakapo islands are now rat-free, but infrared cameras still allow rangers to remotely monitor the behaviour of females and chicks in nests. Data loggers record when mother kakapo come and go, allowing rangers to pick a time to check on the health of chicks, and also indicate how hard females are having to work to find food.

Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to  [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore; however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by M\u0101ori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapo were also occasionally kept as pets.\n\nThe kakapo is critically endangered; the total known adult population is {{Number_of_Living_Kakapo}}<!-- see link on talk page for editing this number --> [[List of kakapo|living individuals]], all of which are named and tagged, confined to four small islands off the coast of New Zealand that have been cleared of predators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/26/world/kakapo-conservation-scn-c2e-intl-hnk/index.html|title=Can tech save New Zealand's 'gorgeous, hilarious' parrot?|first=Sarah |last=Lazarus|website=CNN|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref> The [[Invasive species in New Zealand|introduction of predators]] such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats during British colonisation  almost wiped out the kakapo.

Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity \u2013 museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''habroptilus''. The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the \"owl parrot\". The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble [[whiskers|vibrissae]] or \"whiskers\"; it is possible kakapo use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [[dactyly|zygodactyl]] (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n[[File:K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d head.jpg|thumb|left|The \"whiskers\" around the beak.]]\nFemales are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller [[Beak#Cere|cere]] and [[Beak#Nares|nostrils]], more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a [[brood patch]] of bare skin on the belly.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe kakapo's [[Altriciality|altricial]] young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green colouration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resemble eyelashes.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\" />\n\nLike many other parrots, kakapo have a variety of calls. As well as the ''booms'' (see [[Kakapo#Media|below]] for a recording) and ''chings'' of their mating calls, they will often loudly ''skraark''.<ref name=\"CloseUp\"/>\n\nThe kakapo has a well-developed [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], which complements its nocturnal lifestyle.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Hagelin | first1 = Julie C.\n| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00212.x\n| title = Observations on the olfactory ability of the kakapo ''Strigops habroptilus'', the critically endangered parrot of New Zealand\n| journal = [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]\n| volume = 146\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 161\u2013164\n|date=January 2004\n}}</ref> It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\"/> The kakapo has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\" /> One of the most striking characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour.<ref name=\"CloseUp\">{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/up-close-and-personal/|title=Up Close & Personal|publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref> The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildinfo.net/facts/Kakapo.asp?page=/facts/Kakapo.asp|title=Kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'')|publisher=Wild Magazine}}</ref>\n\nAs a nocturnal species, the kakapo has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its [[optic tectum]], [[nucleus rotundus]], and [[Avian pallium|entopallium]] are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight.

Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, [[vestigial]] keel and a shortened [[spina externa]].

Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful.

Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the [[Whanganui River]] as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the [[Kaimanawa Range]]s by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.<ref name=\"FLM\"/>\n\n===Early protection efforts===\nIn 1891, the New Zealand government set aside [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]] in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed [[Richard Treacy Henry|Richard Henry]] as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and [[kiwi]] from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200&nbsp;kakapo to Resolution Island.

Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kakapo was caught and released in the [[Milford Sound]] catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [[aviary|aviaries]] of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [[Masterton]] in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12&nbsp;years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Donald |first1=Paul F. |last2=Collar |first2=Nigel J.|last3=Marsden |first3=Stuart J. |last4=Pain |first4=Deborah J. |title=Facing Extinction: The World's Rarest Birds and the Race to Save Them |year=2010 |publisher=T & A D Poyser |location=London |isbn=978-0-7136-7021-9 |p=167}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming. These observations led [[Don Merton]] to speculate for the first time that the kakapo had a [[Lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system.<ref name=\"Merton77\"/> From 1974 to 1978 a total of 18&nbsp;kakapo were discovered in Fiordland, but all were males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened \"Richard Henry\", and transferred to [[Maud Island]]. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [[glaciated valley]]s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nBefore 1977, no expedition had been to [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]] to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on [[Stewart Island]].<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/> An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified [[scrubland]] and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200&nbsp;birds.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9518039 |last1=Powlesland |first1=R.G. |last2=Roberts|first2=A. |last3=Lloyd |first3=B.D. |last4=Merton |first4=D.V. |authorlink4=Don Merton |year=1995 |title=Number, fate and distribution of kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') found on Stewart Island, New Zealand, 1979\u201392 |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013248}}</ref>\n\n[[Mustelid]]s have never colonised [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]], but feral cats were present.

Before [[Polynesian rat]]s were removed from Whenua Hou, they were a threat to the survival of young kakapo. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats.<ref name=\"Elliott2001\" /> Nest protection was intensified after 1995 by using [[rat trap|traps]] and poison stations as soon as a nest was detected. A small video camera and [[Infrared|infra-red light source]] would watch the nest continuously, and scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds.\n\nAll kakapo islands are now rat-free, but infrared cameras still allow rangers to remotely monitor the behaviour of females and chicks in nests. Data loggers record when mother kakapo come and go, allowing rangers to pick a time to check on the health of chicks, and also indicate how hard females are having to work to find food. Because mother kakapo often struggle to successfully rear multiple chicks, Kakapo Recovery rangers will move chicks between nests as needed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEggs are often removed from nests for incubation to reduce the likelihood of accidents, such as lost eggs or crushing.

The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or \"[[Mast year|masting]]\" events of particular plant species such as the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]], which led M\u0101ori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future.<ref name=\"MBL\">{{cite book |first=Murdoch |last=Riley |title=Maori Bird Lore; An introduction |publisher=Viking Sevenseas NZ LTD. |year=2001}}</ref> Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the [[Elaeocarpus dentatus|hinau]] and [[Tawa (tree)|tawa]] trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the M\u0101ori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.<ref name=\"MBL\"/>\n\n===Use for food and clothing===\n[[File:Strigops habroptilus (AM LB14666-3).jpg|thumb|upright|Feathers]] \nThe meat of kakapo made good eating and was considered by M\u0101ori to be a delicacy<ref name=\"Tipa2006\"/> and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread.<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book |first1=Rod |last1=Morris |first2=Hal |last2=Smith |title=Wild South: Saving New Zealand's endangered birds |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand |year=1995}}</ref> One source states that its flesh \"resembles [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in taste and texture\",<ref name=\"MBL\"/> although European settlers have described the bird as having a \"strong and slightly stringent [sic] flavour\".<ref name=\"Tipa2006\"/>\n\nIn breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their [[Lek (mating arena)|mating arenas]] made it easy for M\u0101ori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather.

He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian cruiser Aurora]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Georgy Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our [[Common Era]].\n\n=== Exile ===\nWhile in Constantinople between 1920-21 Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] and became acquainted with [[Gurdjieff]], whom he had contact with in later years both at [[Fontainebleau]] and in [[Paris]]. Mouravieff and Ouspensky became close friends and worked together either in Paris or London for many years most notably on the manuscript of [[In Search of the Miraculous]]. They met for the last time at Lyne Place Manor <ref> https://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1931-1941-london-gadsden-lyne/lyne-place-house-and-history/</ref>, near London, in May 1937. Mouravieff detailed the nature of his relationship with both Ouspensky and Gurdjieff in an article published by [[Synthese]] in 1957 entitled Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of an Unknown Teaching <ref> Mouravieff, Boris (1997). Amis, Robin (ed) Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, ISBN 1-872-292-224 </ref>.\n\n=== In France ===\nMouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee in 1924. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance <ref> http://www.association-boris-mouravieff.com </ref> <ref> Mouravieff, Larissa. Boris Mouravieff Biography, Geneva University Archive </ref>.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights.

Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian cruiser Aurora]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Georgy Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our [[Common Era]].\n\n=== Exile ===\nWhile in Constantinople between 1920-21 Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] and became acquainted with [[Gurdjieff]], whom he had contact with in later years both at [[Fontainebleau]] and in [[Paris]]. Mouravieff and Ouspensky became close friends and worked together either in Paris or London for many years most notably on the manuscript of [[In Search of the Miraculous]]. They met for the last time at Lyne Place Manor <ref> https://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1931-1941-london-gadsden-lyne/lyne-place-house-and-history/</ref>, near London, in May 1937. Mouravieff detailed the nature of his relationship with both Ouspensky and Gurdjieff in an article published by [[Synthese]] in 1957 entitled Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of an Unknown Teaching <ref> Mouravieff, Boris (1997). Amis, Robin (ed) Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, ISBN 1-872-292-224 </ref>.\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

The second process is '''systems consolidation''', where [[Declarative memory|hippocampus-dependent]] memories become independent of the [[hippocampus]] over a period of weeks to years and occurs on a much larger scale in the brain.  Recently, a third process has become the focus of research, '''reconsolidation''', in which previously consolidated memories can be made [[Lability|labile]] again through reactivation of the memory trace.\n[[File:Memory consolidation.svg|alt=position of consolidation to the information-to-memory process|thumb|575x575px|The line processes to make information memory]]\n\n== History ==\nMemory consolidation was first referred to in the writings of the renowned [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] teacher of [[rhetoric]] [[Quintillian]].  He noted the \"curious fact... that the interval of a single night will greatly increase the strength of the memory,\" and presented the possibility that \"... the power of recollection .. undergoes a process of ripening and maturing during the time which intervenes.\"  The process of consolidation was later proposed based on clinical data illustrated in 1882 by [[Th\u00e9odule-Armand Ribot|Ribot's]] [[Law of Regression]], \"progressive destruction advances progressively from the unstable to the stable\". This idea was elaborated on by William H. Burnham a few years later in a paper on amnesia integrating findings from experimental psychology and neurology.  Coining of the term \"consolidation\" is credited to the German researchers [[Georg Elias M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]] and Alfons Pilzecker who rediscovered the concept that memory takes time to fixate or undergo \"Konsolidierung\" in their studies conducted between 1892 and 1900.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> The two proposed the perseveration-consolidation [[hypothesis]] after they found that new information learned could disrupt information previously learnt if not enough time had passed to allow the old information to be consolidated.<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh>{{Cite journal | last1 = McGaugh | first1 = J.

Meanwhile, [[Neuropsychopharmacology|neuropharmacological]] studies of selected brain areas began to shed light on the [[molecules]] possibly responsible for fast consolidation.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> In recent decades, advancements in [[cell (biology)|cellular]] preparations, [[molecular biology]], and [[neurogenetics]] have revolutionized the study of consolidation. Providing additional support is the study of functional brain activity in humans which has revealed that the activity of brain regions changes over time after a new memory is acquired.<ref name=ScovilleMilner/> This change can occur as quickly as a couple hours after the memory has been [[encoded]] suggesting that there is a [[Time|temporal]] dimension to the reorganization of the memory as it is represented in the [[brain]].<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh/>\n\n== Synaptic consolidation ==\n[[Synapse|Synaptic consolidation]], or [[long-term potentiation#Late phase|late-phase LTP]],<ref name=\"Bramham 2005\"/> is one form of memory consolidation seen across all species and long-term memory tasks. [[Long-term memory]], when discussed in the context of synaptic consolidation, is [[memory]] that lasts for at least 24 hours. An exception to this 24-hour rule is [[long-term potentiation]], or LTP, a model of [[synaptic plasticity]] related to [[learning]], in which an hour is thought to be sufficient. Synaptic consolidation is achieved faster than systems consolidation, within only minutes to hours of learning in goldfish.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> LTP, one of the best understood forms of [[synaptic plasticity]], is thought to be a possible underlying process in synaptic consolidation.\n\n=== Standard model ===\nThe standard model of synaptic consolidation suggests that alterations of synaptic [[protein synthesis]] and changes in [[membrane potential]] are achieved through activating [[Signal transduction|intracellular transduction cascades]]. These molecular cascades trigger [[transcription factors]] that lead to changes in [[gene expression]]. The result of the gene expression is the lasting alteration of synaptic proteins, as well as synaptic remodeling and growth. In a short time-frame immediately following learning, the molecular cascade, expression and process of both transcription factors and [[immediate early genes]], are susceptible to disruptions.  Disruptions caused by specific drugs, antibodies and gross physical trauma can block the effects of synaptic consolidation.<ref name=\"Dudai\" />\n\n=== Long-term potentiation ===\n{{Main article|Long-term potentiation}}\nLTP can be thought of as the prolonged strengthening of [[synaptic transmission]],<ref name=\"Tronson\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Tronson | first1 = N.

The process of [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] is regarded as a contributing factor to [[synaptic plasticity]] and in the growth of [[synaptic strength]], which are suggested to underlie memory formation. LTP is also considered to be an important mechanism in terms of maintaining memories within brain regions,<ref name=\"Spencer\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = J. P.

There is evidence to suggest that synaptic consolidation takes place within minutes to hours of [[memory encoding]] or [[learning]], and as such is considered the 'fast' type of consolidation.<ref name=\"Dudai\"/> As soon as six hours after training, memories become impervious to interferences that disrupt synaptic consolidation and the formation of long-term memory.\n\n=== Spacing effect ===\n''See also: [[Spacing effect]]''\n\n[[Distributed learning]] has been found to enhance memory consolidation, specifically for relational memory. Experimental results suggest that distributing learning over the course of 24 hours decreases the rate of forgetting compared to [[spacing effect|massed learning]], and enhances relational memory consolidation. When interpreted in the context of synaptic consolidation, mechanisms of synaptic strengthening may depend on the spacing of memory reactivation to allow sufficient time for [[protein synthesis]] to occur, and thereby strengthen long-term memory.<ref name=\"Litman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Litman | first1 = L. | last2 = Davachi | first2 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Distributed learning enhances relational memory consolidation | url = | journal = Learn.

M., & Rothkopf, E. Z. (1984). Contextual enrichment and distribution of practice in the classroom. Cognition and Instruction, 1(3), 341-358.</ref> In this experiment, subjects were sorted into three groups to test retention and learning. \"Each group was taught the same 8 hour statistics class, but one group was taught the class in one day, the next over the course of four days in one room, and the last was taught the class over the course of four days in different rooms. The subjects were tested five days later in a completely new setting. The results of the experiment were that taking the class over a period of four days was much more effective than taking it in one single mass. Interestingly, the group that took the course over four days and in different rooms performed the best in the final retention test out of all the groups.\"<ref>Smith, S. M., & Rothkopf, E. Z. (1984). Contextual enrichment and distribution of practice in the classroom. ''Cognition and Instruction'', ''1''(3), 341-358.</ref>  This shows that spacing out study sessions and studying in different environments helps with retention as it provides time for the brain to consolidate the information without being interrupted by new information. The benefits of spacing were also demonstrated in an earlier study by Reder and Anderson (1982) which yielded similar results, confirming the spacing effect\u2019s relevance and effects on learning.<ref>Reder, L.

Bruce, 1941- (2015). ''Cognitive psychology : connecting mind, research and everyday experience'' (4th edition ed.). New york: Cengage learning.</ref>\n\n=== Protein synthesis ===\n[[Protein synthesis]] plays an important role in the formation of new [[memories]]. Studies have shown that [[protein synthesis inhibitor]]s administered after [[learning]], weaken memory, suggesting that protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation. Additionally, reports have suggested that the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors also inhibit [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]].<ref name=\"Gold\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Gold | first1 = P. E. | title = Protein synthesis inhibition and memory: Formation vs amnesia | doi = 10.1016/j.nlm.2007.10.006 | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 201\u2013211 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18054504| pmc =2346577 }}</ref> However, other results have shown that protein synthesis may not in fact be necessary for memory consolidation, as it has been found that the formation of memories can withstand vast amounts of [[Protein synthesis inhibitor|protein synthesis inhibition]], suggesting that this criterion of protein synthesis as necessary for memory consolidation is not unconditional.<ref name=\"Gold\"/>\n\n== Systems consolidation ==\nSystems consolidation is the second form of [[memory]] consolidation. It is a reorganization process in which memories from the [[hippocampal]] region, where memories are first [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], are moved to the [[neo-cortex]] in a more permanent form of storage.<ref name=\"Roediger\">Roediger, H. L., Dudai, Y., & Fitzpatrick, S. M. (2007). Science of memory: concepts. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</ref> Systems consolidation is a slow dynamic process that can take from one to two decades to be fully formed in humans, unlike synaptic consolidation that only takes minutes to hours for new information to stabilize into memories.<ref name=\"Roediger\" />\n\n=== Standard model ===\nThe standard model of systems consolidation has been summarized by Squire and Alvarez (1995);<ref name=\"Squire 1995\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Squire | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Alvarez | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1016/0959-4388(95)80023-9 | title = Retrograde amnesia and memory consolidation: A neurobiological perspective | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 169\u2013177 | year = 1995 | pmid =  7620304| pmc = }}</ref> it states that when novel information is originally [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]] and registered, memory of these new [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] becomes retained in both the [[hippocampus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions.<ref name=\"Frankland\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Frankland | first1 = P. W. | last2 = Bontempi | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1038/nrn1607 | title = The organization of recent and remote memories | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 119\u2013130 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15685217| pmc = }}</ref> Later the hippocampus' representations of this information become active in [[explicit memory|explicit]] (conscious) recall or [[implicit memory|implicit]] (unconscious) recall like in [[sleep]] and 'offline' processes.<ref name=\"Dudai\" />\n\nMemory is retained in the [[hippocampus]] for up to one week after initial [[learning]], representing the hippocampus-dependent stage.<ref name=\"Frankland\" /> During this stage the hippocampus is 'teaching' the cortex more and more about the information and when the information is recalled it strengthens the cortico-cortical connection thus making the memory hippocampus-independent.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> Therefore, from one week and beyond the initial [[training]] experience, the memory is slowly transferred to the [[neo-cortex]] where it becomes permanently stored.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> In this view the hippocampus can perform the task of storing memories temporarily because the synapses are able to change quickly whereas the neocortical synapses change over time.<ref name=\"Squire 1995\"/> Consolidation is thus the process whereby the hippocampus activates the neocortex continually leading to strong connections between the two. Since the hippocampus can only support memories temporarily the remaining activation will be seen only in the neocortex which is able to support memory indefinitely. Squire and Alvarez took the temporally graded nature of patients with retrograde amnesia as support for the notion that once a connection has been established within the neocortex the hippocampus is no longer required, but this process is dynamic and extends for several years.\n\nSquire and Alvarez also proposed the idea that MTL structures play a role in the consolidation of memories within the neocortex by providing a [[binding problem|binding]] area for multiple [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[regions]] involved in the initial encoding of the memory.<ref name=\"Squire 1995\"/> In this sense the MTL would act as a relay station for the various perceptual input that make up a memory and stores it as a whole event. After this has occurred the MTL directs information towards the neocortex to provide a permanent representation of the memory.\n\n===Multiple trace theory===\n[[Multiple trace theory]] (MTT) builds on the distinction between [[semantic memory]] and [[episodic memory]] and addresses perceived shortcomings of the standard model with respect to the dependency of the hippocampus. MTT argues that the hippocampus is always involved in the retrieval and storage of episodic memories.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nadel | first1 = L. | last2 = Moscovitch | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/S0959-4388(97)80010-4 | title = Memory consolidation, retrograde amnesia and the hippocampal complex | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 217\u2013227 | year = 1997 | pmid =  9142752| pmc = }}</ref> It is thought that semantic memories, including basic information encoded during the storage of episodic memories, can be established in structures apart from the hippocampal system such as the neo-cortex in the process of consolidation.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Hence, while proper hippocampal functioning is necessary for the retention and retrieval of episodic memories, it is less necessary during the encoding and use of semantic memories. As memories age there are long-term interactions between the hippocampus and neo-cortex and this leads to the establishment of aspects of memory within structures aside from the hippocampus.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> MTT thus states that both episodic and semantic memories rely on the hippocampus and the latter becomes somewhat independent of the hippocampus during consolidation.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> \nAn important distinction between MTT and the standard model is that the standard model proposes that all memories become independent of the hippocampus after several years. However, Nadel and Moscovitch have shown that the hippocampus was involved in memory recall for all remote [[autobiographical]] memories no matter of their age.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> An important point they make while interpreting the results is that activation in the hippocampus was equally as strong regardless of the fact that the memories recalled were as old as 45 years prior to the date of the experiment.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> This is complicated by the fact that the hippocampus is constantly involved in the encoding of new events and activation due to this fact is hard to separate using baseline measures.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Because of this, activation of the hippocampus during retrieval of distant memories may simply be a [[by-product]] of the subject encoding the study as an event.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/>\n\n====Criticisms====\nHaist, Gore, and Mao, sought to examine the temporal nature of consolidation within the hippocampus to test MTT against the standard view.<ref name=Haist/> They found that the hippocampus does not substantially contribute to the recollection of remote memories after a period of a few years. They claim that advances in the functional magnetic resonance imaging have allowed them to improve their distinction between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which they claim is more enduring in its activation from remote memory retrieval.<ref name=Haist>{{Cite journal | last1 = Haist | first1 = F. | last2 = Bowden Gore | first2 = J.

When episodic information is encoded there are semantic aspects of the memory that are encoded as well and this is proposed as an explanation of the varying gradients of memory loss seen in amnesic patients.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Amnesic patients with hippocampal damage show traces of memories and this has been used as support for the standard model because it suggests that memories are retained apart from the hippocampal system.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Nadel and Moscovitch argue that these retained memories have lost the richness of experience and exist as depersonalized events that have been semanticized over time.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> They suggest that this instead provides support for their notion that episodic memories rely significantly on the hippocampal system but semantic memories can be established elsewhere in the brain and survive hippocampal damage.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/>\n\n=== Declarative vs. procedural knowledge consolidation===\nLearning can be distinguished by two forms of knowledge: [[declarative memory|declarative]] and [[procedural memory|procedural]]. Declarative information includes the [[conscious]] recall of facts, episodes, and lists, and its storage typically connected with the MTL and the hippocampal systems as it includes the encoding of both semantic and episodic information of events. Procedural knowledge however has been said to function separate from this system as it relies primarily on motor areas of the brain.<ref name=Squire>{{Cite journal | last1 = Squire | first1 = L. R. | title = Mechanisms of memory | doi = 10.1126/science.3086978 | journal = Science | volume = 232 | issue = 4758 | pages = 1612\u20131619 | year = 1986 | pmid =  3086978| pmc = }}</ref> The implicit nature of procedural knowledge allows it to exist absent from the conscious awareness that the information is there. Amnesic patients have shown retained ability to be trained on tasks and exhibit learning without the subject being aware that the training had ever taken place.<ref name=\"Squire\" /> This introduces a dissociation between the two forms of memory and the fact that one form can exist absent the other suggests separate mechanisms are involved in consolidation. Squire has proposed the procedural knowledge is consolidated in some cases by the extrapyramidal motor system.<ref name=\"Squire\" /> Squire demonstrated that intact learning of certain motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills can be retained in patients with amnesia.<ref name=\"Squire\" /> They also retain the ability to be influenced by priming effects without the patients being able to consciously recall any training session occurring.<ref name=\"Squire\" />\n\n===Emotional and stressful memory consolidation===\nThe [[amygdala]], specifically the [[basolateral amygdala|basolateral region]] (BLA) is involved in the encoding of significant experiences and has been directly linked to memorable events.<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh/> Extensive evidence suggests that stress hormones such as epinephrine play a critical role in consolidating new memories and this is why stressful memories are recalled vividly.<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh2>{{Cite journal | last1 = McGaugh | first1 = J.

Once memories undergo the process of consolidation and become part of long-term memory, they are thought of as stable. However, the retrieval of a [[memory trace]] can cause another [[labile]] phase that then requires an active process to make the [[memory]] stable after retrieval is complete.<ref name=\"Tronson\" />  It is believed that post-retrieval stabilization is different and distinct from consolidation, despite its overlap in function (e.g. [[Storage (memory)|storage]]) and its mechanisms (e.g. [[protein synthesis]]). Memory modification needs to be demonstrated in the retrieval in order for this independent process to be valid.<ref name=\"Tronson\" />\n\n=== History ===\nThe theory of reconsolidation has been debated for many years and is still controversial. Reconsolidation was first conceptualized in light of the discovery that [[phobias]] could often be eliminated by means of [[electroconvulsive shock therapy]] (ECT){{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. This seemed to indicate the involvement of a re-consolidation process for excited memories, and that the operation active in ECT was the disruption of that process; here, of the reconsolidation of retrieved fear memories by shock administration.\n\nFurther studies investigated the concept,<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> using ECT to test for reconsolidation; ECT was already known as an [[amnesic]] agent (leads to memory loss). These studies found it to be effective on retrieved memories when administered directly after the retrieval of a memory.<ref name=\"Dudai\" />\n\nLater research, wherein fear memories had been established in rats through [[Pavlovian]] [[fear conditioning]], found that a consolidated fear memory can be brought to a [[labile]] state, by means of immediate [[amygdala]] infusions of the [[protein synthesis]] inhibitor [[anisomycin]], but not by infusions made six hours afterwards.<ref name=\"Nader\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nader | first1 = K. | last2 = Schafe | first2 = G.

Groups of rats were then injected with anisomycin, an antibiotic that restricts protein synthesis, at different points in time. The rats that were injected with anisomycin after consolidation had taken place, retained the fear reaction to the tone. However, the rats that were injected before consolidation and reconsolidation could take place, did not retain the fear response when they heard the tone again later. It seems that interference that is made before memories are consolidated affect the way they are remembered later. \n\nBrunet and colleagues (2008) studied patients that had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ([[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]). <ref>Brunet, A., Orr, S.

''Journal of psychiatric research'', ''42''(6), 503-506.</ref> Following the same method that Nader and his associates used, Brunet induced anxiety responses in the patients by having them listen to a 30 second recording describing the circumstances of their traumatic experiences. The patients were shortly thereafter injected with propranolol, a drug that blocks stress hormone receptors in the amygdala which is implicated in neurologically representing the emotional content of memories. These patients experienced a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms months after treatment. These findings were confirmed in later studies done in 2009 by Kindt and colleagues and in 2010 by Schiller and colleagues . <ref>Kindt, M., Soeter, M., & Vervliet, B. (2009).

However the need for standardized methods was underscored as in some learning tasks such as [[fear conditioning]], certain forms of memory reactivation could actually represent new [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] [[learning]] rather than activation of an old [[memory trace]].  Under this possibility, traditional disruptions of reconsolidation might actually maintain the original memory trace but preventing the consolidation of [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] [[learning]].<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> Recent work has suggested that [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications may also prevent reconsolidation in some cases.<ref name=\"HDAC\">{{cite journal |author1=Gr\u00e4ff J |author2=Joseph NF |author3=Horn ME |author4=Samiei A |author5=Meng J |author6=Seo J |author7=Rei D |author8=Bero AW |author9=Phan TX |author10=Wagner F |author11=Holson E |author12=Xu J |author13=Sun J |author14=Neve RL |author15=Mach RH |author16=Haggarty SJ |author17=Tsai LH. | title = Epigenetic priming of memory updating during reconsolidation to attenuate remote fear memories. | journal = Cell | volume = 156 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 261\u2013276 |date= Jan 2014 | pmid = 24439381 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.020 | pmc=3986862}}</ref> The removal of these epigenetic modifications with inhibitors of [[histone deacetylase]] enabled the erasure of remote memories after recall.\n\nReconsolidation [[experiment]]s are more difficult to run than typical consolidation experiments as disruption of a previously consolidated memory must be shown to be specific to the reactivation of the original [[memory trace]].  Furthermore, it is important to demonstrate that the [[vulnerability]] of reactivation occurs in a limited time frame, which can be assessed by delaying [[Infusion pump|infusion]] till six hours after reactivation.  It is also useful to show that the [[behavioral]] measure used to assess disruption of [[memory]] is not just due to task impairment caused by the procedure, which can be demonstrated by testing control groups in absence of the original [[learning]].  Finally, it is important to rule out alternative explanations, such as [[extinction]] [[learning]] by lengthening the reactivation phase.<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> There have also been concerns about the use of reconsolidation research to justify psychotherapy treatments, and the generalizability of basic reconsolidation research into the therapy room<ref>Patihis, L.

Both consolidation and reconsolidation can be disrupted by pharmacological agents (e.g. the [[translation (genetics)|protein synthesis]] inhibitor [[anisomycin]]) and both require the [[transcription factor]] [[CREB]]. However, recent amygdala research suggests that [[BDNF]] is required for consolidation (but not reconsolidation) whereas the [[transcription factor]] and [[Immediate early genes|immediate early gene]] [[Zif268]] is required for reconsolidation but not consolidation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Debiec | first1 = J. | last2 = Doyere | first2 = V. | last3 = Nader | first3 = K. | last4 = LeDoux | first4 = J.E. | year = 2006 | title = Directly reactivated, but not indirectly reactivated, memories undergo reconsolidation in the amygdala | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 103 | issue = 9| pages = 3428\u20133433 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0507168103| pmid = 16492789 | pmc = 1413871 }}</ref>  A similar [[double dissociation]] between [[Zif268]] for reconsolidation and [[BDNF]] for consolidation was found in the [[hippocampus]] for [[fear conditioning]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J.

He noted the \"curious fact... that the interval of a single night will greatly increase the strength of the memory,\" and presented the possibility that \"... the power of recollection .. undergoes a process of ripening and maturing during the time which intervenes.\"  The process of consolidation was later proposed based on clinical data illustrated in 1882 by [[Th\u00e9odule-Armand Ribot|Ribot's]] [[Law of Regression]], \"progressive destruction advances progressively from the unstable to the stable\". This idea was elaborated on by William H. Burnham a few years later in a paper on amnesia integrating findings from experimental psychology and neurology.  Coining of the term \"consolidation\" is credited to the German researchers [[Georg Elias M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]] and Alfons Pilzecker who rediscovered the concept that memory takes time to fixate or undergo \"Konsolidierung\" in their studies conducted between 1892 and 1900.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> The two proposed the perseveration-consolidation [[hypothesis]] after they found that new information learned could disrupt information previously learnt if not enough time had passed to allow the old information to be consolidated.<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh>{{Cite journal | last1 = McGaugh | first1 = J.

Meanwhile, [[Neuropsychopharmacology|neuropharmacological]] studies of selected brain areas began to shed light on the [[molecules]] possibly responsible for fast consolidation.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> In recent decades, advancements in [[cell (biology)|cellular]] preparations, [[molecular biology]], and [[neurogenetics]] have revolutionized the study of consolidation. Providing additional support is the study of functional brain activity in humans which has revealed that the activity of brain regions changes over time after a new memory is acquired.<ref name=ScovilleMilner/> This change can occur as quickly as a couple hours after the memory has been [[encoded]] suggesting that there is a [[Time|temporal]] dimension to the reorganization of the memory as it is represented in the [[brain]].<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh/>\n\n== Synaptic consolidation ==\n[[Synapse|Synaptic consolidation]], or [[long-term potentiation#Late phase|late-phase LTP]],<ref name=\"Bramham 2005\"/> is one form of memory consolidation seen across all species and long-term memory tasks. [[Long-term memory]], when discussed in the context of synaptic consolidation, is [[memory]] that lasts for at least 24 hours. An exception to this 24-hour rule is [[long-term potentiation]], or LTP, a model of [[synaptic plasticity]] related to [[learning]], in which an hour is thought to be sufficient. Synaptic consolidation is achieved faster than systems consolidation, within only minutes to hours of learning in goldfish.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> LTP, one of the best understood forms of [[synaptic plasticity]], is thought to be a possible underlying process in synaptic consolidation.\n\n=== Standard model ===\nThe standard model of synaptic consolidation suggests that alterations of synaptic [[protein synthesis]] and changes in [[membrane potential]] are achieved through activating [[Signal transduction|intracellular transduction cascades]]. These molecular cascades trigger [[transcription factors]] that lead to changes in [[gene expression]]. The result of the gene expression is the lasting alteration of synaptic proteins, as well as synaptic remodeling and growth. In a short time-frame immediately following learning, the molecular cascade, expression and process of both transcription factors and [[immediate early genes]], are susceptible to disruptions.  Disruptions caused by specific drugs, antibodies and gross physical trauma can block the effects of synaptic consolidation.<ref name=\"Dudai\" />\n\n=== Long-term potentiation ===\n{{Main article|Long-term potentiation}}\nLTP can be thought of as the prolonged strengthening of [[synaptic transmission]],<ref name=\"Tronson\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Tronson | first1 = N.

The process of [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] is regarded as a contributing factor to [[synaptic plasticity]] and in the growth of [[synaptic strength]], which are suggested to underlie memory formation. LTP is also considered to be an important mechanism in terms of maintaining memories within brain regions,<ref name=\"Spencer\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = J. P.

Specifically, [[NMDA-receptor]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] appear to block the induction of both LTP and [[fear conditioning]] and that fear conditioning increases [[amygdala|amygdaloidal]] synaptic transmission that would result in LTP.<ref name=\"Maren\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Maren | first1 = S. | title = Long-term potentiation in the amygdala: A mechanism for emotional learning and memory | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01465-4 | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 561\u2013567 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10542437| pmc = | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/56238/1/marenTINS99.pdf | hdl = 2027.42/56238 }}</ref>\n\n=== Timeline of consolidation ===\nSynaptic consolidation, when compared to systems consolidation (which is said to take weeks to months to years to be accomplished), is considerably faster. There is evidence to suggest that synaptic consolidation takes place within minutes to hours of [[memory encoding]] or [[learning]], and as such is considered the 'fast' type of consolidation.<ref name=\"Dudai\"/> As soon as six hours after training, memories become impervious to interferences that disrupt synaptic consolidation and the formation of long-term memory.\n\n=== Spacing effect ===\n[[Distributed learning]] has been found to enhance memory consolidation, specifically for relational memory. Experimental results suggest that distributing learning over the course of 24 hours decreases the rate of forgetting compared to [[spacing effect|massed learning]], and enhances relational memory consolidation. When interpreted in the context of synaptic consolidation, mechanisms of synaptic strengthening may depend on the spacing of memory reactivation to allow sufficient time for [[protein synthesis]] to occur, and thereby strengthen long-term memory.<ref name=\"Litman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Litman | first1 = L. | last2 = Davachi | first2 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Distributed learning enhances relational memory consolidation | url = | journal = Learn.

Rothkopf.<ref>Smith, S. M., & Rothkopf, E. Z. (1984). Contextual enrichment and distribution of practice in the classroom. ''Cognition and Instruction'', ''1''(3), 341-358.</ref> In this experiment, subjects were sorted into three groups to test retention and learning. Each group was taught the same 8hr statistics course, but one group was taught the course in one day, the next over the course of four days in one room, and the last was taught the course over the course of four days in different rooms. The subjects were tested five days later in a completely new setting. The results of the experiment were that taking the class over a period of four days was much more effective than taking it in one single mass. Interestingly, the group that took the course over four days and in different rooms performed the best in the final retention test out of all the groups. This shows that spacing out your studies and studying in different environments helps with retention as it provides time for the brain to consolidate the information without being interrupted by new information. This was also shown to be the case in an earlier study done in 1982 by Lynne M. Reder and John R. Anderson which yielded similar results, confirming the spacing effect\u2019s relevance and effects on learning.<ref>Reder, L. M., & Anderson, J. R. (1982).

New york: Cengage learning.</ref>\n\n=== Protein synthesis ===\n[[Protein synthesis]] plays an important role in the formation of new [[memories]]. Studies have shown that [[protein synthesis inhibitor]]s administered after [[learning]], weaken memory, suggesting that protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation. Additionally, reports have suggested that the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors also inhibit [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]].<ref name=\"Gold\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Gold | first1 = P. E. | title = Protein synthesis inhibition and memory: Formation vs amnesia | doi = 10.1016/j.nlm.2007.10.006 | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 201\u2013211 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18054504| pmc =2346577 }}</ref> However, other results have shown that protein synthesis may not in fact be necessary for memory consolidation, as it has been found that the formation of memories can withstand vast amounts of [[Protein synthesis inhibitor|protein synthesis inhibition]], suggesting that this criterion of protein synthesis as necessary for memory consolidation is not unconditional.<ref name=\"Gold\"/>\n\n== Systems consolidation ==\nSystems consolidation is the second form of [[memory]] consolidation. It is a reorganization process in which memories from the [[hippocampal]] region, where memories are first [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], are moved to the [[neo-cortex]] in a more permanent form of storage.<ref name=\"Roediger\">Roediger, H. L., Dudai, Y., & Fitzpatrick, S. M. (2007). Science of memory: concepts. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</ref> Systems consolidation is a slow dynamic process that can take from one to two decades to be fully formed in humans, unlike synaptic consolidation that only takes minutes to hours for new information to stabilize into memories.<ref name=\"Roediger\" />\n\n=== Standard model ===\nThe standard model of systems consolidation has been summarized by Squire and Alvarez (1995);<ref name=\"Squire 1995\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Squire | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Alvarez | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1016/0959-4388(95)80023-9 | title = Retrograde amnesia and memory consolidation: A neurobiological perspective | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 169\u2013177 | year = 1995 | pmid =  7620304| pmc = }}</ref> it states that when novel information is originally [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]] and registered, memory of these new [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] becomes retained in both the [[hippocampus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions.<ref name=\"Frankland\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Frankland | first1 = P. W. | last2 = Bontempi | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1038/nrn1607 | title = The organization of recent and remote memories | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 119\u2013130 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15685217| pmc = }}</ref> Later the hippocampus' representations of this information become active in [[explicit memory|explicit]] (conscious) recall or [[implicit memory|implicit]] (unconscious) recall like in [[sleep]] and 'offline' processes.<ref name=\"Dudai\" />\n\nMemory is retained in the [[hippocampus]] for up to one week after initial [[learning]], representing the hippocampus-dependent stage.<ref name=\"Frankland\" /> During this stage the hippocampus is 'teaching' the cortex more and more about the information and when the information is recalled it strengthens the cortico-cortical connection thus making the memory hippocampus-independent.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> Therefore, from one week and beyond the initial [[training]] experience, the memory is slowly transferred to the [[neo-cortex]] where it becomes permanently stored.<ref name=\"Dudai\" /> In this view the hippocampus can perform the task of storing memories temporarily because the synapses are able to change quickly whereas the neocortical synapses change over time.<ref name=\"Squire 1995\"/> Consolidation is thus the process whereby the hippocampus activates the neocortex continually leading to strong connections between the two. Since the hippocampus can only support memories temporarily the remaining activation will be seen only in the neocortex which is able to support memory indefinitely. Squire and Alvarez took the temporally graded nature of patients with retrograde amnesia as support for the notion that once a connection has been established within the neocortex the hippocampus is no longer required, but this process is dynamic and extends for several years.\n\nSquire and Alvarez also proposed the idea that MTL structures play a role in the consolidation of memories within the neocortex by providing a [[binding problem|binding]] area for multiple [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[regions]] involved in the initial encoding of the memory.<ref name=\"Squire 1995\"/> In this sense the MTL would act as a relay station for the various perceptual input that make up a memory and stores it as a whole event. After this has occurred the MTL directs information towards the neocortex to provide a permanent representation of the memory.\n\n===Multiple trace theory===\n[[Multiple trace theory]] (MTT) builds on the distinction between [[semantic memory]] and [[episodic memory]] and addresses perceived shortcomings of the standard model with respect to the dependency of the hippocampus. MTT argues that the hippocampus is always involved in the retrieval and storage of episodic memories.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nadel | first1 = L. | last2 = Moscovitch | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/S0959-4388(97)80010-4 | title = Memory consolidation, retrograde amnesia and the hippocampal complex | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 217\u2013227 | year = 1997 | pmid =  9142752| pmc = }}</ref> It is thought that semantic memories, including basic information encoded during the storage of episodic memories, can be established in structures apart from the hippocampal system such as the neo-cortex in the process of consolidation.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Hence, while proper hippocampal functioning is necessary for the retention and retrieval of episodic memories, it is less necessary during the encoding and use of semantic memories. As memories age there are long-term interactions between the hippocampus and neo-cortex and this leads to the establishment of aspects of memory within structures aside from the hippocampus.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> MTT thus states that both episodic and semantic memories rely on the hippocampus and the latter becomes somewhat independent of the hippocampus during consolidation.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> \nAn important distinction between MTT and the standard model is that the standard model proposes that all memories become independent of the hippocampus after several years. However, Nadel and Moscovitch have shown that the hippocampus was involved in memory recall for all remote [[autobiographical]] memories no matter of their age.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> An important point they make while interpreting the results is that activation in the hippocampus was equally as strong regardless of the fact that the memories recalled were as old as 45 years prior to the date of the experiment.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> This is complicated by the fact that the hippocampus is constantly involved in the encoding of new events and activation due to this fact is hard to separate using baseline measures.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Because of this, activation of the hippocampus during retrieval of distant memories may simply be a [[by-product]] of the subject encoding the study as an event.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/>\n\n====Criticisms====\nHaist, Gore, and Mao, sought to examine the temporal nature of consolidation within the hippocampus to test MTT against the standard view.<ref name=Haist/> They found that the hippocampus does not substantially contribute to the recollection of remote memories after a period of a few years. They claim that advances in the functional magnetic resonance imaging have allowed them to improve their distinction between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which they claim is more enduring in its activation from remote memory retrieval.<ref name=Haist>{{Cite journal | last1 = Haist | first1 = F. | last2 = Bowden Gore | first2 = J.

When episodic information is encoded there are semantic aspects of the memory that are encoded as well and this is proposed as an explanation of the varying gradients of memory loss seen in amnesic patients.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Amnesic patients with hippocampal damage show traces of memories and this has been used as support for the standard model because it suggests that memories are retained apart from the hippocampal system.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> Nadel and Moscovitch argue that these retained memories have lost the richness of experience and exist as depersonalized events that have been semanticized over time.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/> They suggest that this instead provides support for their notion that episodic memories rely significantly on the hippocampal system but semantic memories can be established elsewhere in the brain and survive hippocampal damage.<ref name=NadelMoscovitch/>\n\n=== Declarative vs. procedural knowledge consolidation===\nLearning can be distinguished by two forms of knowledge: [[declarative memory|declarative]] and [[procedural memory|procedural]]. Declarative information includes the [[conscious]] recall of facts, episodes, and lists, and its storage typically connected with the MTL and the hippocampal systems as it includes the encoding of both semantic and episodic information of events. Procedural knowledge however has been said to function separate from this system as it relies primarily on motor areas of the brain.<ref name=Squire>{{Cite journal | last1 = Squire | first1 = L. R. | title = Mechanisms of memory | doi = 10.1126/science.3086978 | journal = Science | volume = 232 | issue = 4758 | pages = 1612\u20131619 | year = 1986 | pmid =  3086978| pmc = }}</ref> The implicit nature of procedural knowledge allows it to exist absent from the conscious awareness that the information is there. Amnesic patients have shown retained ability to be trained on tasks and exhibit learning without the subject being aware that the training had ever taken place.<ref name=\"Squire\" /> This introduces a dissociation between the two forms of memory and the fact that one form can exist absent the other suggests separate mechanisms are involved in consolidation. Squire has proposed the procedural knowledge is consolidated in some cases by the extrapyramidal motor system.<ref name=\"Squire\" /> Squire demonstrated that intact learning of certain motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills can be retained in patients with amnesia.<ref name=\"Squire\" /> They also retain the ability to be influenced by priming effects without the patients being able to consciously recall any training session occurring.<ref name=\"Squire\" />\n\n===Emotional and stressful memory consolidation===\nThe [[amygdala]], specifically the [[basolateral amygdala|basolateral region]] (BLA) is involved in the encoding of significant experiences and has been directly linked to memorable events.<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh/> Extensive evidence suggests that stress hormones such as epinephrine play a critical role in consolidating new memories and this is why stressful memories are recalled vividly.<ref name=JamesLMcGaugh2>{{Cite journal | last1 = McGaugh | first1 = J.

However, the retrieval of a [[memory trace]] can cause another [[labile]] phase that then requires an active process to make the [[memory]] stable after retrieval is complete.<ref name=\"Tronson\" />  It is believed that post-retrieval stabilization is different and distinct from consolidation, despite its overlap in function (e.g. [[Storage (memory)|storage]]) and its mechanisms (e.g. [[protein synthesis]]). Memory modification needs to be demonstrated in the retrieval in order for this independent process to be valid.<ref name=\"Tronson\" />\n\n=== History ===\nThe theory of reconsolidation has been debated for many years and is still controversial. Reconsolidation was first conceptualized in light of the discovery that [[phobias]] could often be eliminated by means of [[electroconvulsive shock therapy]] (ECT){{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. This seemed to indicate the involvement of a re-consolidation process for excited memories, and that the operation active in ECT was the disruption of that process; here, of the reconsolidation of retrieved fear memories by shock administration.\n\nFurther studies investigated the concept,<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> using ECT to test for reconsolidation; ECT was already known as an [[amnesic]] agent (leads to memory loss). These studies found it to be effective on retrieved memories when administered directly after the retrieval of a memory.<ref name=\"Dudai\" />\n\nLater research, wherein fear memories had been established in rats through [[Pavlovian]] [[fear conditioning]], found that a consolidated fear memory can be brought to a [[labile]] state, by means of immediate [[amygdala]] infusions of the [[protein synthesis]] inhibitor [[anisomycin]], but not by infusions made six hours afterwards.<ref name=\"Nader\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nader | first1 = K. | last2 = Schafe | first2 = G.

Schafe, and Joseph E. Le Doux in 2000<ref>Nader, K., Schafe, G. & LeDoux, J. The labile nature of consolidation theory. Nat Rev Neurosci 1, 216\u2013219 (2000). <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1038/35044580</nowiki></ref> <ref>Goldstein, E. Bruce, 1941- (2015). Cognitive psychology : connecting mind, research and everyday experience (4th edition ed.). New york: Cengage learning.</ref>, they discovered that the reconsolidation process may make memories more malleable than previously believed. In this experiment, Nader and his colleagues trained rats to be afraid of a tone by pairing the tone with a small shock. Groups of rats were then injected with anisomycin, an antibiotic that restricts protein synthesis, at different points in time. The rats that were injected with anisomycin after consolidation had taken place, retained the fear reaction to the tone. However, the rats that were injected before consolidation and reconsolidation could take place, did not retain the fear response when they heard the tone again later. It seems that interference that is made before memories are consolidated effect the way they are remembered later. \n\nIn a study done on human subjects in 2008 by Alain Brunet and his colleagues on patients that had been diagnosed with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). <ref>Brunet, A., Orr, S.

Effect of post-retrieval propranolol on psychophysiologic responding during subsequent script-driven traumatic imagery in post-traumatic stress disorder. ''Journal of psychiatric research'', ''42''(6), 503-506.</ref> Following the same method that Nader and his associates used, Brunet induced anxiety responses in the patients by having them listen to a 30 second recording describing the circumstances of their traumatic experiences. The patients were shortly thereafter injected with propranolol, a drug that blocks stress hormone receptors in the amygdala where emotions are connected to memories. These patients experienced a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms months after treatment. These findings were confirmed in later studies done in 2009 and 2010 by different research groups. <ref>Kindt, M., Soeter, M., & Vervliet, B. (2009).

This allows the person to reprogram the way stimuli and experiences are received and responded to in the brain. \n\nIn addition to fear memories, appetitive memories are also prone to reconsolidation episodes, which can likewise be disrupted; namely, after local administration of a protein activity inhibitor.<ref name=\"drug memory\">{{cite journal|last=Crespo|first=J.A. |author2=St\u00f6ckl, P. |author3=Ueberall, F. |author4=Marcel, J. |author5=Saria, A.  |author6=Zernig, G.|title=Activation of PKCzeta and PKMzeta in the nucleus accumbens core is necessary for the retrieval, consolidation and reconsolidation of the drug memory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=February 2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030502|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e30502|pmid=22348011 |pmc=3277594}}</ref>\n\nSince those breakthrough studies were done, there have been several others to probe the theory of memory reconsolidation.

It is important to note that negative results may be examples of conditions where memories are not susceptible to a permanent disruption, thus a determining factor of reconsolidation.<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> After much debate and a detailed review of this field it had been concluded that reconsolidation was a real phenomenon.<ref name=\"Sara\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sara | first1 = SJ | year = 2000 | title = Retrieval and reconsolidation: toward a neurobiology of remembering | url = | journal = Learn.

However the need for standardized methods was underscored as in some learning tasks such as [[fear conditioning]], certain forms of memory reactivation could actually represent new [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] [[learning]] rather than activation of an old [[memory trace]].  Under this possibility, traditional disruptions of reconsolidation might actually maintain the original memory trace but preventing the consolidation of [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] [[learning]].<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> Recent work has suggested that [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications may also prevent reconsolidation in some cases.<ref name=\"HDAC\">{{cite journal |author1=Gr\u00e4ff J |author2=Joseph NF |author3=Horn ME |author4=Samiei A |author5=Meng J |author6=Seo J |author7=Rei D |author8=Bero AW |author9=Phan TX |author10=Wagner F |author11=Holson E |author12=Xu J |author13=Sun J |author14=Neve RL |author15=Mach RH |author16=Haggarty SJ |author17=Tsai LH. | title = Epigenetic priming of memory updating during reconsolidation to attenuate remote fear memories. | journal = Cell | volume = 156 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 261\u2013276 |date= Jan 2014 | pmid = 24439381 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.020 | pmc=3986862}}</ref> The removal of these epigenetic modifications with inhibitors of [[histone deacetylase]] enabled the erasure of remote memories after recall.\n\nReconsolidation [[experiment]]s are more difficult to run than typical consolidation experiments as disruption of a previously consolidated memory must be shown to be specific to the reactivation of the original [[memory trace]].  Furthermore, it is important to demonstrate that the [[vulnerability]] of reactivation occurs in a limited time frame, which can be assessed by delaying [[Infusion pump|infusion]] till six hours after reactivation.  It is also useful to show that the [[behavioral]] measure used to assess disruption of [[memory]] is not just due to task impairment caused by the procedure, which can be demonstrated by testing control groups in absence of the original [[learning]].  Finally, it is important to rule out alternative explanations, such as [[extinction]] [[learning]] by lengthening the reactivation phase.<ref name=\"Tronson\" /> There have also been concerns about the use of reconsolidation research to justify psychotherapy treatments, and the generalizability of basic reconsolidation research into the therapy room<ref>Patihis, L. (2015). Let's be skeptical about reconsolidation and emotional arousal in therapy. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 38.</ref>\n\n=== Distinctions from consolidation ===\nQuestions arose if reconsolidation was a unique process or merely another phase of consolidation.  Both consolidation and reconsolidation can be disrupted by pharmacological agents (e.g. the [[translation (genetics)|protein synthesis]] inhibitor [[anisomycin]]) and both require the [[transcription factor]] [[CREB]]. However, recent amygdala research suggests that [[BDNF]] is required for consolidation (but not reconsolidation) whereas the [[transcription factor]] and [[Immediate early genes|immediate early gene]] [[Zif268]] is required for reconsolidation but not consolidation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Debiec | first1 = J. | last2 = Doyere | first2 = V. | last3 = Nader | first3 = K. | last4 = LeDoux | first4 = J.E. | year = 2006 | title = Directly reactivated, but not indirectly reactivated, memories undergo reconsolidation in the amygdala | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 103 | issue = 9| pages = 3428\u20133433 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0507168103| pmid = 16492789 | pmc = 1413871 }}</ref>  A similar [[double dissociation]] between [[Zif268]] for reconsolidation and [[BDNF]] for consolidation was found in the [[hippocampus]] for [[fear conditioning]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J.
