This could be heard up to five miles away, and personnel working at the station had to wear ear defenders. After unexplained drops in the mass flow rate and motor driving current in number 3 and 5 gas circulators, the hot run tests were stopped and the gas circuit opened up. Severe mechanical damage to the blading and diffuser sections of the number 3 and 5 gas circulators was observed. Large sections of the diffusers had broken away, and extensive fatigue cracking was found in the outer tapering shell and central axial cone. Large pieces of the diffuser casing had entered the gas circulator blades and caused heavy impact damage, and large amounts of debris had been transported down the gas duct. The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs), which were provided to enable the performance of individual gas circulators to be \"trimmed,\" were found to be extensively damaged, and the rotor blades and outlet guide vanes also had extensive impact and fatigue damage. Large numbers of the nuts and bolts involved had been shaken loose.<ref>\"Investigations into the failure of gas circulators and circuit components at Hinkley Point nuclear power station\" Rizk, W and Seymour, D F Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, v179 1964 p627-703</ref>\n\nThe subsequent investigation determined that the noise was caused by interaction between the IGVs and the rotor blades. The sound pressure levels generated by this noise were high enough to cause rapid fatigue failure in gas circuit components, and major re-design of the gas circulators and associated components was required. The IGVs were scrapped and flow straighteners introduced to smooth the flow of gas into the gas circulator intakes. Much pioneering experimental laboratory work on resonance and sound pressure levels was performed at English Electric's Gas Turbine and Atomic Power Division (APD) facilities at Whetstone, Leicestershire, to support the redesign work, and instrumentation to measure stress and sound pressure levels in the gas circuit during testing was developed. The delay caused severe financial difficulties for the consortium and set the construction schedule back; the station began generating electricity two years late in 1965.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2005/12/06/pwaod_hinkley_feature.shtml|title=Hinkley A: 1965|work=BBC Somerset|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>\n\n== Turbine Failure ==\n\nThe importance of materials design and the understanding of [[grain boundaries]] was highlighted during the operation of Hinkley Point. In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point \u2018A\u2019 turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the burst disc and the shaft caused the adjacent disc to burst almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This is thought to be the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the burst discs were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper embrittled during slow furnace cooling after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the absence of cracks. A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, it was not possible to quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material\u2019s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions.<ref>Kalderon, D.

Large pieces of the diffuser casing had entered the gas circulator blades and caused heavy impact damage, and large amounts of debris had been transported down the gas duct. The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs), which were provided to enable the performance of individual gas circulators to be \"trimmed,\" were found to be extensively damaged, and the rotor blades and outlet guide vanes also had extensive impact and fatigue damage. Large numbers of the nuts and bolts involved had been shaken loose.<ref>\"Investigations into the failure of gas circulators and circuit components at Hinkley Point nuclear power station\" Rizk, W and Seymour, D F Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, v179 1964 p627-703</ref>\n\nThe subsequent investigation determined that the noise was caused by interaction between the IGVs and the rotor blades. The sound pressure levels generated by this noise were high enough to cause rapid fatigue failure in gas circuit components, and major re-design of the gas circulators and associated components was required. The IGVs were scrapped and flow straighteners introduced to smooth the flow of gas into the gas circulator intakes. Much pioneering experimental laboratory work on resonance and sound pressure levels was performed at English Electric's Gas Turbine and Atomic Power Division (APD) facilities at Whetstone, Leicestershire, to support the redesign work, and instrumentation to measure stress and sound pressure levels in the gas circuit during testing was developed. The delay caused severe financial difficulties for the consortium and set the construction schedule back; the station began generating electricity two years late in 1965.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2005/12/06/pwaod_hinkley_feature.shtml|title=Hinkley A: 1965|work=BBC Somerset|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>\n\n== Turbine Failure ==\n\nThe importance of materials design and the understanding of [[grain boundaries]] was highlighted during the operation of Hinkley Point. In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point \u2018A\u2019 turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the burst disc and the shaft caused the adjacent disc to burst almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This is thought to be the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the burst discs were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper embrittled during slow furnace cooling after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the absence of cracks. A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, it was not possible to quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material\u2019s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions.<ref>Kalderon, D.

With the closure of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in 1998, some small offices also moved to RAL.

The major mergers were in 1975 with the adjacent [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] creating the Rutherford Laboratory, and then in 1979 with the [[Appleton Laboratory]] to form the current Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. With the closure of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in 1998, some small offices also moved to RAL. Similarly, laser technology moved to RAL from [[Joint European Torus]] at [[Culham]] to become the foundation of the Central Laser Facility.\n\nTo be able to decide the priorities for government funding across all areas of scientific research, the Science & Technology Act of 1965<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1965/plain/cukpga_19650004_en | date = 23 March 1965 | title = Science & Technology Act, 1965 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=6 June 2009}}</ref> created the Science Research Council (SRC) which took over management of the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory from NIRNS along with many other previously disparate UK science bodies.

RAL management have argued that this is achieved in various ways, including:\n\n* From the commercial products and services resulting from the scientific results which are achieved on the facilities at RAL (e.g., through new materials, new drugs etc.).\n* Through the early warning of disasters predicted from terrestrial and space data acquired and analysed at RAL (e.g., radio/mobile phone interference predictions, severe weather predictions etc.).\n* Through the training of specialist scientists and engineers at RAL, who then move into commercial companies.\n* Through the standardisation of technologies which has resulted in the acceleration of economic growth through interoperability and interchangeability of products \u2014 especially in computing.\n* By the enthusiasm generated in science by the results of large facilities (e.g., from astronomical images or from particle physics experiments), which leads to schoolchildren choosing scientific training and scientific careers in many fields.\n* By technologies developed at RAL during the development of facilities themselves, which are then licensed to UK companies, or spin-out companies.\n\n==Decomissioning==\nAccording to its Annual Report from 2017-2018, STFC expects the end of the ISIS pulsed neutron source and the associated Second Target Station to be in 2040 and anticipates decommissioning to take 55 years.

His nickname is Bird, given to him by his Grandad. However, when his granddad passes away, Mekhai grows close to his grandad's best friend named Uncle Son. Together they go to the park, feed pigeons, tell stories, and drink coffee. Bird loves to draw to remember and better understand things in his life. His favorite thing to draw is, of course, birds. Flashing back, Bird describes his brother Marcus who is a graffiti artist that teaches him to draw. However, Marcus introduces difficulties to the plot by becoming distant and showing signs of drug abuse. Bird doesn't quite understand what is happening to his brother and wants to spend more time with him, but Marcus is adamant in telling Bird to continue to go to school. One day, Bird finds Marcus in bed showing withdrawal symptoms. He is confused and worried for his brother. Marcus lessens his appearance at the house and one day robs the house of its expensive belongings. His father explains to Bird that Marcus is suffering from a sickness and that he is no longer allowed home. Bird finds it difficult to obey his parents and often speaks to Marcus at the front door when their parents aren't home. Turning to Granddad for advice, Bird learns that \"'some broken things can't be fixed\". When Granddad dies, Uncle Son and Bird begin to go to the park every week.

Construction of the two 490 MW nuclear reactors, known as \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\", began in 1963. They became operational in 1971. Wylfa was located on the coast because seawater was used as a coolant.\n\nIn 2012, Reactor 2 was shut down. Three years later, Reactor 1 was switched off on 30 December 2015 so ending 44 years of operation at the site.\n\n'''Wylfa Newydd''' (literally New Wylfa) is a proposed new nuclear station on a site adjacent to the old plant. An application to build two [[advanced boiling water reactor]]s was submitted by [[Horizon Nuclear Power]] to the [[Office of Nuclear Regulation]] on 4 April 2017.\n\n==History==\nWylfa was the second nuclear power station to be built in [[Wales]] after [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station|Trawsfynydd]] in 1959. Following the closure of Trawsfynydd in 1991, Wylfa became Wales' only nuclear power station.\n\nConstruction of Wylfa, which was undertaken by British Nuclear Design & Construction (BNDC), a consortium backed by [[English Electric]], [[Babcock & Wilcox Ltd]] and [[Taylor Woodrow Construction]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/appendices/nuclear-development-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx|title=Nuclear Development in the United Kingdom -UK Nuclear Energy Development - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}</ref> began in 1963. The reactors were supplied by The Nuclear Power Group (TNPG) and the turbines by [[English Electric]]. These were the largest and last Magnox-type reactors to be built in the UK. Wylfa was also the second British nuclear power station, following [[Oldbury nuclear power station|Oldbury]], to have a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel instead of steel for easier construction and enhanced safety.\n\nWylfa's two 490&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] [[Magnox]] [[nuclear reactor]]s, \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\" became operational in 1971.<ref name=plants>[http://www.industcards.com/nuclear-uk-sc-wl.htm Nuclear Power Plants in the UK - Scotland and Wales] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719124719/http%3A//www.industcards.com/nuclear%2Duk%2Dsc%2Dwl.htm |date=19 July 2009 }}</ref> They typically supplied 23&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]]&nbsp;[[hour|h]] of electricity daily when they were both in service. \n\nAlthough the original design output was 1,190&nbsp;MW, unexpected accelerated (\"breakaway\") corrosion of [[mild steel]] components of the gas circuit in hot [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] was detected even before the first reactor began operating. The channel gas outlet temperature, the temperature at which the CO<sub>2</sub> leaves the fuel channels in the reactor core, had to be reduced, initially dropping the power output to 840&nbsp;MW, which was later raised to 980&nbsp;MW as more experience accumulated. A considerable portion of the output, up to 255 MW, was consumed by the nearby [[Anglesey Aluminium]] smelting plant.<ref name=bbc-20090115>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7829478.stm |title=Power deal threat to metal plant |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe graphite cores each weigh {{convert|3800|tonne|LT|-2|lk=on}}; 6,156 vertical fuel channels contain over 49,248 natural uranium [[magnox (alloy)|magnox]]-clad fuel elements, hence the name magnox reactor.  A further 200 channels allow [[boron]] control rods to enter the reactor and control the nuclear reaction. The primary coolant in the reactors is [[carbon dioxide]] gas.\n\nThe power station is still managed by Magnox Ltd, formerly Magnox North, formerly British Nuclear Group, formerly Magnox Electric, formerly Nuclear Electric, formerly National Power, formerly the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The site is owned by the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] (NDA). Its purpose is to oversee the decommissioning and clean-up of the UK's civil nuclear legacy.\n\nDuring its operational life substantial works were needed to strengthen the reactors against deteriorating welds discovered in the safety review in April 2000.  Amid public controversy, Greenpeace issued an independent safety appraisal<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/taxonomy/term/454 Review of ageing processes and their influence on safety and performance of Wylfa nuclear power station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203132717/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/taxonomy/term/454 |date=3 December 2008 }}, Greenpeace</ref> commissioned a report from Large Associates, critical of the plant and its restart plans, but the permit to restart operation was given in August 2001.

Wylfa was also the second British nuclear power station, following [[Oldbury nuclear power station|Oldbury]], to have a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel instead of steel for easier construction and enhanced safety.\n\nWylfa's two 490&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] [[Magnox]] [[nuclear reactor]]s, \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\" became operational in 1971.<ref name=plants>[http://www.industcards.com/nuclear-uk-sc-wl.htm Nuclear Power Plants in the UK - Scotland and Wales] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719124719/http%3A//www.industcards.com/nuclear%2Duk%2Dsc%2Dwl.htm |date=19 July 2009 }}</ref> They typically supplied 23&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]]&nbsp;[[hour|h]] of electricity daily when they were both in service. \n\nAlthough the original design output was 1,190&nbsp;MW, unexpected accelerated (\"breakaway\") corrosion of [[mild steel]] components of the gas circuit in hot [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] was detected even before the first reactor began operating. The channel gas outlet temperature, the temperature at which the CO<sub>2</sub> leaves the fuel channels in the reactor core, had to be reduced, initially dropping the power output to 840&nbsp;MW, which was later raised to 980&nbsp;MW as more experience accumulated. A considerable portion of the output, up to 255 MW, was consumed by the nearby [[Anglesey Aluminium]] smelting plant.<ref name=bbc-20090115>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7829478.stm |title=Power deal threat to metal plant |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe graphite cores each weigh {{convert|3800|tonne|LT|-2|lk=on}}; 6,156 vertical fuel channels contain over 49,248 natural uranium [[magnox (alloy)|magnox]]-clad fuel elements, hence the name magnox reactor.  A further 200 channels allow [[boron]] control rods to enter the reactor and control the nuclear reaction. The primary coolant in the reactors is [[carbon dioxide]] gas.\n\nThe power station is still managed by Magnox Ltd, formerly Magnox North, formerly British Nuclear Group, formerly Magnox Electric, formerly Nuclear Electric, formerly National Power, formerly the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The site is owned by the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] (NDA). Its purpose is to oversee the decommissioning and clean-up of the UK's civil nuclear legacy.\n\nDuring its operational life substantial works were needed to strengthen the reactors against deteriorating welds discovered in the safety review in April 2000.  Amid public controversy, Greenpeace issued an independent safety appraisal<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/taxonomy/term/454 Review of ageing processes and their influence on safety and performance of Wylfa nuclear power station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203132717/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/taxonomy/term/454 |date=3 December 2008 }}, Greenpeace</ref> commissioned a report from Large Associates, critical of the plant and its restart plans, but the permit to restart operation was given in August 2001.  In addition to welding weaknesses, radiolytic depletion of the graphite moderator blocks was still of concern and PAWB continue to campaign for early shut-down of the plant as well as against any nuclear replacement.\n\n===Closure and Decomissioning===\n\nOn 20 July 2006, the NDA announced that the station would be shut down in 2010 to enable the closure and decommissioning of the Magnox spent fuel reprocessing plant at [[Sellafield]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/5198146.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 July 2006 |title= Wylfa definitely closing in 2010 |accessdate= 2007-12-10}}</ref> [[Springfields|Springfields Fuels Limited]] ended production of Magnox fuel elements in 2008 due to these plans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Final shipment of new Magnox fuel|url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF-Final_shipment_of_new_Magnox_fuel-1912114.html|website = www.world-nuclear-news.org|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}</ref>  In 2010 the NDA announced an extension to 2012, beyond Wylfa's 40th anniversary as a generating power station in January 2011, due to schedule slippage at Sellafield which would allow Wylfa additional time before final defuelling.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2057790 |title=Wylfa to continue generating until 2012 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305192914/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2057790 |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Magnox life extension story - Nuclear Engineering International|url = http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurethe-magnox-life-extension-story/|website = www.neimagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}</ref>  At this time, a strategy was also devised to maximise the generation from the remaining fuel stock given that new fuel could no longer be manufactured.

It was renamed William H. Natcher Parkway in 1994 following the death of [[William H. Natcher]], a United States Congressman who represented the Second District of Kentucky for three decades. Natcher is best known for his record-setting string of 18,401&nbsp;[[roll call vote]]s, even being wheeled in on a hospital gurney to vote shortly before his death.\n\n===Glen Lily overpass=== \nIn 1973, the Glen Lily Road ([[Kentucky Route 2665|KY 2665]]) overpass over the parkway was awarded the title of \"Most Beautiful Bridge\" by the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] in the Highway Grade Separation category.<ref>[http://www.kentuckyroads.com/images/glenlily/ KentuckyRoads.com -- Glen Lily Overpass]{{sps|certain=y|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Additional interchange and name combinations===\nThe first added interchange built for the Natcher Parkway was the KY 70 interchange (exit 27, now exit 29) near Morgantown.

However, the newly designed marker signs that were installed on the Natcher Parkway in mid-2006 did not bear the words \"Green River\".\n\n===Toll removal===\nOn November 21, 2006, [[Toll road|toll plazas]] on the Natcher were removed. State law requires that toll collection cease when enough tolls are collected to pay off the parkway's construction bonds.

Natcher Green River Parkway''' was the designation for a [[freeway]] that runs from [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] to [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]] in the US state of Kentucky. The Natcher Parkway was one of nine highways that were a part of Kentucky's [[parkway]] system. The portion north of [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|Interstate 65]] (I-65) was signed as [[Interstate 165 (Kentucky)|I-165]], and the portion south of I-65 as [[Kentucky Route 9007]] (KY 9007) on March 6, 2019.\n\n==Route description==\nThe parkway began at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 231 in Kentucky|US Route&nbsp;231]] (US&nbsp;231) south of [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I-65]] (exit&nbsp;20) near Bowling Green. It traveled along the west side of the city in a northwesterly direction, through rolling farmlands and near coal mines, for {{convert|72.2|mi|km}} before meeting its northern terminus at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 60 in Kentucky|US&nbsp;60]] in Owensboro. At exit&nbsp;43, the parkway intersected with the [[Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway]].

It was renamed William H. Natcher Parkway in 1994 following the death of [[William H. Natcher]], a United States Congressman who represented the Second District of Kentucky for three decades. Natcher is best known for his record-setting string of 18,401&nbsp;[[roll call vote]]s, even being wheeled in on a hospital gurney to vote shortly before his death.\n\n===Glen Lily overpass=== \nIn 1973, the Glen Lily Road ([[Kentucky Route 2665|KY 2665]]) overpass over the parkway was awarded the title of \"Most Beautiful Bridge\" by the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] in the Highway Grade Separation category.<ref>[http://www.kentuckyroads.com/images/glenlily/ KentuckyRoads.com -- Glen Lily Overpass]{{sps|certain=y|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Additional interchange and name combinations===\nThe first added interchange built for the Natcher Parkway was the KY 70 interchange (exit 27, now exit 29) near Morgantown.

However, the newly designed marker signs that were installed on the Natcher Parkway in mid-2006 did not bear the words \"Green River\".\n\n===Toll removal===\nOn November 21, 2006, [[Toll road|toll plazas]] on the Natcher were removed. State law requires that toll collection cease when enough tolls are collected to pay off the parkway's construction bonds. The Natcher and the nearby Audubon Parkway, were the last two roads in the Kentucky parkway system to have their tolls removed.\n\nPrior to the removal of the tolls, toll plazas were located at exit 7 (later exit 9) in Bowling Green, exit 34 (later exit 36) in Cromwell\u2013Morgantown, and exit 48 (later exit 50) in Hartford.

Such requirements are usually stated only informally; and they are often controversial (i.e. management wants a secure system but staff desires user-friendliness).

Located {{convert|126.26|km|sp=us}} from [[Oslo Central Station]], it is served by long-distance and regional trains on the Dovre Line, as the terminus for regional trains on the R\u00f8ros Line, all operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB). A [[side platform]] and an [[island platform]] are in regular use. The station handled 1,062,300 passengers in 2008.\n\nThe station opened on 23 June 1862 as the western terminus of the [[narrow-gauge]] Hamar\u2013Grundset Line, today the R\u00f8ros Line. The first station building, in [[Swiss chalet style]], was designed by [[Georg Andreas Bull]]. Increased traffic caused the construction of a second station building, designed by [[Balthazar Conrad Lange]]. It opened in 1880 with the first part of the Dovre Line, which connected Hamar to [[Oslo]]. The current station building is designed by [[Paul Due]] in [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. It received major renovations in the 1970s and ahead of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. The Dovre Line past Hamar will be upgraded to [[double track]], and in conjunction with this moving the station is being considered.\n\n==History==\nHamar was incorporated as a town in 1849 and by 1861 had a population of 1,700.<ref name=nsb8>Norwegian State Railways: 8</ref> Proposals for a railway from Hamar to [[Elverum]] were first launched in 1854. The goal was to provide train services across the valley ridge to [[\u00d8sterdalen]], where Elverum acted as an important node. From Hamar, the a steam ship service was proposed across the lake of [[Mj\u00f8sa]] to [[Eidsvoll]], where passengers and cargo could be hauled by train to the capital and coast. The plan was approved by [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] on 3 September 1857.<ref>Bjerke & Stenersen: 16</ref> The necessity of [[transshipment]] to steam boat meant that the station had to be located on lakefront property. The place Gammelhusstranda was chosen, but gave the unusual result that the station was situated outside the city limits until a border change in 1878.<ref name=nsb9>Norwegian State Railways: 9</ref>\n\nHamar received the railway's administration and became its operational center. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull and construction of the wooden buildings were subcontracted to Chr. Eriksen.<ref>Bjerke & Stenersen: 18</ref> The line opened on 23 June 1862.<ref>Bjerke & Stenersen: 395</ref> The station had limited facilities with shunting being done by horse.<ref name=bs202>Bjerke & Stenersen: 202</ref> In its original configuration the station had three tracks, a main station building, a locomotive depot and a cargo building. Two tracks received a roof. All buildings were wooden, with the two-story main building a [[log house]] with paneling in Swiss chalet style. The upper story was used as housing.<ref name=nsb10>Norwegian State Railways: 10</ref> About forty people worked at the station from the opening.<ref name=nsb11>Norwegian State Railways: 11</ref>\n\n[[File:532 Hamar - no-nb digifoto 20150629 00202 bldsa PK25475.jpg|thumb|View of Hamar from the south during the early 1930s.]]\nThe water station was moved to the depot in 1863. Later a house adjacent to the station building was converted into a railway hotel. The docks received steam crane in 1864, followed by an extension three years later and a new crane in 1875.<ref name=bs202 /> The traffic at Hamar increased little until 1880. Later known as the R\u00f8ros Line, the railway was extended further up \u00d8sterdalen, eventually being connected with Trondheim in 1877.<ref name=nsb11 /> The main challenge was the inevitable break-of-gauge which would have to take place, as the Trunk Line had been built with standard gauge. The remaining link, the Eidsvoll\u2013Hamar Line, later reclassified as the first part of the Dovre Line, was initially planned as narrow gauge. This was changed by Parliament in 1875, making Hamar the site of the break-of-gauge.<ref name=nsb13>Norwegian State Railways: 13</ref>\n\nThe area and traffic generated by transshipment was so extensive that a new station building was needed. Balthazar Conrad Lange had become NSB's head architect, and was issued the task of designing a new main station building.<ref name=nsb13 /> The second station building was located east of the old, at roughly the location of the current bus station. Also built in wood, it received a roof which hung over the platform. The old station building was converted to railway offices.<ref name=nsb14>Norwegian State Railways: 14</ref> The track out of the station was moved further away from the lakeshore. The new station was taken into use in 1880.<ref name=bs202 />\n\n[[File:Hamar jernbaneverksted.jpg|thumb|A now disused depot building]]\nWith a connection to the capital, plans surfaced for the standard gauge line to be extended northwards through [[Gudbrandsdalen]]. With the extension to [[Sel]] approved in 1890, three proposals surfaced for the route through Hamar. All three cut the town off from the lakeshore. One involved the line being carried across a [[swing bridge]] which would allow access to the port, while two proposed a line across H\u00f8iensalodden, either the chosen route or one along Skappelsgate.<ref name=nsb14 /> The second station building had been built further away from the market square and there was a desire to build a new station closer to the town center. The site of the first station was therefore chosen as a suitable site for a new terminal building.<ref name=nsb15>Norwegian State Railways: 15</ref> The initial station was moved across the street, where it remained until it was demolished in 1925.<ref name=bs204>Bjerke & Stenersen: 204</ref>\n\nDesign of the third station building was commissioned to Paul Due, who was working as NSB's head architect at the time.<ref name=nsb15 /> The contract for construction was awarded to Byggmester Schilling from Kristiania.<ref name=artemisia>{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/hamar/hamar.stasjon.html |last=Steigan |first=Geir Tandberg |year=2003 |title=Hamar jernbanestasjon |publisher=Artemisia |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 January 2016 |archivedate=13 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113151138/http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/hamar/hamar.stasjon.html}}</ref> It was completed after completion of the Sel Line, being taken into use on 8 November 1897. At the same time a separate restaurant building opened. The center section of the second station was moved to the deport area, where it served as an office. An expanded depot opened in 1898. The station received electric lighting about 1900 and a new, two-track engine shed opened in 1905. Five years later a second such shed was completed, and a circular shed was finished in 1914.<ref name=bs204 />\n\n[[File:26c412-ses20584.jpg|thumb|left|[[NSB Class 26|Class 26c]] steam locomotive on the turntable at Hamar in 1970]]\nWith the establishment of the [[Norwegian State Railways (1883\u20131996)|Norwegian State Railways]] in 1883, Hamar Station became the administrative site for Hamar District. This would by 1924 reach an area consisting of the Dovre Line from [[Eidsvoll Station]] to [[Domb\u00e5s Station]], the [[Rauma Line]], and the R\u00f8ros Line north to [[Tynset Station]].<ref>Gjerd\u00e5ker: 12</ref> From 1880 to 1931 Hamar Station received a high amount of activity from its role as transshipment point between the narrow-gauge R\u00f8ros Line and the standard gauge Eidsvoll\u2013Sel Line. With increasing traffic the station area grew gradually, with an increasing number of tracks, built without any long-term plan.<ref name=bs204 /> By 1916 there were 96 [[railroad switch|switches]], resulting in low speeds, inefficient and unreliable operation. Despite the number of tracks, shunting often had to be done on the main line. The track arrangements were not cleaned up until the [[gauge conversion]] on the R\u00f8ros Line was completed in 1931. The following year a new [[interlocking]] system was installed.<ref name=bs205>Bjerke & Stenersen: 205</ref>\n\n[[File:196 Hamar - no-nb digifoto 20150629 00242 bldsa PK25616.jpg|thumb|The restaurant building in the foreground and the station building behind it, some time between 1905 and 1912]]\nAfter having been operated by Harald Larsen, the restaurant was taken over by [[Norsk Spisevognselskap]] on 1 January 1921, who paid NOK&nbsp;87,786 for the inventory. The following year they redecorated it based on drawings by [[Gudmund Hoel]], with the dining room decorated by theater painter Jens Wang. He made several large [[fresco]] paintings, including the ruins of [[Hamar Cathedral]], motives from Mj\u00f8sa, \u00c5kersvika and an old settlement in Hedmark style. On the northern wall there were two large paintings, one of H\u00f8sbj\u00f8r Tourist Hotel and one of a view of Mj\u00f8sa. The renovation of the restaurant cost NOK&nbsp;43,000 and was taken into use on 15 December 1922.<ref>Just: 63</ref> A station park was installed in front of the station in 1924.<ref name=h10>Hals: 10</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian Railway Museum has its origins from 1896.<ref>Norwegian Railway Museum: 3</ref> It gathered historical items from various railways and had from the opening of the third station until 1912 a display in the upper floor of the terminus building. At that time the station ran out of place and the museum had to relocate. It lacked a venue for more than a decade while its board searched for a proper site. This issue was settled in 1925, when the museum secured a lot to the north of Hamar Station. It could open as an open-air museum in 1930. NSB took formal ownership of the museum in 1946 and the lot on was it. A new and larger museum could was opened in 1956.<ref>Norwegian Railway Museum: 4</ref>\n\n[[File:NSB type 93.jpg|thumb|left|[[NSB Class 93|Class 93]] diesel train at Hamar, used on the [[R\u00f8ros Line]]]]\nThe Dovre Line south of Hamar to Eidsvoll was electrified on 15 June 1953.

The roof ornaments were not demolished but simply covered.<ref name=\"nsb15\"/> [[Automatic train stop]] was installed on 1 November 1983.<ref name=bh75 /> The station park was renovated in 1990.<ref name=artemisia />\n\nHamar Station received an upgrade ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics, for which Hamar was a host city. The original station building was little suited for modern use and the outdoor areas served transfer to bus, car and taxis poorly.<ref>Norwegian State Railways: 2</ref> NSB therefore decided to demolish the cargo and electric buildings to make room for a new bus terminal.<ref name=nsb3>Norwegian State Railways: 3</ref> The remaining part of the station, including the restaurant building, were renovated to as close to the original plans and interior as feasible, largely undoing the work of the 1970s.<ref name=nsb4>Norwegian State Railways: 4</ref> The work involved building an underpass and an overpass to tracks 2 and 3.<ref name=nsb7>Norwegian State Railways: 7</ref> The project was funded as a joint project between NSB, [[Hamar Municipality]], [[Hedmark County Municipality]] and the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]].<ref name=nsb3 /> Manned ticket sales by NSB were terminated on 19 January 2002 and taken over by [[Narvesen]].<ref name=bs205 />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Hamar train station.jpg|thumb|The station building as seen from the track side]]\nThe third and current main station building is designed by Paul Due in [[historicism (art)|historicism]].

It features a prominent central section with plastered gables facing both towards the town and the platforms. The main entrances there are formed as [[triumphal arch]]es in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. The historicist design is reflected through a [[neo-baroque]] central part, [[New Renaissance]] wings, all with [[New Gothic]] and Romanesque windows and decors.<ref name=h9>Hals: 9</ref> The otherwise symmetrical form is broken by a round staircase on the northern end. The lower floor was initially designed as public areas and <ref name=artemisia />\n\nThe terminal building is widely regarded as Paul Due's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.<ref name=nsb15 /><ref name=artemisia /> It is situated at the lower end of Hamar's main street, Strandgata, with the other end of the street featuring Hamar's basar.<ref name=h9 /> South of the station building is Due's restaurant building. It has a similar style to the station building, but lacks symmetry. It originally had a Medieval inspired interior, but this was changed to [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] in 1922.<ref>Norwegian State Railways: 18</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThe station is situated on the Dovre Line, {{convert|126.26|km|sp=us}} from [[Oslo Central Station]] and {{convert|426.6|km|sp=us}} from [[Trondheim Central Station]], at an elevation of {{convert|127|m|sp=us}}. Hamar Station is also the southern terminus of the R\u00f8ros Line.<ref>Bjerke & Holom: 79</ref> The station has 3 tracks.   Track 1 is served by a {{convert|414|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[side platform]] which is {{convert|62|cm|sp=us}} tall, normally used by southbound trains. Track 2 and 3 share a {{convert|365|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long and {{convert|52|cm|sp=us}} tall [[island platform]]. Track 2 normally serves trains on the R\u00f8ros Line, while track 3 serves northbound trains on the Dovre Line. Tracks 2 and 3 are accessible from an underpass from the station building and an overpass to the south of the station.\nThe station building features a heated waiting room, a caf\u00e9 and kiosk, as well as luggage lockers, washrooms and ticket vending machines.

stasjon}}) is a [[railway station]] of the [[Dovre Line]] and the [[R\u00f8ros Line]] located in downtown [[Hamar]], [[Norway]]. Located {{convert|126.26|km|sp=us}} from [[Oslo Central Station]], it is served by long-distance and regional trains on the Dovre Line, as the terminus for regional trains on the R\u00f8ros Line, all operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB). A [[side platform]] and an [[island platform]] are in regular use. The station handled 1,062,300 passengers in 2008.\n\nThe station opened on 23 June 1862 as the western terminus of the [[narrow-gauge]] Hamar\u2013Grundset Line, today the R\u00f8ros Line. The first station building, in [[Swiss chalet style]], was designed by [[Georg Andreas Bull]]. Increased traffic caused the construction of a second station building, designed by [[Balthazar Conrad Lange]]. It opened in 1880 with the first part of the Dovre Line, which connected Hamar to [[Oslo]]. The current station building is designed by [[Paul Due]] in [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. It received major renovations in the 1970s and ahead of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. The Dovre Line past Hamar will be upgraded to [[double track]], and in conjunction with this moving the station is being considered.\n\n==History==\nHamar was incorporated as a town in 1849 and by 1861 had a population of 1,700.<ref name=nsb8>Norwegian State Railways: 8</ref> Proposals for a railway from Hamar to [[Elverum]] were first launched in 1854. The goal was to provide train services across the valley ridge to [[\u00d8sterdalen]], where Elverum acted as an important node. From Hamar, the a steam ship service was proposed across the lake of [[Mj\u00f8sa]] to [[Eidsvoll]], where passengers and cargo could be hauled by train to the capital and coast. The plan was approved by [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] on 3 September 1857.<ref>Bjerke & Stenersen: 16</ref> The necessity of [[transshipment]] to steam boat meant that the station had to be located on lakefront property. The place Gammelhusstranda was chosen, but gave the unusual result that the station was situated outside the city limits until a border change in 1878.<ref name=nsb9>Norwegian State Railways: 9</ref>\n\nHamar received the railway's administration and became its operational center. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull and construction of the wooden buildings were subcontracted to Chr. Eriksen.<ref>Bjerke & Stenersen: 18</ref> The line opened on 23 June 1862.<ref>Bjerke & Stenersen: 395</ref> The station had limited facilities with shunting being done by horse.<ref name=bs202>Bjerke & Stenersen: 202</ref> In its original configuration the station had three tracks, a main station building, a locomotive depot and a cargo building. Two tracks received a roof. All buildings were wooden, with the two-story main building a [[log house]] with paneling in Swiss chalet style. The upper story was used as housing.<ref name=nsb10>Norwegian State Railways: 10</ref> About forty people worked at the station from the opening.<ref name=nsb11>Norwegian State Railways: 11</ref>\n\n[[File:532 Hamar - no-nb digifoto 20150629 00202 bldsa PK25475.jpg|thumb|View of Hamar from the south during the early 1930s.]]\nThe water station was moved to the depot in 1863. Later a house adjacent to the station building was converted into a railway hotel. The docks received steam crane in 1864, followed by an extension three years later and a new crane in 1875.<ref name=bs202 /> The traffic at Hamar increased little until 1880. Later known as the R\u00f8ros Line, the railway was extended further up \u00d8sterdalen, eventually being connected with Trondheim in 1877.<ref name=nsb11 /> The main challenge was the inevitable break-of-gauge which would have to take place, as the Trunk Line had been built with standard gauge. The remaining link, the Eidsvoll\u2013Hamar Line, later reclassified as the first part of the Dovre Line, was initially planned as narrow gauge. This was changed by Parliament in 1875, making Hamar the site of the break-of-gauge.<ref name=nsb13>Norwegian State Railways: 13</ref>\n\nThe area and traffic generated by transshipment was so extensive that a new station building was needed. Balthazar Conrad Lange had become NSB's head architect, and was issued the task of designing a new main station building.<ref name=nsb13 /> The second station building was located east of the old, at roughly the location of the current bus station. Also built in wood, it received a roof which hung over the platform. The old station building was converted to railway offices.<ref name=nsb14>Norwegian State Railways: 14</ref> The track out of the station was moved further away from the lakeshore. The new station was taken into use in 1880.<ref name=bs202 />\n\n[[File:Hamar jernbaneverksted.jpg|thumb|A now disused depot building]]\nWith a connection to the capital, plans surfaced for the standard gauge line to be extended northwards through [[Gudbrandsdalen]]. With the extension to [[Sel]] approved in 1890, three proposals surfaced for the route through Hamar. All three cut the town off from the lakeshore. One involved the line being carried across a [[swing bridge]] which would allow access to the port, while two proposed a line across H\u00f8iensalodden, either the chosen route or one along Skappelsgate.<ref name=nsb14 /> The second station building had been built further away from the market square and there was a desire to build a new station closer to the town center. The site of the first station was therefore chosen as a suitable site for a new terminal building.<ref name=nsb15>Norwegian State Railways: 15</ref> The initial station was moved across the street, where it remained until it was demolished in 1925.<ref name=bs204>Bjerke & Stenersen: 204</ref>\n\nDesign of the third station building was commissioned to Paul Due, who was working as NSB's head architect at the time.<ref name=nsb15 /> The contract for construction was awarded to Byggmester Schilling from Kristiania.<ref name=artemisia>{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/hamar/hamar.stasjon.html |last=Steigan |first=Geir Tandberg |year=2003 |title=Hamar jernbanestasjon |publisher=Artemisia |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 January 2016 |archivedate=13 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113151138/http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/hamar/hamar.stasjon.html}}</ref> It was completed after completion of the Sel Line, being taken into use on 8 November 1897. At the same time a separate restaurant building opened. The center section of the second station was moved to the deport area, where it served as an office. An expanded depot opened in 1898. The station received electric lighting about 1900 and a new, two-track engine shed opened in 1905. Five years later a second such shed was completed, and a circular shed was finished in 1914.<ref name=bs204 />\n\n[[File:26c412-ses20584.jpg|thumb|left|[[NSB Class 26|Class 26c]] steam locomotive on the turntable at Hamar in 1970]]\nWith the establishment of the [[Norwegian State Railways (1883\u20131996)|Norwegian State Railways]] in 1883, Hamar Station became the administrative site for Hamar District. This would by 1924 reach an area consisting of the Dovre Line from [[Eidsvoll Station]] to [[Domb\u00e5s Station]], the [[Rauma Line]], and the R\u00f8ros Line north to [[Tynset Station]].<ref>Gjerd\u00e5ker: 12</ref> From 1880 to 1931 Hamar Station received a high amount of activity from its role as transshipment point between the narrow-gauge R\u00f8ros Line and the standard gauge Eidsvoll\u2013Sel Line. With increasing traffic the station area grew gradually, with an increasing number of tracks, built without any long-term plan.<ref name=bs204 /> By 1916 there were 96 [[railroad switch|switches]], resulting in low speeds, inefficient and unreliable operation. Despite the number of tracks, shunting often had to be done on the main line. The track arrangements were not cleaned up until the [[gauge conversion]] on the R\u00f8ros Line was completed in 1931. The following year a new [[interlocking]] system was installed.<ref name=bs205>Bjerke & Stenersen: 205</ref>\n\n[[File:196 Hamar - no-nb digifoto 20150629 00242 bldsa PK25616.jpg|thumb|The restaurant building in the foreground and the station building behind it, some time between 1905 and 1912]]\nAfter having been operated by Harald Larsen, the restaurant was taken over by [[Norsk Spisevognselskap]] on 1 January 1921, who paid NOK&nbsp;87,786 for the inventory. The following year they redecorated it based on drawings by [[Gudmund Hoel]], with the dining room decorated by theater painter Jens Wang. He made several large [[fresco]] paintings, including the ruins of [[Hamar Cathedral]], motives from Mj\u00f8sa, \u00c5kersvika and an old settlement in Hedmark style. On the northern wall there were two large paintings, one of H\u00f8sbj\u00f8r Tourist Hotel and one of a view of Mj\u00f8sa. The renovation of the restaurant cost NOK&nbsp;43,000 and was taken into use on 15 December 1922.<ref>Just: 63</ref> A station park was installed in front of the station in 1924.<ref name=h10>Hals: 10</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian Railway Museum has its origins from 1896.<ref>Norwegian Railway Museum: 3</ref> It gathered historical items from various railways and had from the opening of the third station until 1912 a display in the upper floor of the terminus building. At that time the station ran out of place and the museum had to relocate. It lacked a venue for more than a decade while its board searched for a proper site. This issue was settled in 1925, when the museum secured a lot to the north of Hamar Station. It could open as an open-air museum in 1930. NSB took formal ownership of the museum in 1946 and the lot on was it. A new and larger museum could was opened in 1956.<ref>Norwegian Railway Museum: 4</ref>\n\n[[File:NSB type 93.jpg|thumb|left|[[NSB Class 93|Class 93]] diesel train at Hamar, used on the [[R\u00f8ros Line]]]]\nThe Dovre Line south of Hamar to Eidsvoll was electrified on 15 June 1953.

The roof ornaments were not demolished but simply covered.<ref name=\"nsb15\"/> [[Automatic train stop]] was installed on 1 November 1983.<ref name=bh75 /> The station park was renovated in 1990.<ref name=artemisia />\n\nHamar Station received an upgrade ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics, for which Hamar was a host city. The original station building was little suited for modern use and the outdoor areas served transfer to bus, car and taxis poorly.<ref>Norwegian State Railways: 2</ref> NSB therefor decided to demolish the cargo and electric buildings to make room for a new bus terminal.<ref name=nsb3>Norwegian State Railways: 3</ref> The remaining part of the station, including the restaurant building, were renovated to as close to the original plans and interior as feasible, largely undoing the work of the 1970s.<ref name=nsb4>Norwegian State Railways: 4</ref> The work involved building an underpass and an overpass to tracks 2 and 3.<ref name=nsb7>Norwegian State Railways: 7</ref> The project was funded as a joint project between NSB, [[Hamar Municipality]], [[Hedmark County Municipality]] and the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]].<ref name=nsb3 /> Manned ticket sales by NSB were terminated on 19 January 2002 and taken over by [[Narvesen]].<ref name=bs205 />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Hamar train station.jpg|thumb|The station building as seen from the track side]]\nThe third and current main station building is designed by Paul Due in [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. It is built with plastered brick, with dominant sections in red brick and details in yellow plaster. It features a prominent central section with plastered gables facing both towards the town and the platforms. The main entrances there are formed as [[triumphal arch]]es in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. The historicist design is reflected through a [[neo-baroque]] central part, [[New Renaissance]] wings, all with [[New Gothic]] and Romanesque windows and decors.<ref name=h9>Hals: 9</ref> The otherwise symmetrical form is broken by a round staircase on the northern end. The lower floor was initially designed as public areas and <ref name=artemisia />\n\nThe terminal building is widely regarded as Paul Due's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.<ref name=nsb15 /><ref name=artemisia /> It is situated at the lower end of Hamar's main street, Strandgata, with the other end of the street featuring Hamar's basar.<ref name=h9 /> South of the station building is Due's restaurant building. It has a similar style to the station building, but lacks symmetry. It originally had a Medieval inspired interior, but this was changed to [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] in 1922.<ref>Norwegian State Railways: 18</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThe station is situated on the Dovre Line, {{convert|126.26|km|sp=us}} from [[Oslo Central Station]] and {{convert|426.6|km|sp=us}} from [[Trondheim Central Station]], at an elevation of {{convert|127|m|sp=us}}. Hamar Station is also the southern terminus of the R\u00f8ros Line.<ref>Bjerke & Holom: 79</ref> The station has 3 tracks.   Track 1 is served by a {{convert|414|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[side platform]] which is {{convert|62|cm|sp=us}} tall, normally used by southbound trains. Track 2 and 3 share a {{convert|365|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long and {{convert|52|cm|sp=us}} tall [[island platform]]. Track 2 normally serves trains on the R\u00f8ros Line, while track 3 serves northbound trains on the Dovre Line. Tracks 2 and 3 are accessible from an underpass from the station building and an overpass to the south of the station.\nThe station building features a heated waiting room, a caf\u00e9 and kiosk, as well as luggage lockers, washrooms and ticket vending machines.
