The palace was located at the north of the current city of [[Aachen]], today in the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|Land]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Most of the Carolingian palace was built in the 790s but the works went on until Charlemagne's death in 814. The plans, drawn by [[Odo of Metz]], were part with the programme of renovation of the kingdom decided by the ruler. Today much of the palace is destroyed, but the Palatine Chapel has been preserved and is considered as a masterpiece of [[Carolingian architecture]] and a characteristic example of architecture from the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\n[[File:AixGeneral.GIF|thumb|Simplified plan: 1 = council hall ; 2 = porch ; 3 = treasury and archives ; 4 = gallery ; 5 = tribunal and garrison ; 6 = metatorium ; 7 = curia ; 8 = secretarium ; 9 = chapel ; 10 = atrium ; 11 = thermae]]\n\n== Historical context ==\n\n=== The palace before Charlemagne ===\n[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|The construction of Aachen, [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]] by [[Jean Fouquet]], in the ''Grandes Chroniques de France'', 15th century. [[Charlemagne]] is at the foreground.]]\n\nIn [[ancient times]], the Romans chose the site of Aachen for its thermal springs and its forward position towards [[Germania]]. The site, called ''Aquae Granni'', was equipped with {{convert|50|acre}}<ref name=\"Erlande104\">A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 104</ref> of ''[[thermae]]'' that remained in use from the 1st to the 4th century.<ref name=\"Favier285\">J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 285</ref> The Roman city grew in connection with the ''thermae'' according to a classical [[grid plan]] similar to that of [[castra|Roman legions' camps]]. A palace was used to accommodate the [[Roman governor|governor]] of the [[Roman province|province]] or the Emperor. In the 4th century, the city and the palace were destroyed during the [[Migration Period|Barbarian invasions]]. [[Clovis I|Clovis]] made [[Paris]] the capital of the [[Frankish Kingdom]], and Aachen Palace was abandoned until the advent of the Carolingian dynasty. The [[Pippinid]] [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]] carried out some restoration works, but it was at the time only one residence among others. The Frankish court was itinerant and the rulers moved according to the circumstances. Around 765, [[Pepin the Short]] had a palace erected over the remains of the old Roman building; he had the thermae restored and removed its [[pagan]] [[cult image|idols]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\">P. Rich\u00e9, ''La vie quotidienne dans l\u2019Empire carolingien'', p. 57</ref> As soon as he came to power in 768, Charlemagne spent time in Aachen as well as in other [[villa]]s in [[Austrasia]].<ref name=\"Favier285\"/> In the 790s, he decided to settle down in order to govern his kingdom, then his empire more efficiently.\n\n=== The choice of Aachen ===\n[[File:AachenKarlDerGrosse.jpg|thumb|Statue of Charlemagne in front of Aachen's city hall]]\n\nThe site of Aachen was chosen by Charlemagne after careful consideration in a key moment of his reign.<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 92</ref> Since his advent as King of the Franks, Charlemagne had led numerous military expeditions that had both filled his treasury and enlarged his realm, most notably towards the East. He conquered [[pagan]] [[Old Saxony|Saxony]] in 772\u2013780, but this area resisted and the war with the [[Saxons]] lasted for about thirty years. Charlemagne ended the Germanic custom of an itinerant court moving from place to place and established a real capital. As he was ageing, he decreased the frequency of military expeditions and, after 806, virtually did not leave Aachen.<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 582</ref>\n\nAachen's geographic location was a decisive factor in Charlemagne's choice: the place was situated in the Carolingian heartlands of [[Austrasia]], the cradle of his family, East of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] river, at a crossroads of land roads and on a [[tributary]] of the [[Rur]], called the [[Wurm]]. From then, Charlemagne left the administration of the Southern regions to his son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], named [[King of Aquitaine]],<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 287</ref> which enabled him to reside in the North.\n\n[[File:Empire carolingien 768-811-2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Carolingian Empire]] and its capital, Aachen, in the early 9th century.]]\n\nBesides, settling down in Aachen enabled Charlemagne to control from closer the operations in Saxony.<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, pp. 92\u201393</ref> Charlemagne also considered other advantages of the place: surrounded with forest abounding in game, he intended to abandon himself to [[hunting]] in the area.<ref name=\"Art76\">G. D\u00e9mians d\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', 1992, p. 76</ref> The ageing emperor could also benefit from Aachen's hot springs.\n\nThe scholars of the Carolingian era presented Charlemagne as the \"New [[Constantine I|Constantine]]\"; in this context, he needed a capital and a palace worthy of the name.<ref name=\"Rich\u00e9326\">P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens. Une famille qui fit l\u2019Europe'', 1983, p. 326</ref><ref>M. Durliat, ''Des barbares \u00e0 l\u2019an Mil'', 1985, p. 145</ref> He left [[Rome]] to the [[Pope]]. The rivalry with the [[Byzantine Empire]]<ref name=\"Art76\"/> led Charlemagne to build a magnificent palace. The fire that destroyed his palace in [[Worms (city)|Worms]] in 793<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 288</ref> also encouraged him to follow such a plan.\n\n{{-}}\n\n=== Importance of the project entrusted to Odo of Metz ===\n[[File:Eginhard \u00e9crivant.jpg|thumb|Eginhard is Charlemagne's biographer; the name of the architect of the Palace of Aachen is known thanks to his work (14th/15th-century illumination)]]\nHistorians know almost nothing about the architect of the Palace of Aachen, [[Odo of Metz]]. His name appears in the works of [[Eginhard]] (c. 775\u2013840), Charlemagne's [[biographer]]. He is supposed to have been an educated cleric, familiar with [[liberal arts]], especially ''[[quadrivia]]''. He had probably read [[Vitruvius]]' treatise on architecture, ''[[De Architectura]]''.<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 502</ref>\n\nThe decision to build the palace was taken in the late 780s or the early 790s, before Charlemagne held the title of emperor. Works began in 794<ref>Christian Bonnet (dir.), ''Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s en Europe (milieu du VI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle \u2013 fin du IX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle)'', Paris, Ellipses, 2002, {{ISBN|978-2729812317}}, p. 184</ref> and went on for several years. Aachen quickly became the favourite residence of the sovereign. After 807, he almost did not leave it any more. In the absence of sufficient documentation, it is impossible to know the number of workers employed, but the dimensions of the building make it probable that there were many of them.\n\nThe geometry of the plan chosen was very simple: Odo of Metz decided to keep the layout of the Roman roads and inscribe the square in 360 Carolingian [[foot (unit)|feet]], or 120 metres-side square.<ref>A Carolingian foot corresponds to 0,333 metres</ref><ref name=\"Erlande103\">A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 103</ref> The square enclosed an area of 50 acres<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens \u2026'', 1983, p. 325</ref> divided in four parts by a North-South axis (the stone gallery) and an East-West axis (the former [[Roman road]], the [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]). To the north of this square lay the council hall, to the south the Palatine Chapel. The architect drew a triangle toward the East to connect the thermae to the palace complex. The two best-known buildings are the council hall (today disappeared) and the Palatine Chapel, included into the [[Aachen Cathedral|Cathedral]]. The other buildings are hardly identified.<ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\">R\u00e9gine Le Jan, ''La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Haut Moyen \u00c2ge, VI<sup>e</sup> \u2013 IX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle'', Paris, Armand Colin, 2003, {{ISBN|2-200-26577-8}}, p. 120</ref> Often built in [[timber framing]], made of [[wood]] and [[brick]], they have been destroyed. Lastly, the palace complex was surrounded with a wall.<ref name=\"Viequot58\">P. Rich\u00e9, ''La vie quotidienne dans l\u2019Empire carolingien'', p. 58</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the court in Aachen and the construction work stimulated the activity in the city that experienced growth in the late 8th century and the early 9th century, as craftsmen, traders and shopkeepers had settled near the court. Some important ones lived in houses inside the city. The members of the Palace Academy and Charlemagne's advisors such as [[Eginhard]] and [[Angilbert]] owned houses near the palace.<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/>\n\n== Council Hall ==\n[[File:Aix salle des assembl\u00e9es.svg|thumb|Location of the hall within the Palace (red)]]\n\nLocated at the North of the Palace complex, the great Council Hall (''[[aula regia]]'' or ''aula palatina'' in Latin) was used to house the speeches delivered by the Emperor once a year. This occasion gathered the highest officials in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] Empire, dignitaries and the hierarchy of the power: [[counts]], [[vassals]] of the king, [[bishops]] and [[abbots]]. The general assembly was usually held in May. Participants discussed important political and legal affairs. [[Capitularies]], written by [[amanuenses]] of the Aachen [[chancellor|chancellery]], summed up the decisions taken. In this building also took place official ceremonies and the reception of [[embassies]]. Describing the coronation of Louis, son of Charlemagne, [[Ermold the Black]] states that there Charlemagne \"spoke down from his golden seat.\"<ref>Ermold le Noir, ''Po\u00e8me sur Louis le Pieux et \u00e9p\u00eetres au roi P\u00e9pin'', \u00e9dit\u00e9 et traduit par Edmond Faral, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1964, p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:Trier Konstantinbasilika BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Aula Palatina|Constantine Basilica]] in Trier, Germany was probably used as a model for Aachen's Council Hall]]\n\nThe dimensions of the hall (1,000 m<sup>2</sup>) were suitable to the reception of several hundreds of people at the same time:<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens. Une famille qui fit l\u2019Europe'', 1983, p. 131</ref> although the building has been destroyed, it is known it was 47,42 metres long, 20,76 metres large and 21 metres high.<ref name=\"Erlande103\"/> The plan seems to be based upon the Roman ''[[Aula Palatina|aula palatina]]'' of [[Trier]]. The structure was made of brick, and the shape was that of a civil [[basilica]] with three [[apse]]s: the largest one (17,2 m),<ref name=\"Erlande103\"/> located to the West, was dedicated to the king and his suite. The two other apses, to the North and South, were smaller. Light entered through two rows of windows. The inside was probably decorated with paintings depicting heroes both from the Ancient times and contemporary.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/> A wooden gallery girdled the building between the two rows of windows. From this gallery could be seen the [[Market (place)|market]] that was held North of the Palace. A gallery with [[porticos]] on the southern side of the hall gave access to the building. The southern apse cut through the middle of this entrance.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/>{{clr}}\n\n== Palatine Chapel ==\n{{Main article|Palatine Chapel in Aachen}}\n\n=== Description ===\n[[File:Aachen Dehio 1887.jpg|thumb|upright|Section of the Palatine Chapel]]\n[[File:Aachener Dom Portal Bronzetore 2014.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Bronze portal (''Wolfst\u00fcr'')]]\n\nThe Palatine Chapel was located at the other side of the palace complex, at the South. A stone gallery linked it to the ''aula regia''. It symbolized another aspect of Charlemagne's power, religious power. Legend has it that the building was consecrated in 805 by [[Pope Leo III]],<ref name=\"Art76\"/> in honour of the [[Virgin Mary]], Mother of Christ.\n\nSeveral buildings used by the clerics of the chapel were arranged in the shape of a [[latin cross]]: a [[curia]] in the East, offices in the North and South, and a projecting part (''Westbau''<ref>A porch surrounded with two stair towers, la forerunner of Westworks</ref>) and an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] with [[exedrae]] in the West. But the center piece was the chapel, covered with a 16,54 meters wide and 31 meters high octagonal [[cupola]].<ref>Collectif, ''Le grand atlas de l\u2019architecture mondiale'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis, 1982, {{ISBN|2-85229-971-2}}, p. 1888</ref><ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 505</ref> Eight massive pillars receive the thrust of large [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]]. The [[nave]] on the first floor, located under the cupola, is surrounded by an [[aisle]]; here stood the Palace servants.<ref>G. D\u00e9mians d\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', 1992, p. 81</ref>\n\nThe two additional floors ([[Tribune (Architecture)|tribunes]]) open on the central space through semicircular arches supported by columns. The inner side takes the shape of an [[octagon]] whereas the outer side develops into a sixteen-sided [[polygon]]. The chapel had two [[Choir (architecture)|choirs]] located in the East and West. The king sat on a [[throne]] made of white marble plates, in the West of the second floor, surrounded by his closer courtiers. Thus he had a view on the three [[altars]]: that of the [[Jesus|Savior]] right in front of him, that of the [[Virgin Mary]] on the first floor and that of [[Peter (apostle)|Saint Peter]] in the far end of the Western choir.\n\nCharlemagne wanted his chapel to be magnificently decorated, so he had massive [[bronze]] doors made in a foundry near Aachen. The walls were covered with [[marble]] and [[polychrome]] stone.<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 127</ref> The columns, still visible today, were taken from buildings in [[Ravenna]] and [[Rome]], with the Pope's permission.\n\nThe walls and cupola were covered with [[mosaic]], enhanced by both artificial lights and exterior light coming in through the windows. [[Eginhard]] provides a description of the inside in his ''Life of Charlemagne'' (c. 825\u2013826):\n\n{{Quotation|[...] Hence it was that he [Charlemagne] built the beautiful basilica at Aachen, which he adorned with gold and silver and lamps, and with rails and doors of solid brass. He had the columns and marbles for this structure brought from Rome and Ravenna, for he could not find such as were suitable elsewhere. [...] He provided it with a great number of sacred vessels of gold and silver and with such a quantity of clerical robes that not even the doorkeepers who fill the humblest office in the church were obliged to wear their everyday clothes when in the exercise of their duties.<ref name=\"fordham\">Source : Einhard: \"The Life of Charlemagne\", translated by Samuel Epes Turner (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1880). http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.html</ref>}}\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n[[Odo of Metz]] applied the [[Christian symbolism]] for figures and numbers. The building was conceived as a representation of the [[heavenly Jerusalem]], the Kingdom of God, as described in the ''[[Apocalypse]]''.<ref>''Apocalypse'', XXI, 17. [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Apocalypse#Apocalypse_20 Read online] at Wikisource (French).</ref> The outer perimeter of the cupola measures exactly 144 Carolingian feet whereas that of the heavenly Jerusalem, ideal city drawn by [[angels]], is of 144 [[cubits]]. The mosaic of the cupola, hidden today behind a 19th-century restoration, showed [[Christ in Majesty]] with the 24 elders of the Apocalypse. Other mosaics, on the [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] of the aisle, takes up this subject by representing the heavenly Jerusalem. Charlemagne's throne, located in the West of the second floor, was placed on the seventh step of a platform.<ref>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Robin, ''L\u2019Allemagne m\u00e9di\u00e9vale'', Paris, Armand Colin, 1998, {{ISBN|2-200-21883-4}}, p. 136</ref>\n\n== Other buildings ==\n=== Treasury and archives ===\nThe [[treasury]] and [[archives]] of the palace were located in a tower tied to the great hall, in the North of the complex.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/><ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\"/> The [[Grand Chamberman of France|chamberman]] was the officer liable for the rulers' treasury and wardrobe. Finance administration fell on the [[archichaplain]], assisted by a [[treasurer]].<ref>Jean-Pierre Brunterc\u2019h, ''Archives de la France'', tome 1 (V<sup>e</sup> \u2013 XI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle), Paris, Fayard, {{ISBN|2-213-03180-0}}, p. 244</ref> The treasury gathered gifts brought by the kingdom's important people during the general assemblies or by foreign envoys. This made up an heterogeneous collection of objects ranging from precious books to weapons and clothing. The king would also buy items from merchants visiting Aachen.\n\nThe [[chancellor]] was liable for the archives. The chancellery employed several scribes and notaries who wrote down [[diplomas]], [[capitularies]] and royal correspondence. Agents of the king's offices were mostly [[clergymen]] of the chapel.\n\n=== Gallery ===\n[[File:Aix gallerie.svg|thumb|Location of the gallery within the Palace (red)]]\nThe covered gallery was a hundred meters long. It linked the council hall to the chapel; a monumental [[porch]] in its middle was used as the main entrance. A room for legal hearing was located on the second floor. The king dispensed justice in this place, although affairs in which important people were involved were handled in the ''aula regia''. When the king was away, this task fell on the [[count of the Palace]]. The building was also probably used as a [[garrison]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/>\n\n=== Thermae ===\n[[File:Aix thermes.svg|thumb|left|Location of the thermae (red)]]\nThe [[Thermae|thermal complex]], located in the Southeast, measured 50 acres and included several buildings near the sources of the Emperor and [[Quirinus]]. [[Eginhard]] mentions a [[swimming pool]] that could accommodate one hundred swimmers at a time:<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 105</ref>\n{{Quotation|[...] [Charlemagne] enjoyed the exhalations from natural warm springs, and often practised swimming, in which he was such an adept that none could surpass him; and hence it was that he built his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle, and lived there constantly during his latter years until his death. He used not only to invite his sons to his bath, but his nobles and friends, and now and then a troop of his retinue or body guard, so that a hundred or more persons sometimes bathed with him.<ref name=\"fordham\" />}}\n\n=== Other buildings for other functions ===\n[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|The ''Codex aureus'' of Lorsch was made in one of Aachen's palace workshops around 810]]\nThe other buildings are not easy to identify because of the lack of detailed enough written accounts. Charlemagne's and his family's apartments seem to have been located in the north-eastern part of the palace complex; his room may have been on the second floor.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/> Some of the [[servants]] of the palace must have lived in the western part,<ref name=\"Erlande104\"/><ref>G. D\u00e9mians d\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', 1992, p. 78</ref> and some in the city. The Emperor is said to have owned a library<ref>existence is attested by Eginhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', traduction et \u00e9dition de Louis Halphen, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1994, p. 99</ref> but its exact location is hard to assess. The palace also housed other areas dedicated to artistic creation: a [[scriptorium]] that saw the writing of several precious manuscripts (''[[Drogo Sacramentary]]'', ''[[Godescalc Evangelistary]]''\u2026), a goldsmith workshop<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 513</ref> and  an [[ivory]] workshop. There was also a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] that was still operational in the 13th century.\n\nThe palace also housed the literary activities of the Palace Academy. This circle of scholars did not gather in a definite building: Charlemagne liked to listen to poems while he was swimming and eating. The Palace school provided education to the ruler's children and the \"nourished ones\" (''nutriti'' in Latin), aristocrat sons that were to serve the king.\n\nOutside of the palace complex were also a [[gynaeceum]], [[barracks]], a [[hospice]],<ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\"/> a hunting park and a [[menagerie]] in which lived the elephant [[Abul-Abbas]], given by [[Baghdad]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. [[Ermoldus Nigellus]] describes the place in his ''Poems on Louis the Pious'' (first half of the 9th century).\n\nThe place was frequented everyday by crowds of people: courtiers, scholars, aristocrats, merchants but also beggars and poor people that came to ask for [[Charity (practice)|charity]].<ref>Jean-Pierre Brunterc\u2019h, ''Archives de la France'', tome 1 (V<sup>e</sup> \u2013 XI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle), Paris, Fayard, {{ISBN|2-213-03180-0}}, p. 243</ref> Internal affairs were the task of [[Police officer|officers]] such as [[butler]], le [[seneschal]], the [[Grand Chamberman of France|chamberman]].<ref>On the palace organization, refer to the description by Rheims Archbishop [[Hincmar]], ''Lettre sur l\u2019organisation du Palais'', Paris, Pal\u00e9o, 2002, {{ISBN|2-913944-63-9}}</ref>{{clr}}\n\n== Symbolic interpretation of the Palace ==\n\n=== Roman legacy and Byzantine model ===\n[[File:San Vitale Ravenna.jpg|thumb|left|San Vitale Basilica in Ravenna was one of the models for the Palatine Chapel]]\nThe palace borrows several elements of Roman civilization: the ''aula palatina'' follows a basilical plan; [[basilicas]] in ancient times were public buildings where the city affairs were discussed. The chapel follows models from ancient Rome: grids exhibit antique decorations ([[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]<ref>G. D\u00e9mians d\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', 1992, p. 80</ref>) and columns are topped by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]]. The Emperor was buried in the Palatine Chapel within a 2nd-century marble [[sarcophagus]] decorated with a depiction of the abduction of [[Proserpina]].<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/><ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 592</ref> Scholars of Charlemagne's time nicknamed Aachen \u00abthe Second Rome\u00bb.\n\nCharlemagne wished to compete with the other emperor of the time, the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Basileus of Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Rich\u00e9326\"/> The cupola and mosaics of the chapel are Byzantine elements. The plan itself is probably inspired by the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]] built by [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century. Other experts point at similarities with the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]] and Constantinople's [[Chrysotriklinos]], the main throne room in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]]. During religious offices, Charlemagne stood in the second floor gallery, as did the Emperor in [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/>\n\n[[Odo of Metz]] was also likely inspired by the 8th-century [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard]] palace of [[Pavia]] where the  chapel was decorated with mosaics and paintings.<ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\"/> Although he may have travelled to Italy, it is unlikely that he may have been to Constantinople.\n\n=== Frankish style ===\nAlthough many references to Roman and Byzantine models are visible in Aachen's buildings, [[Odo of Metz]] expressed his talent of Frankish architect and brought undeniably different elements. The palace is also distinguishable from [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] architecture by its large scale and the multiplicity of volumes.<ref>Piotr Skubiszewski, ''L\u2019art du Haut Moyen \u00c2ge'', Paris, Librairie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale fran\u00e7aise, 1998, {{ISBN|2-253-13056-7}}, p. 287</ref> The vaulting of the chapel illustrates an original Carolingian expertise,<ref>Collective, ''Le grand atlas de l\u2019architecture mondiale'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis, 1982, {{ISBN|2-85229-971-2}}, p. 1888</ref> especially in the [[ambulatory]] topped with a [[groin vault]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/> Whereas Byzantine emperors sat in the East to watch offices, Charlemagne sat in the West. Last, wooden buildings and half-timbering techniques were typical of Northern Europe.\n\nCharlemagne's palace was thus more than a copy of Classical and Byzantine models: it was rather a synthesis of various influences, as a reflection of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. Just like [[Carolingian Renaissance]], the palace was a product of the assimilation of several cultures and legacies.\n\n=== Imperial centralization and unity ===\nThe layout of the palatine complex perfectly implemented the alliance between two powers: the spiritual power was represented by the chapel in the South and the temporal power by the Council hall in the North. Both poles were linked by the gallery. Since [[Pepin the Short]], Charlemagne's father, Carolingian kings were sacred and received their power from God. Charlemagne himself wanted to influence religious matters through his reforms and the numerous [[ecumenical council]] and [[synods]] held in Aachen. By establishing the seat of the power and the court in Aachen, Charlemagne knew he would be able to supervise more easily those close to him. The palace was the heart of the capital city, a place that gathered dignitaries from all over the Empire.\n\n== After Charlemagne ==\n\n=== Model for other palaces? ===\n[[File:Ottmarsheim 7.JPG|thumb|Inside Ottmarsheim's dome, Alsace]]\n\nIt is difficult to know whether other Carolingian palaces did imitate that of Aachen, as most of them have been destroyed. However, the constructions of Aachen were not the only ones undertaken under Charlemagne: 16 [[cathedrals]], 232 [[monasteries]] and 65 royal palaces were built between 768 and 814.<ref>M. Durliat, ''Des barbares \u00e0 l\u2019an Mil'', 1985, p. 148</ref>\nThe Palatine Chapel of Aachen seems to have been imitated by several other buildings of the same kind: The octagonal [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] of [[Germigny-des-Pr\u00e9s]], built in the early 9th century for [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans]] seems to have been directly related. The [[Collegiate church]] of [[Li\u00e8ge]] was built in the 10th century following the plan of the palatine chapel. [[Ottmarsheim]] church in [[Alsace]] also adopts a centered plan but was built later (11th century). The influence of Aachen's chapel is also found in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''La vie quotidienne dans l\u2019Empire carolingien'', p. 59</ref> and in other German religious buildings (such as the Abbey church of [[Essen]]).\n\n=== Palace history after Charlemagne ===\nCharlemagne was buried in the chapel in 814. His son and successor, [[Carolingian Empire|Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]], used the palace of Aachen without making it his exclusive residence. He used to stay there in the winter<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/> until [[Easter]]. Several important [[Councils]] were held in Aix in the early 9th century.<ref>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Robin, ''L\u2019Allemagne m\u00e9di\u00e9vale'', Paris, Armand Colin, 1998, {{ISBN|2-200-21883-4}}, p. 35</ref> Those of 817 and 836 took place in the buildings adjacent to the chapel.<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/> In 817, Louis the Pious had his elder son [[Lothair I|Lothair]] in the presence of the Frankish people.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, the Carolingian Empire was split into three kingdoms. Aachen was then included into [[Middle Francia]]. [[Lothair I]] (840\u2013855) and [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] (855\u2013869) lived in the palace.<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/> When this one died, the palace lost its political and cultural significance. [[Lotharingia]] became a field of rivalry between the kings of [[West Francia|West]] and [[East Francia]]. It was split several times and finally fell under the control of [[Germany]] under [[Henry I the Fowler]] (876\u2013936).\n\n[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|left|View of the cathedral today]]\n\nYet the memory of Charlemagne's Empire remained fresh and became a symbol of German power: in the 10th century, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] (912\u2013973) was crowned King of Germany in Aachen<ref>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Robin, ''L\u2019Allemagne m\u00e9di\u00e9vale'', Paris, Armand Colin, 1998, {{ISBN|2-200-21883-4}}, p. 40</ref> (936). The ceremony took place in three steps in several locations of the palace: first in the courtyard (election by the [[dukes]]), then in the chapel (handing of the insignia of the Kingdom), finally in the palace (banquet).<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens. Une famille qui fit l\u2019Europe'', 1983, p. 247</ref> During the ceremony, Otto had sat on Charlemagne's throne. Afterwards, and until the 16th century, all the German Emperors were crowned first in Aachen and then in Rome, which highlights the attachment to Charlemagne's political legacy. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] confirmed that coronations were to take place in the palatine chapel.\n\n[[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] (955\u2013983) lived in Aachen with his wife [[Theophanu]]. In the summer of 978 [[Lothair of France]] led a raid on [[Aachen]] but the Imperial family avoided capture. Relating these events, [[Richer of Reims]] states the existence of a bronze eagle, which exact location is unknown:\n\n{{Quotation|[...] The bronze eagle, that Charlemagne had put on top of the palace in a flight attitude, has been turned back towards the East. The Germans had turned it towards the West to symbolize that their cavalry could beat the French whenever they wanted [...].<ref>Richer, ''Histoire de France (888\u2013995)'', tome 2, edition and translation by Robert Latouche, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1964, p. 89</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Aachen2.jpg|thumb|Aachen's city hall is today located on the site of the Council hall]]\n\nIn 881, a [[Viking]] raid damaged the palace and the chapel. In 1000, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] had Charlemagne's tomb opened. According to two 11th-century chroniclers, he would have been found sitting on his throne, wearing his crown and holding his [[scepter]].<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 590</ref> However, Eginhard does not mention it in his biography of the Emperor. At the same time the veneration of Charlemagne began to attract [[pilgrims]] to the chapel. In the 12th century, [[Frederick Barbarossa]] placed the body of the Carolingian Emperor into a  [[reliquary]] interceded with the Pope for his  [[canonization]]; the [[relics]] were scattered across the empire. The treasure of Aachen began to grow with the numerous gifts of French and German kings and princes.\n\nBetween 1355 and 1414, an [[apse]] was added to the East of the Chapel. The city hall was built from 1267 on the location of the Council Hall. During the [[French Revolution]], the French occupied Aachen and looted the treasure. Before choosing [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] had considered for a time having his Imperial coronation take place in Aachen.<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 691</ref> The chapel was restored in 1884.

The palace was located at the north of the current city of [[Aachen]], today in the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|Land]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Most of the Carolingian palace was built in the 790s but the works went on until Charlemagne's death in 814. The plans, drawn by [[Odo of Metz]], were part with the programme of renovation of the kingdom decided by the ruler. Today much of the palace is destroyed, but the Palatine Chapel has been preserved and is considered as a masterpiece of [[Carolingian architecture]] and a characteristic example of architecture from the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\n[[File:AixGeneral.GIF|thumb|Simplified plan: 1 = council hall ; 2 = porch ; 3 = treasury and archives ; 4 = gallery ; 5 = tribunal and garrison ; 6 = metatorium ; 7 = curia ; 8 = secretarium ; 9 = chapel ; 10 = atrium ; 11 = thermae]]\n\n== Historical context ==\n\n=== The palace before Charlemagne ===\n[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|The construction of Aachen, [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]] by [[Jean Fouquet]], in the ''Grandes Chroniques de France'', 15th century.

Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 285</ref> The Roman city grew in connection with the ''thermae'' according to a classical [[grid plan]] similar to that of [[castra|Roman legions' camps]]. A palace was used to accommodate the [[Roman governor|governor]] of the [[Roman province|province]] or the Emperor. In the 4th century, the city and the palace were destroyed during the [[Migration Period|Barbarian invasions]]. [[Clovis I|Clovis]] made [[Paris]] the capital of the [[Frankish Kingdom]], and Aachen Palace was abandoned until the advent of the Carolingian dynasty. The [[Pippinid]] [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]] carried out some restoration works, but it was at the time only one residence among others. The Frankish court was itinerant and the rulers moved according to the circumstances. Around 765, [[Pepin the Short]] had a palace erected over the remains of the old Roman building; he had the thermae restored and removed its [[pagan]] [[cult image|idols]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\">P. Rich\u00e9, ''La vie quotidienne dans l\u2019Empire carolingien'', p. 57</ref> As soon as he came to power in 768, Charlemagne spent time in Aachen as well as in other [[villa]]s in [[Austrasia]].<ref name=\"Favier285\"/> In the 790s, he decided to settle down in order to govern his kingdom, then his empire more efficiently.\n\n=== The choice of Aachen ===\n[[File:AachenKarlDerGrosse.jpg|thumb|Statue of Charlemagne in front of Aachen's city hall]]\n\nThe site of Aachen was chosen by Charlemagne after careful consideration in a key moment of his reign.<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 92</ref> Since his advent as King of the Franks, Charlemagne had led numerous military expeditions that had both filled his treasury and enlarged his realm, most notably towards the East. He conquered [[pagan]] [[Old Saxony|Saxony]] in 772\u2013780, but this area resisted and the war with the [[Saxons]] lasted for about thirty years. Charlemagne ended the Germanic custom of an itinerant court moving from place to place and established a real capital. As he was ageing, he decreased the frequency of military expeditions and, after 806, virtually did not leave Aachen.<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 582</ref>\n\nAachen's geographic location was a decisive factor in Charlemagne's choice: the place was situated in the Carolingian heartlands of [[Austrasia]], the cradle of his family, East of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] river, at a crossroads of land roads and on a [[tributary]] of the [[Rur]], called the [[Wurm]]. From then, Charlemagne left the administration of the Southern regions to his son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], named [[King of Aquitaine]],<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 287</ref> which enabled him to reside in the North.\n\n[[File:Empire carolingien 768-811-2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Carolingian Empire]] and its capital, Aachen, in the early 9th century.]]\n\nBesides, settling down in Aachen enabled Charlemagne to control from closer the operations in Saxony.<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, pp. 92\u201393</ref> Charlemagne also considered other advantages of the place: surrounded with forest abounding in game, he intended to abandon himself to [[hunting]] in the area.<ref name=\"Art76\">G. D\u00e9mians d\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', 1992, p. 76</ref> The ageing emperor could also benefit from Aachen's hot springs.\n\nThe scholars of the Carolingian era presented Charlemagne as the \"New [[Constantine I|Constantine]]\"; in this context, he needed a capital and a palace worthy of the name.<ref name=\"Rich\u00e9326\">P.

The rivalry with the [[Byzantine Empire]]<ref name=\"Art76\"/> led Charlemagne to build a magnificent palace. The fire that destroyed his palace in [[Worms (city)|Worms]] in 793<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 288</ref> also encouraged him to follow such a plan.\n\n{{-}}\n\n=== Importance of the project entrusted to Odo of Metz ===\n[[File:Eginhard \u00e9crivant.jpg|thumb|Eginhard is Charlemagne's biographer; the name of the architect of the Palace of Aachen is known thanks to his work (14th/15th-century illumination)]]\nHistorians know almost nothing about the architect of the Palace of Aachen, [[Odo of Metz]]. His name appears in the works of [[Eginhard]] (c. 775\u2013840), Charlemagne's [[biographer]]. He is supposed to have been an educated cleric, familiar with [[liberal arts]], especially ''[[quadrivia]]''. He had probably read [[Vitruvius]]' treatise on architecture, ''[[De Architectura]]''.<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 502</ref>\n\nThe decision to build the palace was taken in the late 780s or the early 790s, before Charlemagne held the title of emperor. Works began in 794<ref>Christian Bonnet (dir.), ''Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s en Europe (milieu du VI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle \u2013 fin du IX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle)'', Paris, Ellipses, 2002, {{ISBN|978-2729812317}}, p. 184</ref> and went on for several years. Aachen quickly became the favourite residence of the sovereign. After 807, he almost did not leave it any more. In the absence of sufficient documentation, it is impossible to know the number of workers employed, but the dimensions of the building make it probable that there were many of them.\n\nThe geometry of the plan chosen was very simple: Odo of Metz decided to keep the layout of the Roman roads and inscribe the square in 360 Carolingian [[foot (unit)|feet]], or 120 metres-side square.<ref>A Carolingian foot corresponds to 0,333 metres</ref><ref name=\"Erlande103\">A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 103</ref> The square enclosed an area of 50 acres<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens \u2026'', 1983, p. 325</ref> divided in four parts by a North-South axis (the stone gallery) and an East-West axis (the former [[Roman road]], the [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]). To the north of this square lay the council hall, to the south the Palatine Chapel. The architect drew a triangle toward the East to connect the thermae to the palace complex. The two best-known buildings are the council hall (today disappeared) and the Palatine Chapel, included into the [[Aachen Cathedral|Cathedral]]. The other buildings are hardly identified.<ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\">R\u00e9gine Le Jan, ''La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Haut Moyen \u00c2ge, VI<sup>e</sup> \u2013 IX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle'', Paris, Armand Colin, 2003, {{ISBN|2-200-26577-8}}, p. 120</ref> Often built in [[timber framing]], made of [[wood]] and [[brick]], they have been destroyed. Lastly, the palace complex was surrounded with a wall.<ref name=\"Viequot58\">P. Rich\u00e9, ''La vie quotidienne dans l\u2019Empire carolingien'', p. 58</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the court in Aachen and the construction work stimulated the activity in the city that experienced growth in the late 8th century and the early 9th century, as craftsmen, traders and shopkeepers had settled near the court. Some important ones lived in houses inside the city. The members of the Palace Academy and Charlemagne's advisors such as [[Eginhard]] and [[Angilbert]] owned houses near the palace.<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/>\n\n== Council Hall ==\n[[File:Aix salle des assembl\u00e9es.svg|thumb|Location of the hall within the Palace (red)]]\n\nLocated at the North of the Palace complex, the great Council Hall (''[[aula regia]]'' or ''aula palatina'' in Latin) was used to house the speeches delivered by the Emperor once a year. This occasion gathered the highest officials in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] Empire, dignitaries and the hierarchy of the power: [[counts]], [[vassals]] of the king, [[bishops]] and [[abbots]]. The general assembly was usually held in May. Participants discussed important political and legal affairs. [[Capitularies]], written by [[amanuenses]] of the Aachen [[chancellor|chancellery]], summed up the decisions taken. In this building also took place official ceremonies and the reception of [[embassies]]. Describing the coronation of Louis, son of Charlemagne, [[Ermold the Black]] states that there Charlemagne \"spoke down from his golden seat.\"<ref>Ermold le Noir, ''Po\u00e8me sur Louis le Pieux et \u00e9p\u00eetres au roi P\u00e9pin'', \u00e9dit\u00e9 et traduit par Edmond Faral, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1964, p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:Trier Konstantinbasilika BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Aula Palatina|Constantine Basilica]] in Trier, Germany was probably used as a model for Aachen's Council Hall]]\n\nThe dimensions of the hall (1,000 m<sup>2</sup>) were suitable to the reception of several hundreds of people at the same time:<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens. Une famille qui fit l\u2019Europe'', 1983, p. 131</ref> although the building has been destroyed, it is known it was 47,42 metres long, 20,76 metres large and 21 metres high.<ref name=\"Erlande103\"/> The plan seems to be based upon the Roman ''[[Aula Palatina|aula palatina]]'' of [[Trier]]. The structure was made of brick, and the shape was that of a civil [[basilica]] with three [[apse]]s: the largest one (17,2 m),<ref name=\"Erlande103\"/> located to the West, was dedicated to the king and his suite. The two other apses, to the North and South, were smaller. Light entered through two rows of windows. The inside was probably decorated with paintings depicting heroes both from the Ancient times and contemporary.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/> A wooden gallery girdled the building between the two rows of windows. From this gallery could be seen the [[Market (place)|market]] that was held North of the Palace. A gallery with [[porticos]] on the southern side of the hall gave access to the building. The southern apse cut through the middle of this entrance.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/>{{clr}}\n\n== Palatine Chapel ==\n{{Main article|Palatine Chapel in Aachen}}\n\n=== Description ===\n[[File:Aachen Dehio 1887.jpg|thumb|upright|Section of the Palatine Chapel]]\n[[File:Aachener Dom Portal Bronzetore 2014.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Bronze portal (''Wolfst\u00fcr'')]]\n\nThe Palatine Chapel was located at the other side of the palace complex, at the South. A stone gallery linked it to the ''aula regia''. It symbolized another aspect of Charlemagne's power, religious power. Legend has it that the building was consecrated in 805 by [[Pope Leo III]],<ref name=\"Art76\"/> in honour of the [[Virgin Mary]], Mother of Christ.\n\nSeveral buildings used by the clerics of the chapel were arranged in the shape of a [[latin cross]]: a [[curia]] in the East, offices in the North and South, and a projecting part (''Westbau''<ref>A porch surrounded with two stair towers, la forerunner of Westworks</ref>) and an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] with [[exedrae]] in the West. But the center piece was the chapel, covered with a 16,54 meters wide and 31 meters high octagonal [[cupola]].<ref>Collectif, ''Le grand atlas de l\u2019architecture mondiale'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis, 1982, {{ISBN|2-85229-971-2}}, p. 1888</ref><ref>J.

The inner side takes the shape of an [[octagon]] whereas the outer side develops into a sixteen-sided [[polygon]]. The chapel had two [[Choir (architecture)|choirs]] located in the East and West. The king sat on a [[throne]] made of white marble plates, in the West of the second floor, surrounded by his closer courtiers. Thus he had a view on the three [[altars]]: that of the [[Jesus|Savior]] right in front of him, that of the [[Virgin Mary]] on the first floor and that of [[Peter (apostle)|Saint Peter]] in the far end of the Western choir.\n\nCharlemagne wanted his chapel to be magnificently decorated, so he had massive [[bronze]] doors made in a foundry near Aachen. The walls were covered with [[marble]] and [[polychrome]] stone.<ref>A. Erlande-Brandeburg, A.-B. Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise'', 1999, p. 127</ref> The columns, still visible today, were taken from buildings in [[Ravenna]] and [[Rome]], with the Pope's permission.\n\nThe walls and cupola were covered with [[mosaic]], enhanced by both artificial lights and exterior light coming in through the windows. [[Eginhard]] provides a description of the inside in his ''Life of Charlemagne'' (c. 825\u2013826):\n\n{{Quotation|[...] Hence it was that he [Charlemagne] built the beautiful basilica at Aachen, which he adorned with gold and silver and lamps, and with rails and doors of solid brass. He had the columns and marbles for this structure brought from Rome and Ravenna, for he could not find such as were suitable elsewhere. [...] He provided it with a great number of sacred vessels of gold and silver and with such a quantity of clerical robes that not even the doorkeepers who fill the humblest office in the church were obliged to wear their everyday clothes when in the exercise of their duties.<ref name=\"fordham\">Source : Einhard: \"The Life of Charlemagne\", translated by Samuel Epes Turner (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1880). http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.html</ref>}}\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n[[Odo of Metz]] applied the [[Christian symbolism]] for figures and numbers.

[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Apocalypse#Apocalypse_20 Read online] at Wikisource (French).</ref> The outer perimeter of the cupola measures exactly 144 Carolingian feet whereas that of the heavenly Jerusalem, ideal city drawn by [[angels]], is of 144 [[cubits]]. The mosaic of the cupola, hidden today behind a 19th-century restoration, showed [[Christ in Majesty]] with the 24 elders of the Apocalypse. Other mosaics, on the [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] of the aisle, takes up this subject by representing the heavenly Jerusalem. Charlemagne's throne, located in the West of the second floor, was placed on the seventh step of a platform.<ref>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Robin, ''L\u2019Allemagne m\u00e9di\u00e9vale'', Paris, Armand Colin, 1998, {{ISBN|2-200-21883-4}}, p. 136</ref>\n\n== Other buildings ==\n=== Treasury and archives ===\nThe [[treasury]] and [[archives]] of the palace were located in a tower tied to the great hall, in the North of the complex.<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/><ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\"/> The [[Grand Chamberman of France|chamberman]] was the officer liable for the rulers' treasury and wardrobe.

This made up an heterogeneous collection of objects ranging from precious books to weapons and clothing. The king would also buy items from merchants visiting Aachen.\n\nThe [[chancellor]] was liable for the archives. The chancellery employed several scribes and notaries who wrote down [[diplomas]], [[capitularies]] and royal correspondence. Agents of the king's offices were mostly [[clergymen]] of the chapel.\n\n=== Gallery ===\n[[File:Aix gallerie.svg|thumb|Location of the gallery within the Palace (red)]]\nThe covered gallery was a hundred meters long. It linked the council hall to the chapel; a monumental [[porch]] in its middle was used as the main entrance. A room for legal hearing was located on the second floor. The king dispensed justice in this place, although affairs in which important people were involved were handled in the ''aula regia''. When the king was away, this task fell on the [[count of the Palace]]. The building was also probably used as a [[garrison]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/>\n\n=== Thermae ===\n[[File:Aix thermes.svg|thumb|left|Location of the thermae (red)]]\nThe [[Thermae|thermal complex]], located in the Southeast, measured 50 acres and included several buildings near the sources of the Emperor and [[Quirinus]].

The Emperor is said to have owned a library<ref>existence is attested by Eginhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', traduction et \u00e9dition de Louis Halphen, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1994, p. 99</ref> but its exact location is hard to assess. The palace also housed other areas dedicated to artistic creation: a [[scriptorium]] that saw the writing of several precious manuscripts (''[[Drogo Sacramentary]]'', ''[[Godescalc Evangelistary]]''\u2026), a goldsmith workshop<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 513</ref> and  an [[ivory]] workshop. There was also a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] that was still operational in the 13th century.\n\nThe palace also housed the literary activities of the Palace Academy. This circle of scholars did not gather in a definite building: Charlemagne liked to listen to poems while he was swimming and eating. The Palace school provided education to the ruler's children and the \"nourished ones\" (''nutriti'' in Latin), aristocrat sons that were to serve the king.\n\nOutside of the palace complex were also a [[gynaeceum]], [[barracks]], a [[hospice]],<ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\"/> a hunting park and a [[menagerie]] in which lived the elephant [[Abul-Abbas]], given by [[Baghdad]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. [[Ermoldus Nigellus]] describes the place in his ''Poems on Louis the Pious'' (first half of the 9th century).\n\nThe place was frequented everyday by crowds of people: courtiers, scholars, aristocrats, merchants but also beggars and poor people that came to ask for [[Charity (practice)|charity]].<ref>Jean-Pierre Brunterc\u2019h, ''Archives de la France'', tome 1 (V<sup>e</sup> \u2013 XI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle), Paris, Fayard, {{ISBN|2-213-03180-0}}, p. 243</ref> Internal affairs were the task of [[Police officer|officers]] such as [[butler]], le [[seneschal]], the [[Grand Chamberman of France|chamberman]].<ref>On the palace organization, refer to the description by Rheims Archbishop [[Hincmar]], ''Lettre sur l\u2019organisation du Palais'', Paris, Pal\u00e9o, 2002, {{ISBN|2-913944-63-9}}</ref>{{clr}}\n\n== Symbolic interpretation of the Palace ==\n\n=== Roman legacy and Byzantine model ===\n[[File:San Vitale Ravenna.jpg|thumb|left|San Vitale Basilica in Ravenna was one of the models for the Palatine Chapel]]\nThe palace borrows several elements of Roman civilization: the ''aula palatina'' follows a basilical plan; [[basilicas]] in ancient times were public buildings where the city affairs were discussed. The chapel follows models from ancient Rome: grids exhibit antique decorations ([[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]<ref>G. D\u00e9mians d\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', 1992, p. 80</ref>) and columns are topped by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]]. The Emperor was buried in the Palatine Chapel within a 2nd-century marble [[sarcophagus]] decorated with a depiction of the abduction of [[Proserpina]].<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/><ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 592</ref> Scholars of Charlemagne's time nicknamed Aachen \u00abthe Second Rome\u00bb.\n\nCharlemagne wished to compete with the other emperor of the time, the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Basileus of Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Rich\u00e9326\"/> The cupola and mosaics of the chapel are Byzantine elements. The plan itself is probably inspired by the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]] built by [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century. Other experts point at similarities with the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]] and Constantinople's [[Chrysotriklinos]], the main throne room in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]]. During religious offices, Charlemagne stood in the second floor gallery, as did the Emperor in [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/>\n\n[[Odo of Metz]] was also likely inspired by the 8th-century [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard]] palace of [[Pavia]] where the  chapel was decorated with mosaics and paintings.<ref name=\"ParisArmandColin120\"/> Although he may have travelled to Italy, it is unlikely that he may have been to Constantinople.\n\n=== Frankish style ===\nAlthough many references to Roman and Byzantine models are visible in Aachen's buildings, [[Odo of Metz]] expressed his talent of Frankish architect and brought undeniably different elements. The palace is also distinguishable from [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] architecture by its large scale and the multiplicity of volumes.<ref>Piotr Skubiszewski, ''L\u2019art du Haut Moyen \u00c2ge'', Paris, Librairie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale fran\u00e7aise, 1998, {{ISBN|2-253-13056-7}}, p. 287</ref> The vaulting of the chapel illustrates an original Carolingian expertise,<ref>Collective, ''Le grand atlas de l\u2019architecture mondiale'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis, 1982, {{ISBN|2-85229-971-2}}, p. 1888</ref> especially in the [[ambulatory]] topped with a [[groin vault]].<ref name=\"Viequot57\"/> Whereas Byzantine emperors sat in the East to watch offices, Charlemagne sat in the West. Last, wooden buildings and half-timbering techniques were typical of Northern Europe.\n\nCharlemagne's palace was thus more than a copy of Classical and Byzantine models: it was rather a synthesis of various influences, as a reflection of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. Just like [[Carolingian Renaissance]], the palace was a product of the assimilation of several cultures and legacies.\n\n=== Imperial centralization and unity ===\nThe layout of the palatine complex perfectly implemented the alliance between two powers: the spiritual power was represented by the chapel in the South and the temporal power by the Council hall in the North. Both poles were linked by the gallery. Since [[Pepin the Short]], Charlemagne's father, Carolingian kings were sacred and received their power from God. Charlemagne himself wanted to influence religious matters through his reforms and the numerous [[ecumenical council]] and [[synods]] held in Aachen. By establishing the seat of the power and the court in Aachen, Charlemagne knew he would be able to supervise more easily those close to him. The palace was the heart of the capital city, a place that gathered dignitaries from all over the Empire.\n\n== After Charlemagne ==\n\n=== Model for other palaces? ===\n[[File:Ottmarsheim 7.JPG|thumb|Inside Ottmarsheim's dome, Alsace]]\n\nIt is difficult to know whether other Carolingian palaces did imitate that of Aachen, as most of them have been destroyed. However, the constructions of Aachen were not the only ones undertaken under Charlemagne: 16 [[cathedrals]], 232 [[monasteries]] and 65 royal palaces were built between 768 and 814.<ref>M. Durliat, ''Des barbares \u00e0 l\u2019an Mil'', 1985, p. 148</ref>\nThe Palatine Chapel of Aachen seems to have been imitated by several other buildings of the same kind: The octagonal [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] of [[Germigny-des-Pr\u00e9s]], built in the early 9th century for [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans]] seems to have been directly related. The [[Collegiate church]] of [[Li\u00e8ge]] was built in the 10th century following the plan of the palatine chapel. [[Ottmarsheim]] church in [[Alsace]] also adopts a centered plan but was built later (11th century). The influence of Aachen's chapel is also found in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''La vie quotidienne dans l\u2019Empire carolingien'', p. 59</ref> and in other German religious buildings (such as the Abbey church of [[Essen]]).\n\n=== Palace history after Charlemagne ===\nCharlemagne was buried in the chapel in 814. His son and successor, [[Carolingian Empire|Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]], used the palace of Aachen without making it his exclusive residence. He used to stay there in the winter<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/> until [[Easter]]. Several important [[Councils]] were held in Aix in the early 9th century.<ref>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Robin, ''L\u2019Allemagne m\u00e9di\u00e9vale'', Paris, Armand Colin, 1998, {{ISBN|2-200-21883-4}}, p. 35</ref> Those of 817 and 836 took place in the buildings adjacent to the chapel.<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/> In 817, Louis the Pious had his elder son [[Lothair I|Lothair]] in the presence of the Frankish people.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, the Carolingian Empire was split into three kingdoms. Aachen was then included into [[Middle Francia]]. [[Lothair I]] (840\u2013855) and [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] (855\u2013869) lived in the palace.<ref name=\"Viequot58\"/> When this one died, the palace lost its political and cultural significance. [[Lotharingia]] became a field of rivalry between the kings of [[West Francia|West]] and [[East Francia]]. It was split several times and finally fell under the control of [[Germany]] under [[Henry I the Fowler]] (876\u2013936).\n\n[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|left|View of the cathedral today]]\n\nYet the memory of Charlemagne's Empire remained fresh and became a symbol of German power: in the 10th century, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] (912\u2013973) was crowned King of Germany in Aachen<ref>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Robin, ''L\u2019Allemagne m\u00e9di\u00e9vale'', Paris, Armand Colin, 1998, {{ISBN|2-200-21883-4}}, p. 40</ref> (936). The ceremony took place in three steps in several locations of the palace: first in the courtyard (election by the [[dukes]]), then in the chapel (handing of the insignia of the Kingdom), finally in the palace (banquet).<ref>P. Rich\u00e9, ''Les Carolingiens. Une famille qui fit l\u2019Europe'', 1983, p. 247</ref> During the ceremony, Otto had sat on Charlemagne's throne. Afterwards, and until the 16th century, all the German Emperors were crowned first in Aachen and then in Rome, which highlights the attachment to Charlemagne's political legacy. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] confirmed that coronations were to take place in the palatine chapel.\n\n[[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] (955\u2013983) lived in Aachen with his wife [[Theophanu]]. In the summer of 978 [[Lothair of France]] led a raid on [[Aachen]] but the Imperial family avoided capture. Relating these events, [[Richer of Reims]] states the existence of a bronze eagle, which exact location is unknown:\n\n{{Quotation|[...] The bronze eagle, that Charlemagne had put on top of the palace in a flight attitude, has been turned back towards the East. The Germans had turned it towards the West to symbolize that their cavalry could beat the French whenever they wanted [...].<ref>Richer, ''Histoire de France (888\u2013995)'', tome 2, edition and translation by Robert Latouche, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1964, p. 89</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Aachen2.jpg|thumb|Aachen's city hall is today located on the site of the Council hall]]\n\nIn 881, a [[Viking]] raid damaged the palace and the chapel. In 1000, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] had Charlemagne's tomb opened. According to two 11th-century chroniclers, he would have been found sitting on his throne, wearing his crown and holding his [[scepter]].<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 590</ref> However, Eginhard does not mention it in his biography of the Emperor. At the same time the worship of Charlemagne began to attract [[pilgrims]] to the chapel. In the 12th century, [[Frederick Barbarossa]] placed the body of the Carolingian Emperor into a  [[reliquary]] interceded with the Pope for his  [[canonization]]; the [[relics]] were scattered across the empire. The treasure of Aachen began to grow with the numerous gifts of French and German kings and princes.\n\nBetween 1355 and 1414, an [[apse]] was added to the East of the Chapel. The city hall was built from 1267 on the location of the Council Hall. During the [[French Revolution]], the French occupied Aachen and looted the treasure. Before choosing [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] had considered for a time having his Imperial coronation take place in Aachen.<ref>J. Favier, ''Charlemagne'', 1999, p. 691</ref> The chapel was restored in 1884. In 1978, the cathedral, including the chapel, was listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aachen]]\n* [[Carolingian art]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--Do not erase, all the books are quoted in the text; alphabetical ranking-->\n* Alain Erlande-Brandeburg, Anne-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Erlande-Brandeburg, ''Histoire de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise, tome 1 : du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Renaissance, IV<sup>e</sup> \u2013 XVI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle'', 1999, Paris, \u00e9ditions du Patrimoine, {{ISBN|2-85620-367-1}}.\n* Gabrielle D\u00e9mians D\u2019Archimbaud, ''Histoire artistique de l\u2019Occident m\u00e9di\u00e9val'', Paris, Colin, 3<sup>e</sup> \u00e9dition, 1968, 1992, {{ISBN|2-200-31304-7}}.\n* Marcel Durliat, ''Des barbares \u00e0 l\u2019an Mil'', Paris, \u00e9ditions citadelles et Mazenod, 1985, {{ISBN|2-85088-020-5}}.\n* Jean Favier, ''Charlemagne'', Paris, Fayard, 1999, {{ISBN|2-213-60404-5}}.\n* Jean Hubert, Jean Porcher, W.

[hi people] It was the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] [[political machine]] that played a major role in controlling [[History of New York City|New York City]] and [[New York State]] politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. It typically controlled Democratic Party nominations and [[political patronage]] in [[Manhattan]] after the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854, and used its patronage resources to build a loyal, well-rewarded core of district and precinct leaders; after 1850 the great majority were [[Irish Catholic]]s.\n\nThe Tammany Society emerged as the center for [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics in the city in the early 19th century.  After 1854, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's rapidly expanding immigrant community, which functioned as its base of political capital. The business community appreciated its readiness, at moderate cost,  to cut through red tape and legislative mazes to facilitate rapid economic growth. The Tammany Hall [[ward boss]] or [[ward heeler]] \u2013 [[Wards of New York City|ward]]s were the city's smallest political units from 1786 to 1938 \u2013 served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.  By 1872 Tammany had an Irish Catholic \"boss,\" and in 1928 a Tammany hero, [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Al Smith]], won the Democratic presidential nomination.  However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and [[political corruption]], perhaps most infamously under [[William M. Tweed|William M. \"Boss\" Tweed]] in the mid-19th century.  By the 1880s, Tammany was building local clubs that appealed to social activists from the ethnic middle class.<ref>Peel, Roy V.

In 1932, [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]] was forced from office when his bribery was exposed. Roosevelt stripped Tammany of federal patronage.  Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]] was elected mayor on a [[Electoral fusion|Fusion]] ticket and became the first anti-Tammany mayor to be re-elected.  A brief resurgence in Tammany power in the 1950s under the leadership of [[Carmine DeSapio]] was met with Democratic Party opposition led by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Herbert Lehman]], and the New York Committee for Democratic Voters.

The society adopted many Native American words and also their customs, going so far as to call their meeting hall a [[wigwam]]. The first Grand [[Sachem]], as the leader was titled, was [[William Mooney (Tammany)|William Mooney]], an upholsterer of [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]].<ref name=\"The History of New York State\">[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch5/pt1.html The History of New York State<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024000/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch5/pt1.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> Although Mooney claimed the top role in the early organization, it was a wealthy merchant and philanthropist named [[John Pintard]] who created the society's constitution and declared its mission as \"[a] political institution founded on a strong republican basis whose democratic principles will serve in some measure to correct the aristocracy of our city.\" Pintard also established the various Native American titles of the society.<ref>Allen pp. 5-6</ref> The Society had the political backing of the [[George Clinton (vice president)|Clinton]] family in this era, whereas the [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Schuyler]] family backed the [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] [[Federalists]], and the [[Livingston Manor|Livingstons]] eventually sided with the anti-federalists and the Society.<ref>Allen p.7, 10</ref> The Society assisted the federal government in procuring a peace treaty with the Creek Indians of Georgia and Florida at the request of George Washington in 1790 and also hosted [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]] in 1793, representative of the New French Republic after the [[French Revolution]] toppled the old regime.<ref>Allen pp.7-10</ref>\n\nBy 1798, the society's activities had grown increasingly political. High ranking Democratic-Republican [[Aaron Burr]] saw Tammany Hall as an opportunity to counter [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Society of the Cincinnati]].<ref name=\"tamboo\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807536,00.html \"Sachems & Sinners: An Informal History of Tammany Hall\"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (August 22, 1955)</ref> Eventually Tammany emerged as the center of [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics in the city.<ref name=\"The History of New York State\"/> Burr used Tammany Hall as a campaign asset during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]], in which he acted as Democratic-Republican campaign manager. Some historians believe that without Tammany, President [[John Adams]] might have won New York State's electoral votes and won reelection.<ref>Parmet and Hecht, pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\t  \t\nEarly cases of political corruption involving Tammany Hall came to light during the group's feud with local politician [[Dewitt Clinton]]. The feud began in 1802 after Clinton accused Aaron Burr of being a traitor to the Democratic-Republican Party.<ref name=\":1\">Myers, p. 17</ref> Clinton's uncle, George Clinton, was jealous of Burr's achievements and positions. However, George was too old to compete with young Aaron Burr, and so he left it to his nephew to topple Burr.<ref name=\":1\" /> One of Burr's political cohorts and the author of Burr's biography was a businessman, a newspaper editor, and a sachem of the Society named Matthew L. Davis. Other Burr operatives included [[William P. Van Ness]] and John Swartwout, the latter of whom dueled with De Witt Clinton in 1802 in New Jersey.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 13,14,18\">Allen pp. 13,14,18</ref> In 1803, Clinton left the United States Senate and became Mayor of New York City.<ref name=ta21rtv>Myers, p. 21</ref> As mayor, Clinton enforced a spoils system and appointed his family and partisans to positions in the city's local government.<ref name=ta21rtv /> Tammany Hall soon realized its influence over the local political scene was no match for that of Clinton,<ref name=ta21rtv /> in part because Burr's support among New York City's residents greatly faded after he shot and killed [[Alexander Hamilton]] in a duel.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\">Myers, p. 28</ref> Tammany continued to support him for a time,<ref name=ta22rtv /> but eventually pressure from the public persuaded the organization to no longer affiliate themselves with Burr.<ref name=ta22rtv />\n\nMatthew Davis would go on to refine the Society as a political machine, beginning in 1805. The Society, with Davis's guidance, received a state charter as a charitable organization, organized the General Committee of Tammany Hall, and used the General Committee to decide leadership within the Democratic-Republican party in New York City from that point forward.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 13,14,18\"/> In December 1805, Dewitt Clinton reached out to supporters of Burr in order to gain enough support to resist the influence of the powerful Livingston family.<ref name=ta22rtv /> The Livingstons, led by former New York City mayor [[Edward Livingston]], backed New York Governor Morgan Lewis, who presented a significant challenge to Clinton.<ref name=ta23rtv>Myers, p. 23</ref> The Tammany Hall sachems agreed to meet with Clinton in secret, on February 20, 1806,<ref name=ta23rtv /> and agreed to back him, on the condition that the Clintons would once again acknowledge Aaron Burr as a Democratic-Republican and stop using \"Burrism\" as a reason to object to their ideas.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Clintons readily agreed to conditions, but did not intend to honor the conditions. When the Sachems caught wind of this, the feud between Tammany Hall and Clinton continued.<ref name=ta22rtv />\n\nTammany Hall became a locally organized machine dedicated to stopping Clinton and Federalists from rising to power in New York.<ref name=ta24rtv>Myers, p. 24</ref> However, local Democratic-Republicans began to turn against Tammany Hall.<ref name=\"ta25rtv\">Myers, p. 26</ref>  From 1806 to 1809 public opinion forced the local Common Council to crack down on Tammany Hall. The resulting investigations found that a number of Tammany officials were guilty of embezzlement and illegal activity.<ref name=ta28rtv>Myers, pp. 27\u201330</ref> For example, one official, Benjamin Romaine was found guilty of using his power to acquire land without payment and was ultimately removed from his office as City Comptroller<ref name=\"ta23rtv\" /> despite the Council being controlled by Democrat-Republicans.<ref name=\"ta23rtv\" /> Following the disclosures, the Federalists won control of the state legislature and the Democratic-Republican Party maintained a slim majority of the local government in New York City.<ref name=ta30rtv>Myers, p. 30</ref> Matthew Davis convinced other sachems to join him in a public relations stunt that provided income for the Society. The shallow graves of some Revolutionary War soldiers who died in British prison ships were located in [[Wallabout Bay]] (near the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]). Davis announced that the Society was going to provide proper burials for these soldiers with [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|a monument]] dedicated to their memory on nearby land owned by a fellow sachem. The remains were reburied. The Society led a flotilla, on April 13, 1808, in thirteen boats, to Brooklyn, with each boat carrying a symbolic coffin. A dedication ceremony was held at Wallabout Bay and the state voted to provide the Society $1,000 to build a monument. The Society pocketed the money and the monument was never built.<ref>Allen p.21</ref> However, Tammany Hall did not learn their lesson,<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" /> and instead of fixing the problem of corruption, Wortman, one of the chief powers at the time, created a committee, consisting of one member from each ward, that would investigate and report in general meetings who were friends or enemies.<ref name=\"ta25rtv\" />\n\nDuring the years between 1809-1810, the feud between Tammany Hall and the Clintonites intensified, as each party continued attacking each other.<ref name=\"ta25rtv\"/> One of the Clintonites, James Cheetham, wrote extensively about Tammany and its corrupt activities, using his position as State Printer and publishing his work in the ''American Citizen'' newspaper''.''<ref name=\":2\">Myers, p. 27</ref> Tammany Hall did not take lightly to these activities and managed to remove Cheetham from his position as State Printer.<ref name=\":2\" /> At the same time, Clinton attempted to cooperate with Tammany Hall in order to create a state dominated by Democratic-Republicans. In an attempt to persuade Tammany sachems, he pulled his support for Cheetham, who was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at the time.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" /> Cheetham's loss of Clinton's support angered him, and he responded by releasing details of Tammany and Clinton's attempts at cooperating to control the state.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" /> On September 18, 1810, James Cheetham died after an attack that was possibly Tammany-related.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" />\n\t  \t\nBetween the years 1809 and 1815, Tammany Hall slowly revived itself by accepting immigrants and by secretly building a new wigwam to hold meetings whenever new Sachems were named.<ref name=\"ta36rtv\">Myers, pp. 36\u201338</ref> The Democratic-Republican Committee, a new committee which consisted of the most influential local Democratic Republicans, would now name the new Sachems as well.<ref name=\"ta338rtv\">Myers, p. 38</ref> When Dewitt Clinton decided to run for president in 1811, Tammany Hall immediately accused Clinton of treason to his party, as well as attempting to create a family aristocracy. Even though New York State voted for Clinton the following year, republicans could not help but see Clinton's actions as being exactly what Tammany had accused them of. With this, most republicans in New York City turned away from Clinton. When Tammany Hall positioned itself to support the War of 1812 and to support the Embargo Act, many others who supported the war joined Tammany Hall.<ref name=\"ta39rtv\">Myers, p. 39</ref> In fact, during this time, because of its success in establishing political opinion, Tammany Hall was able to grow stronger and even gained support from Federalists members who supported the war.<ref name=\":3\">Myers, p. 36</ref> The Native American titles of the Society were disused during and after the War of 1812 in response to attacks from Native Americans on White Americans.<ref>Allen p. 24</ref> During this time we see Tammany Hall's earliest application of its most notable technique- turning support away from opposing parties, and rewarding newly joined members.<ref name=\":3\" /> This was the case for Federalists who joined Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall managed to gain power, as well as reduce Clinton and his followers to just a small fraction.<ref>Myers, p. 35</ref> In 1815, Tammany Hall grand sachem [[John Ferguson (New York politician)|John Ferguson]] defeated Dewitt Clinton and was elected mayor.  However, in 1817 Clinton, with his success on the Erie Canal project, gained so much popularity that despite his weak position after the War, and Tammany's immense efforts, he once again became Governor of New York and Tammany Hall, again, fell.<ref name=\":4\">Myers, p. 46</ref> Another factor leading to Clinton's popularity was his patronage of immigrants. The origins of Tammany Hall were based on representing \"pure\" or \"native\" Americans. This mean that the Hall dismissed immigrants such as the Irish and Germans, although the Germans were more politically averse. In 1817, April 24, discontent for this treatment led to a huge riot during a Tammany general committee session.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Martin Van Buren]] and his [[Albany Regency]] soon began controlling the policy of Tammany Hall. This included pushing for the state referendum that eventually granted the right to vote in New York State to all free white men in 1821. After voting rights were expanded, Tammany Hall could further increase its political power.<ref>Allen pp.27-50</ref> Tammany Hall soon began to accept Irish immigrants as members and eventually became dependent on them to maintain viability as a political force.<ref name=\"Tweedfall\" />  Until his death in 1828, Clinton would remain Governor of New York, with the exception of the two-year period of 1823\u20131824, and Tammany Hall's influence waned.\n\nDuring the [[U.S. presidential election, 1828|1828 U.S. presidential election]], Tammany Hall leaders met with Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson and agreed to endorse him after he promised to give them control over the allocation of some federal jobs.<ref name=\"jacktam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/new-york-election-results/|title=New York Election Results|work=Mahalo.com}}</ref> After he was elected president, Jackson fulfilled his promise.<ref name=jacktam />  After 1829, Tammany Hall became the city affiliate of the Democratic Party, controlling most of the New York City elections afterwards.<ref name=uoqbvoaofy /> In the 1830s the [[Loco-Focos]], an anti-monopoly and pro-labor faction of the Democratic Party, became Tammany's main rival for votes by appealing to workingmen, however, their political opponent remained the Whigs. During the 1834 New York City mayoral governor election, the first city election whereby the mayor was elected by the popular vote, both Tammany Hall and the Whig party, from their headquarters at the Masonic Hall, battled in the streets for votes and protected polling locations in their respective regions from known opposition voters.<ref>Allen pp. 42-43</ref> During the 1838 state election for governor, the rival Whig party imported voters from Philadelphia, paying $22 a head for votes in addition to paying for votes at their polling places. Tammany Hall operatives continued their practice of paying prisoners of the alms houses for votes and also paying for votes at their polling places.<ref>Allen pp. 36,48</ref> Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's ever-expanding immigrant community, which functioned as a base of political capital.\n\nThe Tammany Hall \"[[ward boss]]\" served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.<ref>New York City used the designation \"ward\" for its smallest political units from 1686\u20131938. The 1686 [[Dongan Charter]] divided the city into six wards and created a Common Council which consisted of an alderman and an assistant alderman elected from each ward. In 1821, the Common Council's authority was expanded so it would also elect the city's mayor, which had previously been appointed by the state government. In 1834, the state constitution was amended and required the city's mayor to be elected by direct popular vote. In 1834, [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence]], a pro-Tammany Democrat, would become the first mayor ever elected by popular vote in the city's history.  See [http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/state/1944-a-brief-history-of-election-law-in-new-york \"A Brief History of Election Law in New York\"] on the Gotham Gazette website</ref>  During the 1840s, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in New York City to escape the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]] and Tammany saw its power grow greatly.<ref>[http://www.racontrs.com/stories/city-hall-stories/tammany-hall-boss-tweed/ \"Tammany Hall: Boss Tweed & Thomas Nast\"] Racontours<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>\n\n[[Image:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Tammany Ring'' by [[Thomas Nast]]; \"Who stole the people's money?\" / \"'Twas him.\"]]\n\n===Immigrant support===\n\nTammany Hall's electoral base lay predominantly with New York's burgeoning immigrant constituency, which often exchanged political support for Tammany Hall's patronage. In pre-[[New Deal]] America, the extralegal services that Tammany and other urban political machines provided often served as a rudimentary [[Social welfare provision|public welfare system]]. At first, in the latter 1810s, immigrants were not allowed membership in Tammany Hall.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchId=R1&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=1&userGroupName=cuny_hunter&inPS=true&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=GVRL&contentSet=GALE%7CCX2503700502&&docId=GALE%7CCX2503700502&docType=GALE|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|publisher=}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2019}} However, after protests by Irish militants in 1817, and the invasion of several of their offices, Tammany Hall realized the potential influence Irish immigrants would have in the city. By the 1820s, Tammany Hall was accepting Irish immigrants as members of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> German immigrants were also present in large numbers in the city at this time, but did not actively seek to participate in city politics.<ref>Allen</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nHowever, Irish immigrants became even more influential during the mid 1840s to early 1850s. With the potato famine in Ireland, by 1850, more than 130,000 immigrants from Ireland lived in New York City.<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the newly arrived immigrants were in deep poverty, Tammany Hall provided them with employment, shelter, and even citizenship sometimes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tammany-hall.cfm|title=Tammany Hall|website=www2.gwu.edu|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> For example, the group gave referrals to men looking for work, and [[legal aid]] to those who needed it. Tammany Hall would also provide food and financial aid to families with sick or injured breadwinners.<ref name=\":0\" /> In an example of their involvement in the lives of citizens, in the course of one day, Tammany figure [[George Washington Plunkitt]] assisted the victims of a house fire; secured the release of six [[Drunkenness|drunks]] by speaking on their behalf to a judge; paid the rent of a poor family to prevent their eviction and gave them money for food; secured employment for four individuals; attended the funerals of two of his constituents (one Italian, the other Jewish); attended a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]]; and attended the [[Jewish wedding|wedding of a Jewish couple]] from his ward.<ref>Riordin, pp.91\u201393</ref> Tammany Hall took full advantage of the surplus in Irish immigrants to create a healthy relationship to gather more votes. By 1855, 34 percent of New York City's voter population was composed of Irish immigrants, and many Irish men came to dominate Tammany Hall. With this, Tammany Hall started its career as the powerful political machine we associate it with today.\n\nTammany Hall also served as a social integrator for immigrants by familiarizing them with American society and its political institutions and by helping them become [[Naturalization|naturalized citizens]]. One example was the naturalization process organized by [[William M. Tweed]]. Under Tweed's regime, \"naturalization committees\" were established.  These committees were made up primarily of Tammany politicians and employees, and their duties consisted of filling out paperwork, providing witnesses, and lending immigrants money for the fees required to become citizens. Judges and other city officials were bribed and otherwise compelled to go along with the workings of these committees.<ref>Connable and Silberfarb, p.154</ref>  In exchange for all these benefits, immigrants assured Tammany Hall they would vote for their candidates.<ref name=\"uoqbvoaofy\" />  By 1854, the support which Tammany Hall received from immigrants would firmly establish the organization as the leader of New York City's political scene.<ref name=\"uoqbvoaofy\" />  With the election of [[Fernando Wood]], the first person to be supported by the Tammany Hall machine,<ref name=\":0\" /> as mayor in 1854, Tammany Hall would proceed to dominate the New York City political arena until [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s mayoralty after the election of 1934.<ref name=\"uoqbvoaofy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tammany-hall.cfm|title=Tammany Hall|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves===\nAfter Fernando Wood's lost reelection run for U.S. Congress in 1842, he left politics for a while to work on his shipping business. A power vacuum of sorts existed through the 1840s for Tammany Hall, which became dominated with fights between political and basically street gangs fighting over turf. These gangs included the [[Dead Rabbits]], the [[Bowery Boys]], Mike Walsh's Spartan Association, the [[Roach Guards]], the Plug Uglies, the Wide-Awakes, and Captain [[Isaiah Rynders]]' Empire Club. Rynders was the leader of Tammany's Sixth Ward and a member of the General Committee who was also said to have been responsible for coordinating all political-related gang activity. Many of these leaders coordinated their activities from saloons, which became a target of prohibitionists and reformers.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 54-62\">Allen pp. 54-62</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 1850s, the city economy began to pick up and Tammany members would profit. The City Council of New York during these years would be known as the most corrupt up to this time. The new City Council of 1852 swept in Tammany politicians to replace the outgoing Whig ones, whom did little with their power. The new council was made up of two sets of 20 members, a twenty-member Board of Aldermen and a twenty-member Board of Assistant Aldermen. This new council would be known as the Forty Thieves. Each Alderman had the power to appoint police (including precinct officers) and license saloons within his district. Together, the Aldermen possessed the power to grant franchises for streetcar lines and ferries. Each Alderman also sat as judge in criminal courts - determining who sat for juries and choosing which cases came to trial. On paper, these Aldermen received no pay. A number of real estate deals followed with suspicious transaction amounts, including a purchase of a pauper's burial ground on [[Ward's Island]] and the sale of city property occupying [[Gansevoort Market]] near the western end of 14th Street to Reuben Lovejoy, an associate of James B. Taylor, a friend of many of the Aldermen. Other deals included expensive fireworks displays and bribes for ferry and railroad operations (Jacob Sharp for the Wall Street Ferry and various applicants for the Third Avenue railroad). Aldermen would also resort to creating strike legislation to obtain quick cash - a disingenuous bill would be introduced that would obviously financially harm someone, who would then complain to legislators. These legislators would then kill the bill in committee for a fee. As the press became aware of the Forty Thieves tactics, a reform movement instigated for a change in the city charter in June 1853 so that city work and supply contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder, franchises were awarded to the highest bidder, and that bribery was punished harshly.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 54-62\"/>\n\n===Fernando Wood era===\nFernando Wood attempted several small businesses in the city during the 1830s while simultaneously increasing his involvement with Tammany Hall. These early business attempts failed, but by 1836, at the age of 24, he became a member of the Society and became known for resolving the dispute between the Loco-Focos and the conservatives of the Hall. At the age of 28, in 1840, Tammany Hall put Wood up for a seat to U.S. Congress, which he won. After Wood's run in Congress, he became a successful businessman in real estate dealings and was elected mayor of New York City in 1854. William Tweed said of Wood, \"I never yet went to get a corner lot that I didn't find Wood had got in ahead of me.\" In his first term as mayor, Wood ensured the police force was responsive to his needs, and convinced commissioners to allow him to fire officers not performing their duties. He was then accused of only hiring Democrats to replace those fired officers. Wood defied tradition and ran for a second term as mayor in 1856, which irked some of his Tammany associates. During the campaign, his police force acted as his henchman, and Wood took a portion of their salary for his war chest ($15 to $25 for captains and a lesser amount for patrolman). On election day, he gave his policemen some time off to vote, during which time his affiliated [[Dead Rabbits]] gang protected polling places. Wood won his second term. The Republicans, who made gains upstate, in response to this concentration of power in one man, created a new state charter for New York City which included more elected (instead of appointed) city department heads and officers. The Republicans also consolidated a separate police force, the Metropolitan Police, among the police forces of Kings, Richmond, and Westchester Counties. The Republicans in the state legislature also moved the city mayoral elections to odd years, making the next election for mayor in December 1857. A power struggle followed between Wood's [[New York City Police riot|Municipal Police and the Metropolitan Police]], as well as between [[Dead Rabbits riot|the Dead Rabbits and the nativist Bowery Boys]]. Tammany Hall did not put Wood up for reelection in December 1857 in light of the [[Panic of 1857]] and a scandal involving him and his brother. Wood formed a third party, the Mozart Hall Democracy, or Mozart Hall, in response.<ref>Allen pp.52-53,63,67-76</ref>\n\n===Tweed regime===\n[[File:Tweed-Boss-LOC.jpg|thumb|215px|[[William M. Tweed]], known as \"Boss\" Tweed, ran an efficient and corrupt [[political machine]] based on [[political patronage|patronage]] and [[graft (politics)|graft]].]]\n{{main|William M. Tweed}}\n\nTammany's control over the politics of New York City tightened considerably under Tweed. In 1858, Tweed utilized the efforts of Republican reformers to rein in the Democratic city government to obtain a position on the County Board of Supervisors (which he then used as a springboard to other appointments) and to have his friends placed in various offices.  From this position of strength, he was elected \"Grand Sachem\" of Tammany, which he then used to take functional control of the city government.  With his proteges elected governor of the state and mayor of the city, Tweed was able to expand the corruption and kickbacks of his \"Ring\" into practically every aspect of city and state governance.  Although Tweed was elected to the State Senate, his true sources of power were his appointed positions to various branches of the city government. These positions gave him access to city funds and contractors, thereby controlling public works programs. This benefitted his pocketbook and those of his friends, but also provided jobs for the immigrants, especially Irish laborers, who were the electoral base of Tammany's power.<ref name=gpassim>Burrows & Wallace, p.837 and ''passim''</ref>\n\nAccording to Tweed biographer Kenneth D. Ackerman:\n\n<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>Ackerman, Kenneth D. ''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005)</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnder \"Boss\" Tweed's dominance, the city expanded into the [[Upper East Side|Upper East]] and [[Upper West Side]]s of Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge was begun, land was set aside for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], orphanages and almshouses were constructed, and social services \u2013 both directly provided by the state and indirectly funded by state appropriations to private charities \u2013 expanded to unprecedented levels.  All of this activity, of course, also brought great wealth to Tweed and his friends. It also brought them into contact and alliance with the rich elite of the city, who either fell in with the graft and corruption, or else tolerated it because of Tammany's ability to control the immigrant population, of whom the \"[[uppertens]]\" of the city were wary.\n\nJames Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Dick Connolly]]'s office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] provided city accounts to O'Brien.<ref name=\"Allen, pp. 118-125\">Allen, pp. 118-125</ref> Further, Tammany demonstrated ''inability'' to control Irish laborers in the [[Orange riot]] of 1871 that also began Tweed's downfall. Campaigns to topple Tweed by ''The New York Times'' and [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' began to gain traction in the aftermath of the riot, and disgruntled insiders began to leak the details of the extent and scope of the Tweed Ring's avarice to the newspapers. Specifically, O'Brien forwarded the city's financial accounts to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The New York Times, at that time the only Republican associated paper in the city, was then able to reinforce stories they had previously published against the ring.<ref name=\"Allen, pp. 118-125\"/> The [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]] was formed in September 1871 by prominent reformers to examine the misdeeds of the Tweed ring.\n\nTweed was arrested and tried in 1872.  He died in [[Ludlow Street Jail]], and political reformers took over the city and state governments.<ref name=gpassim />  Following Tweed's arrest, Tammany survived but was no longer controlled just by Protestants and was now dependent on leadership from bosses of Irish descent.<ref name=Tweedfall>{{cite book |last=Panayiotopoulos |first=Prodromos |title=Immigrant enterprise in Europe and the USA|page=52|year=2006|publisher=Routledge Studies in the Modern World Economy|isbn=978-0-415-35371-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tammany Tiger Hunted 1893.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' cartoon by [[Frederick Burr Opper]]: \"Lots of hunters after a very sick tiger\" (1893)]]\n\n===1870\u20131900 {{anchor|1870-1900}}===\n\nTammany did not take long to rebound from Tweed's fall. Reforms demanded a general housecleaning, and former county sheriff [[John Kelly (New York politician)|\"Honest John\" Kelly]] was selected as the new leader.  Kelly was not implicated in the Tweed scandals, and was a religious Catholic related by marriage to Archbishop [[John McCloskey]]. He cleared Tammany of Tweed's people, and tightened the Grand Sachem's control over the hierarchy.  His success at revitalizing the machine was such that in the election of 1874, the Tammany candidate, [[William H. Wickham]], unseated the unpopular reformist incumbent, [[William F. Havemeyer]], and Democrats generally won their races, delivering control of the city back to Tammany Hall.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1027</ref>\n\n====1886 mayoral election====\n\nThe mayoral election of 1886 was a seminal one for the organization.  Union activists had founded the [[Central Labor Union|United Labor Party]] (ULP), which nominated [[political economist]] [[Henry George]], the author of ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', as its standard-bearer.  George was initially hesitant about running for office, but was convinced to do so after Tammany secretly offered him a seat in Congress if he would stay out of the mayoral race.  Tammany had no expectation of George being elected, but knew that his candidacy and the new party were a direct threat to their own status as the putative champions of the working man.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1099</ref>\n\nHaving inadvertently provoked George into running, Tammany now needed to field a strong candidate against him, which required the cooperation of the Catholic Church in New York, which was the key to getting the support of middle-class Irish-American voters. [[Richard Croker]], Kelly's right-hand man, had succeeded Kelly as Grand Sachem of Tammany, and he understood that he would also need to make peace with the non-Tammany \"Swallowtail\" faction of the Democratic Party to avoid the threat that George and the ULP posed, which was the potential re-structuring of the city's politics along class lines and away from the ethnic-based politics which has been Tammany's underpinning all along.  To bring together these disparate groups, Croker nominated [[Abram Hewitt]] as the Democratic candidate for mayor.  Not only was Hewitt the leader of the Swallowtails, but he was noted philanthropist [[Peter Cooper]]'s son-in-law, and had an impeccable reputation.  To counter both George and Hewitt, the Republicans put up [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the former state assemblyman.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1103\u20131106</ref>\n\n[[File:Tammany Hall interior for the national convention 1868 crop.jpeg|thumb|350px|Tammany Hall decorated for the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]]]]\n\nIn the end, Hewitt won the election, with George out-polling Roosevelt, whose total was some 2,000 votes less than the Republicans had normally received.  Despite their second-place finish, things seemed bright for the future of the labor political movement, but the ULP was not to last, and was never able to bring about a new paradigm in the city's politics. Tammany had once again succeeded and survived.  More than that, Croker realized that he could utilize the techniques of the well-organized election campaign that ULP had run.  Because Tammany's ward-heelers controlled the saloons, the new party had used \"neighborhood meetings,  streetcorner rallies, campaign clubs, Assembly District organizations, and trade legions \u2013 an entire political counterculture\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1100</ref> to run their campaign.  Croker now took these innovations for Tammany's use, creating political clubhouses to take the place of the saloons and involving women and children by sponsoring family excursions and picnics.  The New Tammany appeared to be more respectable, and less obviously connected to saloon-keepers and gang leaders, and the clubhouses, one in every Assembly District, were also a more efficient way of providing patronage work to those who came looking for it; one simply had to join the club, and volunteer to put in the hours needed to support it.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1106\u20131108</ref>\n\nHewitt turned out to be a terrible mayor for Croker, due to his personality defects{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} and his nativist views, and in 1888 Tammany ran Croker's hand-picked choice, [[Hugh J. Grant]], who became the first New York-born Irish-American mayor. Although Hewitt ran an efficient government, Croker viewed Hewitt as being too self-righteous and did not grant Croker the patronage jobs he was expecting from a mayor. Hewitt had also offended Irish voters by deciding not to review a St. Patrick's Day parade they requested of him.<ref>Allen p.175</ref>  Grant allowed Croker free run of the city's contracts and offices, creating a vast patronage machine beyond anything Tweed had ever dreamed of, a status which continued under Grant's successor, [[Thomas Francis Gilroy]].  With such resources of money and manpower \u2013 the entire city workforce of 1,200 was essentially available to him when needed \u2013 Croker was able to neutralize the Swallowtails permanently. He also developed a new stream of income from the business community, which was provided with \"one stop shopping\": instead of bribing individual office-holders, businesses, especially the utilities, could go directly to Tammany to make their payments, which were then directed downward as necessary; such was the control Tammany had come to have over the governmental apparatus of the city.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1108\u20131109</ref>\n\nCroker mended fences with labor as well, pushing through legislation which addressed some of the inequities which had fueled the labor political movement, making Tammany once again appear to be the \"Friend of the Working Man\" \u2013 although he was careful always to maintain a pro-business climate of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and low taxes. Tammany's influence was also extended once again to the state legislature, where a similar patronage system to the city's was established after Tammany took control in 1892.  With the Republican boss, [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Platt]], adopting the same methods, the two men between them essentially controlled the state.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1109\u20131110</ref>\n\n====Fassett Committee====\nThe 1890s began with a series of what would be three political investigations into Tammany Operations, reminiscent of the early 1870s. Platt was the key organizer of most of these committees, the first of which was the [[Fassett Investigation|Fassett Committee]] of 1890. This first committee featured testimony from Croker's brother-in-law, revealing gifts of cash surrounding his hotel business. The recorded testimonies resulted in no indictments and the Democrats would not suffer in the elections of 1890 or 1892.\n\n====1894 mayoral election and the Lexow Committee====\n[[File:Rogers, W. A. (William Allen), Rogers A Cinch 1893 Cornell CUL PJM 1112 01.jpg|thumb|215px|A [[bird's-eye]]-view map of New York and Brooklyn (1893), titled \"A Cinch. Says Boss Croker to Boss McLaughlin: \"Shake!\"<br>(The boss of Tammany Hall in New York, Richard Croker, and the boss of the Brooklyn political machine, Hugh McLaughlin, reach across the East River to shake hands in cooperation).]]\n\nIn 1894, Tammany suffered a setback when, fueled by the public hearings on police corruption held by the [[Lexow Committee]] based on the evidence uncovered by the Rev. [[Charles Henry Parkhurst|Charles Parkhurst]] when he explored the city's ''[[demi monde]]'' undercover, a Committee of Seventy was organized by Council of Good Government Clubs to break the stranglehold that Tammany had on the city.  Full of some of the city's richest men \u2013 [[J.P. Morgan]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]], [[Abram Hewitt]] and [[Elihu Root]], among others \u2013 the committee supported [[William L. Strong]], a millionaire dry-goods merchant, for mayor, and forced Tammany's initial candidate, merchant [[Nathan Straus]], co-owner of [[Macy's]] and [[Abraham & Straus]], from the election by threatening to ostracize him from New York society.  Tammany then put up Hugh Grant again, despite his being publicly dirtied by the police scandals.  Backed by the Committee's money, influence and their energetic campaign, and helped by Grant's apathy, Strong won the election handily, and spent the next three years running the city on the basis of \"business principles\", pledging an efficient government and the return of morality to city life. The election was a Republican sweep statewide: [[Levi Morton]], a millionaire banker from Manhattan, won the governorship, and the party also ended up in control of the legislature.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1192\u20131194</ref> Croker was absent from the city for three years starting at the onset of the Lexow Committee, residing in his homes in Europe.\n\nStill, Tammany could not be kept down for long, and in 1898 Croker, aided by the death of [[Henry George]] \u2013 which took the wind out of the sails of the potential re-invigoration of the political labor movement \u2013 and returned from his stay in Europe, shifted the Democratic Party enough to the left to pick up labor's support, and pulled back into the fold those elements outraged by the reformers' attempt to outlaw Sunday drinking and otherwise enforce their own authoritarian moral concepts on immigrant populations with different cultural outlooks.  Tammany's candidate, [[Robert A. Van Wyck]] easily outpolled [[Seth Low]], the reform candidate backed by the Citizens Union, and Tammany was back in control.  Its supporters marched through the city's streets chanting, \"Well, well, well, Reform has gone to Hell!\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1206\u20131208</ref>\n\n[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All politics revolved around the Boss. 1899 cartoon from ''Puck''.]]\n\n====Mazet Investigation====\nA final state investigation began in 1899 at the prompting of newly elected Theodore Roosevelt. This Mazet Investigation was chaired by Republican assemblyman Robert Mazet and led by chief counsel [[Frank Moss (lawyer)|Frank Moss]], who had also participated in the Lexow Committee. The investigation reveal further detail about Croker's corporate alliances and also yielded memorable quotes from police chief [[William Stephen Devery]] and Croker. This was also the committee that began probing Croker about his holdings in ice companies.<ref>Allen pp.197-200</ref>\n\nDespite occasional defeats, Tammany was consistently able to survive and prosper. Under leaders such as [[Charles Francis Murphy]] and [[Timothy Sullivan]], it maintained control of Democratic politics in the city and the state.\n\n===20th century===\n\n==== Machine politics versus the reformers ====\n{{main|Charles Francis Murphy}}\nThe politics of the consolidated city from 1898 to 1945 revolved around conflicts between the political machines and the reformers.  In quiet times the machines had the advantage of the core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of city and borough affairs; they also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Tammany for example from the 1880s onward built a strong network of local clubs that attracted ambitious middle-class ethnics.<ref>Roy V. Peel, ''The Political Clubs of New York City'' (1935)</ref><ref>Martin Shefter, \"The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884\u20131897.\" in Joel Silbey et al. eds., ''The history of American electoral behavior'' (1978) pp: 263\u201398, esp pp 294\u201395.</ref>  In times of crisis however, especially in the severe depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s, the reformers took control of key offices, notably the mayor's office. The reformers were never unified; they operated through a complex network of independent civic reform groups, each focused its lobbying efforts on its own particular reform agenda. The membership included civic minded, well-educated middle-class men and women, usually with expert skills in a profession or business, who deeply distrusted the corruption of the machines.<ref>Richard Skolnik, \"Civic Group Progressivism In New York City,\" ''New York History'' (1970) 51#5 pp 411\u2013439.</ref> Consolidation in 1898 multiplied the power of these reform groups, so long as they could agree on a common agenda, such as consolidation itself.<ref>David C. Hammack, ''Power and Society: Greater New York at the Turn of the Century (1982) pp 308\u201313</ref>\n\nThere was no citywide machine.  Instead Democratic machines flourished in each of the boroughs, with Tammany Hall in Manhattan the most prominent. They typically had strong local organizations, known as \"political clubs\", as well as one prominent leader often called the \"boss\". [[Charles Francis Murphy|Charles Murphy]] was the highly effective but quiet boss of Tammany Hall from 1902 to 1924.<ref>J. Joseph Huthmacher,  \"Charles Evans Hughes and Charles Francis Murphy: The Metamorphosis of Progressivism.\" ''New York History' (1965): 25\u201340.

Murphy wanted to clean up Tammany's image, and he sponsored progressive era reforms benefiting the working class through his two prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Governor [[Alfred E. Smith|Al Smith]] and [[Robert F. Wagner]]. [[Edward J. Flynn|Ed Flynn]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Murphy who became the boss in the Bronx, said Murphy always advised that politicians should have nothing to do with gambling or prostitution,  and should steer clear of involvement with the police department or the school system.<ref>Terry Golway, ''Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics'' (2014)  p 186</ref>\n\nA new challenge to Tammany came from [[William Randolph Hearst]], a powerful newspaper publisher who wanted to be president. Hearst was elected to Congress with Tammany support, was defeated for mayor after a bitter contest with Tammany, and won Tammany support for his unsuccessful quest for the governorship of New York. Hearst did manage to dominate Tammany mayor [[John F. Hylan]] (1917\u201325), but he lost control when Smith and Wagner denied Hylan renomination in 1925. Hearst then moved to California.<ref>Ben Proctor, ''William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863\u20131910'' the parenthesis 1998) ch 11</ref>\n\n====Power vacuum and the Seabury Commission (1925-1932)====\nAfter Charles Francis Murphy's death in 1924, Tammany's influence on Democratic politics began its wane. Murphy's successor as the Boss in 1924 was [[George W. Olvany]]. Olvany was the first Tammany Hall boss to have received a college education.  When Tammany's [[Jimmy Walker]] became the city mayor over Hylan in 1925, things were looking bright for the hall. Olvany was not an overbearing Boss, and the familiar Tammany Hall schemes from a pre-Murphy era began. Police received protection money from shopkeepers, rackets surrounded the fish and poultry markets, as well as the docks, and licensing fees for various professions were increased with Tammany Hall middlemen reaping the benefits. This bright period of influence for Tammany Hall was to be short lived. The population of Manhattan, Tammany's stronghold, no longer represented the population of the city as other boroughs like Brooklyn and the Bronx made gains. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] election as New York State Governor in 1928 further reduced Tammany Hall's power. Although Al Smith guided Roosevelt to the governorship, Roosevelt did not request Smith's advice once there and instead, appointed Bronx Boss [[Edward J. Flynn]] as Secretary of State. The stock market crash of 1929 and the increasing press attention on organized crime during the Prohibition era also contributed to the hall's decline. Olvany resigned as the Boss in 1929, and John F. Curry was tapped to fill the role. Curry beat Eddy Ahearn for the role, Al Smith's choice and often considered to be an abler man. Although he looked the part, Curry was not considered smart enough to fill the role and proceeded to make a series of poor decisions on behalf of Tammany.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 233-250\">Allen pp. 233-250</ref>\n\nThe organized crime robbery of a city judge and leader of the Tepecano Democratic Club, Albert H. Vitale, during a dinner party on December 7, 1929, and the subsequent recovering of the stolen goods from gangsters following a few calls from Magistrate Vitale, prompted the public to request a closer look at the ties of organized crime, law enforcement and the judicial system within the city. Vitale was accused of owing $19,600 to [[Arnold Rothstein]], and was investigated by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for failing to explain how he accrued $165,000 over four years while receiving a total judicial salary of $48,000 during that same period. Vitale was removed from the bench. A further investigation by U.S. district attorney [[Charles H. Tuttle]] discovered that Brooklyn Judge Bernard Vause was paid $190,000 in return for obtaining pier leases for a shipping company, and that another city judge, George Ewald had paid Tammany Hall $10,000 for the replacement seat of Judge Vitale. FDR responded by launching three investigations between 1930 and 1932, headed by [[Samuel Seabury (judge)|Samuel Seabury]], called the [[Seabury Commission]]. Another Tammany Hall associate, state Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Force Crater]], disappeared in August 1930, after the start of the first investigation, in what would become an unsolved case. Crater was president of a Tammany Hall Club on the Upper West Side.<ref>Allen p.242</ref> During questioning, Tammany associate and New York County Sheriff Thomas M. Farley denied that gambling took place in his political clubs and could not account for the frequent presence of associates of Arnold Rothstein. Other questioning focused on the combined police, court, and bail bonding scheme surrounding the improper arrest of prostitutes and innocent women. The outcome of these investigations included the dismissal of several corrupt judges, including the city's first female judge, [[Jean H. Norris]], the resignation of Mayor Jimmy Walker, the indictment of Deputy City Clerk James J. McCormick and the arrest of State Senator John A. Hastings. Sheriff Thomas M. Farley was removed from office by Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 233-250\"/>\n\n====La Guardia in, Tammany out: 1933 to 1945====\nIn 1932, the machine suffered a dual setback when mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] was forced from office by scandal and reform-minded Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D.

The measure won on a referendum in 1936.<ref name=ihhovz /> After the new charter went into effect in 1938, the ward system which had allowed only a small number of people to serve on the City Council since 1686 ceased to exist, and the new 26-member New York City Council now had certain functions governed by the [[New York City Board of Estimate|Board of Estimate]].<ref name=\"cityqctrade\">[http://council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml New York City Council website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> La Guardia's appointees filled the board of magistrates and virtually every other long-term appointive office, and the power of Tammany Hall had now been reduced to a shadow of what it once was.<ref name=ihhovz /> LaGuardia also greatly increased the number of city jobs awarded by the civil service system: about half of city positions required job seekers to take an exam in 1933, compared to about three-quarters in 1939.<ref>Allen p. 256</ref> In 1937, LaGuardia became the first anti-Tammany \"reform\" Mayor to ever be re-elected in the city's history<ref name=ihhovz /> and was again re-elected in 1941 before retiring in 1945.<ref name=ihhovz /> His extended tenure weakened Tammany in a way that previous reform mayors had not.<ref name=\"ihhovz\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/09/21/archives/la-guardia-is-dead-city-pays-homage-to-3time-mayor-body-lying-in-st.html?searchResultPosition=2|title=La Guardia Is Dead; City Pays Homage To 3-Time Mayor|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nTammany depended for its power on government contracts, jobs, patronage, corruption, and ultimately the ability of its leaders to control nominations to the Democratic ticket and swing the popular vote. The last element weakened after 1940 with the decline of relief programs like [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] that Tammany used to gain and hold supporters. Congressman [[Christopher D.

Originally presented in an upper room of City Hall, it moved to the Merchant's Exchange when that proved to be too small. The museum was unsuccessful, and the Society severed its connections with it in 1795.<ref>Burrows & Wallace p.316</ref>\n\nThen, in 1798, the Society moved to more permanent and spacious quarters, the \"Long Room\" of \"Brom\" Martling's Tavern, at [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] and Spruce Street, near where City Hall is today. Tammany controlled the space, which it dubbed \"The Wigwam\", and let other responsible political organizations it approved of use the room for meetings. This space became commonly known as \"Tammany Hall\".<ref name=allen7 />\n\nTheir new headquarters had limitations as well as advantages, and in 1812 Tammany moved again, this time to a new five-story $55,000 building it built at the corner of Nassau and Frankfort Streets, just a few blocks away.  The new Tammany Hall had a large room that could accommodate up to 2,000 people for political and social events, and the rest of the building was run as a hotel. The Society was to remain there for 55 years.<ref>Allen, p.24</ref>\n\n===14th Street headquarters===\nBy the 1860s, Tammany under Tweed had much greater influence &ndash; and affluence, so new headquarters was deemed desirable. The cornerstone for the new Tammany headquarters was laid on July 14, 1867, at 141 [[14th Street (Manhattan)|East 14th Street]] between [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]] and [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] (the building at Nassau and Frankfort was sold to [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]] and his friends, who bought a newspaper, ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', and moved it there<ref>O'Brien, Frank Michael.

It was not just a political clubhouse:\n\n<blockquote>Tammany Hall merged politics and entertainment, already stylistically similar, in its new headquarters. ... The Tammany Society kept only one room for itself, renting the rest to entertainment impresarios: Don Bryant's Minstrels, a German theater company, classical concerts and opera. The basement \u2013 in the French mode \u2013 offered the Caf\u00e9 Ausant, where one could see [[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivant]], gymnastic exhibitions, pantomimes, and [[Punch and Judy]] shows. There was also a bar, a bazaar, a Ladies' Cafe, and an [[oyster saloon]]. All this \u2013 with the exception of Bryant's \u2013 was open from seven till midnight for a combination price of fifty cents.<ref>Burrows & Wallace p.995</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe building had an auditorium big enough to hold public meetings, and a smaller one that became [[Olympic Theatre, New York |Tony Pastor's Music Hall]], where [[vaudeville]] had its beginnings.<ref>Wurman, Richard Saul.

It was the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] [[political machine]] that played a major role in controlling [[History of New York City|New York City]] and [[New York State]] politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. It typically controlled Democratic Party nominations and [[political patronage]] in [[Manhattan]] after the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854, and used its patronage resources to build a loyal, well-rewarded core of district and precinct leaders; after 1850 the great majority were [[Irish Catholic]]s.\n\nThe Tammany Society emerged as the center for [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics in the city in the early 19th century.  After 1854, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's rapidly expanding immigrant community, which functioned as its base of political capital. The business community appreciated its readiness, at moderate cost,  to cut through red tape and legislative mazes to facilitate rapid economic growth. The Tammany Hall [[ward boss]] or [[ward heeler]] \u2013 [[Wards of New York City|ward]]s were the city's smallest political units from 1786 to 1938 \u2013 served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.  By 1872 Tammany had an Irish Catholic \"boss,\" and in 1928 a Tammany hero, [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Al Smith]], won the Democratic presidential nomination.  However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and [[political corruption]], perhaps most infamously under [[William M. Tweed|William M. \"Boss\" Tweed]] in the mid-19th century.  By the 1880s, Tammany was building local clubs that appealed to social activists from the ethnic middle class.<ref>Peel, Roy V. ''The Political Clubs of New York City'' (1935)</ref><ref>Shefter, Martin. \"The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884\u20131897.\" in [[Joel Silbey]] et al. eds., ''The history of American electoral behavior'' (1978) pp: 263\u201398, esp pp 294\u201395.</ref> In quiet times the machine had the advantage of a core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of politics and policymaking in Manhattan; it also played a major role in the state legislature in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\n[[Charles Francis Murphy|Charles Murphy]] was the quiet but highly effective boss of Tammany from 1902 to 1924.<ref>Huthmacher (1965)</ref> [[Timothy Sullivan|\"Big Tim\" Sullivan]] was the Tammany leader in the Bowery, and machine's spokesman in the state legislature.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2079533|title = Underworlds and Underdogs: Big Tim Sullivan and Metropolitan Politics in New York, 1889-1913|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 78|issue = 2|pages = 536\u2013558|last1 = Czitrom|first1 = Daniel|year = 1991|doi = 10.2307/2079533}}</ref>  In the early twentieth century Murphy and Sullivan promoted Tammany as a reformed agency dedicated to the interests of the working class. The new image deflected attacks and built up a following among the emerging ethnic middle class.  In the process [[Robert F. Wagner]] became a powerful United States Senator, and [[Al Smith]] served four terms as governor and was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1928.<ref>Slayton, Robert A. ''Empire Statesman: The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith'' (2001). ch 6\u201315.</ref><ref>Huthmacher, J. Joseph. ''Senator Robert F. Wagner and the rise of urban liberalism'' (1968) ch 1\u20134</ref>\n\nTammany Hall's influence waned from 1930 to 1945 when it engaged in a losing battle with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the state's governor (1928\u201333) and the [[President of the United States|United States president]] (1933\u201345). In 1932, [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]] was forced from office when his bribery was exposed. Roosevelt stripped Tammany of federal patronage.  Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]] was elected mayor on a [[Electoral fusion|Fusion]] ticket and became the first anti-Tammany mayor to be re-elected.  A brief resurgence in Tammany power in the 1950s under the leadership of [[Carmine DeSapio]] was met with Democratic Party opposition led by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Herbert Lehman]], and the New York Committee for Democratic Voters.  By the mid-1960s Tammany Hall ceased to exist.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Nast-Tammany crop.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Thomas Nast]] denounces Tammany as a ferocious tiger killing democracy.

The society adopted many Native American words and also their customs, going so far as to call their meeting hall a [[wigwam]]. The first Grand [[Sachem]], as the leader was titled, was [[William Mooney (Tammany)|William Mooney]], an upholsterer of [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]].<ref name=\"The History of New York State\">[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch5/pt1.html The History of New York State<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024000/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch5/pt1.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> Although Mooney claimed the top role in the early organization, it was a wealthy merchant and philanthropist named [[John Pintard]] who created the society's constitution and declared its mission as \"[a] political institution founded on a strong republican basis whose democratic principles will serve in some measure to correct the aristocracy of our city.\" Pintard also established the various Native American titles of the society.<ref>Allen pp. 5-6</ref> The Society had the political backing of the [[George Clinton (vice president)|Clinton]] family in this era, whereas the [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Schuyler]] family backed the [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] [[Federalists]], and the [[Livingston Manor|Livingstons]] eventually sided with the anti-federalists and the Society.<ref>Allen p.7, 10</ref> The Society assisted the federal government in procuring a peace treaty with the Creek Indians of Georgia and Florida at the request of George Washington in 1790 and also hosted [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]] in 1793, representative of the New French Republic after the [[French Revolution]] toppled the old regime.<ref>Allen pp.7-10</ref>\n\nBy 1798, the society's activities had grown increasingly political. High ranking Democratic-Republican [[Aaron Burr]] saw Tammany Hall as an opportunity to counter [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Society of the Cincinnati]].<ref name=\"tamboo\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807536,00.html \"Sachems & Sinners: An Informal History of Tammany Hall\"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (August 22, 1955)</ref> Eventually Tammany emerged as the center of [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics in the city.<ref name=\"The History of New York State\"/> Burr used Tammany Hall as a campaign asset during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]], in which he acted as Democratic-Republican campaign manager. Some historians believe that without Tammany, President [[John Adams]] might have won New York State's electoral votes and won reelection.<ref>Parmet and Hecht, pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\t  \t\nEarly cases of political corruption involving Tammany Hall came to light during the group's feud with local politician [[Dewitt Clinton]]. The feud began in 1802 after Clinton accused Aaron Burr of being a traitor to the Democratic-Republican Party.<ref name=\":1\">Myers, p. 17</ref> Clinton's uncle, George Clinton, was jealous of Burr's achievements and positions. However, George was too old to compete with young Aaron Burr, and so he left it to his nephew to topple Burr.<ref name=\":1\" /> One of Burr's political cohorts and the author of Burr's biography was a businessman, a newspaper editor, and a sachem of the Society named Matthew L. Davis. Other Burr operatives included [[William P. Van Ness]] and John Swartwout, the latter of whom dueled with De Witt Clinton in 1802 in New Jersey.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 13,14,18\">Allen pp. 13,14,18</ref> In 1803, Clinton left the United States Senate and became Mayor of New York City.<ref name=ta21rtv>Myers, p. 21</ref> As mayor, Clinton enforced a spoils system and appointed his family and partisans to positions in the city's local government.<ref name=ta21rtv /> Tammany Hall soon realized its influence over the local political scene was no match for that of Clinton,<ref name=ta21rtv /> in part because Burr's support among New York City's residents greatly faded after he shot and killed [[Alexander Hamilton]] in a duel.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\">Myers, p. 28</ref> Tammany continued to support him for a time,<ref name=ta22rtv /> but eventually pressure from the public persuaded the organization to no longer affiliate themselves with Burr.<ref name=ta22rtv />\n\nMatthew Davis would go on to refine the Society as a political machine, beginning in 1805. The Society, with Davis's guidance, received a state charter as a charitable organization, organized the General Committee of Tammany Hall, and used the General Committee to decide leadership within the Democratic-Republican party in New York City from that point forward.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 13,14,18\"/> In December 1805, Dewitt Clinton reached out to supporters of Burr in order to gain enough support to resist the influence of the powerful Livingston family.<ref name=ta22rtv /> The Livingstons, led by former New York City mayor [[Edward Livingston]], backed New York Governor Morgan Lewis, who presented a significant challenge to Clinton.<ref name=ta23rtv>Myers, p. 23</ref> The Tammany Hall sachems agreed to meet with Clinton in secret, on February 20, 1806,<ref name=ta23rtv /> and agreed to back him, on the condition that the Clintons would once again acknowledge Aaron Burr as a Democratic-Republican and stop using \"Burrism\" as a reason to object to their ideas.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Clintons readily agreed to conditions, but did not intend to honor the conditions. When the Sachems caught wind of this, the feud between Tammany Hall and Clinton continued.<ref name=ta22rtv />\n\nTammany Hall became a locally organized machine dedicated to stopping Clinton and Federalists from rising to power in New York.<ref name=ta24rtv>Myers, p. 24</ref> However, local Democratic-Republicans began to turn against Tammany Hall.<ref name=\"ta25rtv\">Myers, p. 26</ref>  From 1806 to 1809 public opinion forced the local Common Council to crack down on Tammany Hall. The resulting investigations found that a number of Tammany officials were guilty of embezzlement and illegal activity.<ref name=ta28rtv>Myers, pp. 27\u201330</ref> For example, one official, Benjamin Romaine was found guilty of using his power to acquire land without payment and was ultimately removed from his office as City Comptroller<ref name=\"ta23rtv\" /> despite the Council being controlled by Democrat-Republicans.<ref name=\"ta23rtv\" /> Following the disclosures, the Federalists won control of the state legislature and the Democratic-Republican Party maintained a slim majority of the local government in New York City.<ref name=ta30rtv>Myers, p. 30</ref> Matthew Davis convinced other sachems to join him in a public relations stunt that provided income for the Society. The shallow graves of some Revolutionary War soldiers who died in British prison ships were located in [[Wallabout Bay]] (near the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]). Davis announced that the Society was going to provide proper burials for these soldiers with [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|a monument]] dedicated to their memory on nearby land owned by a fellow sachem. The remains were reburied. The Society led a flotilla, on April 13, 1808, in thirteen boats, to Brooklyn, with each boat carrying a symbolic coffin. A dedication ceremony was held at Wallabout Bay and the state voted to provide the Society $1,000 to build a monument. The Society pocketed the money and the monument was never built.<ref>Allen p.21</ref> However, Tammany Hall did not learn their lesson,<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" /> and instead of fixing the problem of corruption, Wortman, one of the chief powers at the time, created a committee, consisting of one member from each ward, that would investigate and report in general meetings who were friends or enemies.<ref name=\"ta25rtv\" />\n\nDuring the years between 1809-1810, the feud between Tammany Hall and the Clintonites intensified, as each party continued attacking each other.<ref name=\"ta25rtv\"/> One of the Clintonites, James Cheetham, wrote extensively about Tammany and its corrupt activities, using his position as State Printer and publishing his work in the ''American Citizen'' newspaper''.''<ref name=\":2\">Myers, p. 27</ref> Tammany Hall did not take lightly to these activities and managed to remove Cheetham from his position as State Printer.<ref name=\":2\" /> At the same time, Clinton attempted to cooperate with Tammany Hall in order to create a state dominated by Democratic-Republicans. In an attempt to persuade Tammany sachems, he pulled his support for Cheetham, who was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at the time.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" /> Cheetham's loss of Clinton's support angered him, and he responded by releasing details of Tammany and Clinton's attempts at cooperating to control the state.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" /> On September 18, 1810, James Cheetham died after an attack that was possibly Tammany-related.<ref name=\"ta22rtv\" />\n\t  \t\nBetween the years 1809 and 1815, Tammany Hall slowly revived itself by accepting immigrants and by secretly building a new wigwam to hold meetings whenever new Sachems were named.<ref name=\"ta36rtv\">Myers, pp. 36\u201338</ref> The Democratic-Republican Committee, a new committee which consisted of the most influential local Democratic Republicans, would now name the new Sachems as well.<ref name=\"ta338rtv\">Myers, p. 38</ref> When Dewitt Clinton decided to run for president in 1811, Tammany Hall immediately accused Clinton of treason to his party, as well as attempting to create a family aristocracy. Even though New York State voted for Clinton the following year, republicans could not help but see Clinton's actions as being exactly what Tammany had accused them of. With this, most republicans in New York City turned away from Clinton. When Tammany Hall positioned itself to support the War of 1812 and to support the Embargo Act, many others who supported the war joined Tammany Hall.<ref name=\"ta39rtv\">Myers, p. 39</ref> In fact, during this time, because of its success in establishing political opinion, Tammany Hall was able to grow stronger and even gained support from Federalists members who supported the war.<ref name=\":3\">Myers, p. 36</ref> The Native American titles of the Society were disused during and after the War of 1812 in response to attacks from Native Americans on White Americans.<ref>Allen p. 24</ref> During this time we see Tammany Hall's earliest application of its most notable technique- turning support away from opposing parties, and rewarding newly joined members.<ref name=\":3\" /> This was the case for Federalists who joined Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall managed to gain power, as well as reduce Clinton and his followers to just a small fraction.<ref>Myers, p. 35</ref> In 1815, Tammany Hall grand sachem [[John Ferguson (New York politician)|John Ferguson]] defeated Dewitt Clinton and was elected mayor.  However, in 1817 Clinton, with his success on the Erie Canal project, gained so much popularity that despite his weak position after the War, and Tammany's immense efforts, he once again became Governor of New York and Tammany Hall, again, fell.<ref name=\":4\">Myers, p. 46</ref> Another factor leading to Clinton's popularity was his patronage of immigrants. The origins of Tammany Hall were based on representing \"pure\" or \"native\" Americans. This mean that the Hall dismissed immigrants such as the Irish and Germans, although the Germans were more politically averse. In 1817, April 24, discontent for this treatment led to a huge riot during a Tammany general committee session.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Martin Van Buren]] and his [[Albany Regency]] soon began controlling the policy of Tammany Hall. This included pushing for the state referendum that eventually granted the right to vote in New York State to all free white men in 1821. After voting rights were expanded, Tammany Hall could further increase its political power.<ref>Allen pp.27-50</ref> Tammany Hall soon began to accept Irish immigrants as members and eventually became dependent on them to maintain viability as a political force.<ref name=\"Tweedfall\" />  Until his death in 1828, Clinton would remain Governor of New York, with the exception of the two-year period of 1823\u20131824, and Tammany Hall's influence waned.\n\nDuring the [[U.S. presidential election, 1828|1828 U.S. presidential election]], Tammany Hall leaders met with Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson and agreed to endorse him after he promised to give them control over the allocation of some federal jobs.<ref name=\"jacktam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/new-york-election-results/|title=New York Election Results|work=Mahalo.com}}</ref> After he was elected president, Jackson fulfilled his promise.<ref name=jacktam />  After 1829, Tammany Hall became the city affiliate of the Democratic Party, controlling most of the New York City elections afterwards.<ref name=uoqbvoaofy /> In the 1830s the [[Loco-Focos]], an anti-monopoly and pro-labor faction of the Democratic Party, became Tammany's main rival for votes by appealing to workingmen, however, their political opponent remained the Whigs. During the 1834 New York City mayoral governor election, the first city election whereby the mayor was elected by the popular vote, both Tammany Hall and the Whig party, from their headquarters at the Masonic Hall, battled in the streets for votes and protected polling locations in their respective regions from known opposition voters.<ref>Allen pp. 42-43</ref> During the 1838 state election for governor, the rival Whig party imported voters from Philadelphia, paying $22 a head for votes in addition to paying for votes at their polling places. Tammany Hall operatives continued their practice of paying prisoners of the alms houses for votes and also paying for votes at their polling places.<ref>Allen pp. 36,48</ref> Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's ever-expanding immigrant community, which functioned as a base of political capital.\n\nThe Tammany Hall \"[[ward boss]]\" served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.<ref>New York City used the designation \"ward\" for its smallest political units from 1686\u20131938. The 1686 [[Dongan Charter]] divided the city into six wards and created a Common Council which consisted of an alderman and an assistant alderman elected from each ward. In 1821, the Common Council's authority was expanded so it would also elect the city's mayor, which had previously been appointed by the state government. In 1834, the state constitution was amended and required the city's mayor to be elected by direct popular vote. In 1834, [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence]], a pro-Tammany Democrat, would become the first mayor ever elected by popular vote in the city's history.  See [http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/state/1944-a-brief-history-of-election-law-in-new-york \"A Brief History of Election Law in New York\"] on the Gotham Gazette website</ref>  During the 1840s, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in New York City to escape the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]] and Tammany saw its power grow greatly.<ref>[http://www.racontrs.com/stories/city-hall-stories/tammany-hall-boss-tweed/ \"Tammany Hall: Boss Tweed & Thomas Nast\"] Racontours<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>\n\n[[Image:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Tammany Ring'' by [[Thomas Nast]]; \"Who stole the people's money?\" / \"'Twas him.\"]]\n\n===Immigrant support===\n\nTammany Hall's electoral base lay predominantly with New York's burgeoning immigrant constituency, which often exchanged political support for Tammany Hall's patronage. In pre-[[New Deal]] America, the extralegal services that Tammany and other urban political machines provided often served as a rudimentary [[Social welfare provision|public welfare system]].

With the potato famine in Ireland, by 1850, more than 130,000 immigrants from Ireland lived in New York City.<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the newly arrived immigrants were in deep poverty, Tammany Hall provided them with employment, shelter, and even citizenship sometimes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tammany-hall.cfm|title=Tammany Hall|website=www2.gwu.edu|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> For example, the group gave referrals to men looking for work, and [[legal aid]] to those who needed it. Tammany Hall would also provide food and financial aid to families with sick or injured breadwinners.<ref name=\":0\" /> In an example of their involvement in the lives of citizens, in the course of one day, Tammany figure [[George Washington Plunkitt]] assisted the victims of a house fire; secured the release of six [[Drunkenness|drunks]] by speaking on their behalf to a judge; paid the rent of a poor family to prevent their eviction and gave them money for food; secured employment for four individuals; attended the funerals of two of his constituents (one Italian, the other Jewish); attended a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]]; and attended the [[Jewish wedding|wedding of a Jewish couple]] from his ward.<ref>Riordin, pp.91\u201393</ref> Tammany Hall took full advantage of the surplus in Irish immigrants to create a healthy relationship to gather more votes. By 1855, 34 percent of New York City's voter population was composed of Irish immigrants, and many Irish men came to dominate Tammany Hall. With this, Tammany Hall started its career as the powerful political machine we associate it with today.\n\nTammany Hall also served as a social integrator for immigrants by familiarizing them with American society and its political institutions and by helping them become [[Naturalization|naturalized citizens]]. One example was the naturalization process organized by [[William M. Tweed]]. Under Tweed's regime, \"naturalization committees\" were established.  These committees were made up primarily of Tammany politicians and employees, and their duties consisted of filling out paperwork, providing witnesses, and lending immigrants money for the fees required to become citizens. Judges and other city officials were bribed and otherwise compelled to go along with the workings of these committees.<ref>Connable and Silberfarb, p.154</ref>  In exchange for all these benefits, immigrants assured Tammany Hall they would vote for their candidates.<ref name=\"uoqbvoaofy\" />  By 1854, the support which Tammany Hall received from immigrants would firmly establish the organization as the leader of New York City's political scene.<ref name=\"uoqbvoaofy\" />  With the election of [[Fernando Wood]], the first person to be supported by the Tammany Hall machine,<ref name=\":0\" /> as mayor in 1854, Tammany Hall would proceed to dominate the New York City political arena until [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s mayoralty after the election of 1934.<ref name=\"uoqbvoaofy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tammany-hall.cfm|title=Tammany Hall|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves===\nAfter Fernando Wood's lost reelection run for U.S. Congress in 1842, he left politics for a while to work on his shipping business. A power vacuum of sorts existed through the 1840s for Tammany Hall, which became dominated with fights between political and basically street gangs fighting over turf. These gangs included the [[Dead Rabbits]], the [[Bowery Boys]], Mike Walsh's Spartan Association, the [[Roach Guards]], the Plug Uglies, the Wide-Awakes, and Captain [[Isaiah Rynders]]' Empire Club. Rynders was the leader of Tammany's Sixth Ward and a member of the General Committee who was also said to have been responsible for coordinating all political-related gang activity. Many of these leaders coordinated their activities from saloons, which became a target of prohibitionists and reformers.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 54-62\">Allen pp. 54-62</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 1850s, the city economy began to pick up and Tammany members would profit. The City Council of New York during these years would be known as the most corrupt up to this time. The new City Council of 1852 swept in Tammany politicians to replace the outgoing Whig ones, whom did little with their power. The new council was made up of two sets of 20 members, a twenty-member Board of Aldermen and a twenty-member Board of Assistant Aldermen. This new council would be known as the Forty Thieves. Each Alderman had the power to appoint police (including precinct officers) and license saloons within his district. Together, the Aldermen possessed the power to grant franchises for streetcar lines and ferries. Each Alderman also sat as judge in criminal courts - determining who sat for juries and choosing which cases came to trial. On paper, these Aldermen received no pay. A number of real estate deals followed with suspicious transaction amounts, including a purchase of a pauper's burial ground on [[Ward's Island]] and the sale of city property occupying [[Gansevoort Market]] near the western end of 14th Street to Reuben Lovejoy, an associate of James B. Taylor, a friend of many of the Aldermen. Other deals included expensive fireworks displays and bribes for ferry and railroad operations (Jacob Sharp for the Wall Street Ferry and various applicants for the Third Avenue railroad). Aldermen would also resort to creating strike legislation to obtain quick cash - a disingenuous bill would be introduced that would obviously financially harm someone, who would then complain to legislators. These legislators would then kill the bill in committee for a fee. As the press became aware of the Forty Thieves tactics, a reform movement instigated for a change in the city charter in June 1853 so that city work and supply contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder, franchises were awarded to the highest bidder, and that bribery was punished harshly.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 54-62\"/>\n\n===Fernando Wood era===\nFernando Wood attempted several small businesses in the city during the 1830s while simultaneously increasing his involvement with Tammany Hall. These early business attempts failed, but by 1836, at the age of 24, he became a member of the Society and became known for resolving the dispute between the Loco-Focos and the conservatives of the Hall. At the age of 28, in 1840, Tammany Hall put Wood up for a seat to U.S. Congress, which he won. After Wood's run in Congress, he became a successful businessman in real estate dealings and was elected mayor of New York City in 1854. William Tweed said of Wood, \"I never yet went to get a corner lot that I didn't find Wood had got in ahead of me.\" In his first term as mayor, Wood ensured the police force was responsive to his needs, and convinced commissioners to allow him to fire officers not performing their duties. He was then accused of only hiring Democrats to replace those fired officers. Wood defied tradition and ran for a second term as mayor in 1856, which irked some of his Tammany associates. During the campaign, his police force acted as his henchman, and Wood took a portion of their salary for his war chest ($15 to $25 for captains and a lesser amount for patrolman). On election day, he gave his policemen some time off to vote, during which time his affiliated [[Dead Rabbits]] gang protected polling places. Wood won his second term. The Republicans, who made gains upstate, in response to this concentration of power in one man, created a new state charter for New York City which included more elected (instead of appointed) city department heads and officers. The Republicans also consolidated a separate police force, the Metropolitan Police, among the police forces of Kings, Richmond, and Westchester Counties. The Republicans in the state legislature also moved the city mayoral elections to odd years, making the next election for mayor in December 1857. A power struggle followed between Wood's [[New York City Police riot|Municipal Police and the Metropolitan Police]], as well as between [[Dead Rabbits riot|the Dead Rabbits and the nativist Bowery Boys]]. Tammany Hall did not put Wood up for reelection in December 1857 in light of the [[Panic of 1857]] and a scandal involving him and his brother. Wood formed a third party, the Mozart Hall Democracy, or Mozart Hall, in response.<ref>Allen pp.52-53,63,67-76</ref>\n\n===Tweed regime===\n[[File:Tweed-Boss-LOC.jpg|thumb|215px|[[William M. Tweed]], known as \"Boss\" Tweed, ran an efficient and corrupt [[political machine]] based on [[political patronage|patronage]] and [[graft (politics)|graft]].]]\n{{main|William M. Tweed}}\n\nTammany's control over the politics of New York City tightened considerably under Tweed. In 1858, Tweed utilized the efforts of Republican reformers to rein in the Democratic city government to obtain a position on the County Board of Supervisors (which he then used as a springboard to other appointments) and to have his friends placed in various offices.  From this position of strength, he was elected \"Grand Sachem\" of Tammany, which he then used to take functional control of the city government.  With his proteges elected governor of the state and mayor of the city, Tweed was able to expand the corruption and kickbacks of his \"Ring\" into practically every aspect of city and state governance.  Although Tweed was elected to the State Senate, his true sources of power were his appointed positions to various branches of the city government. These positions gave him access to city funds and contractors, thereby controlling public works programs. This benefitted his pocketbook and those of his friends, but also provided jobs for the immigrants, especially Irish laborers, who were the electoral base of Tammany's power.<ref name=gpassim>Burrows & Wallace, p.837 and ''passim''</ref>\n\nAccording to Tweed biographer Kenneth D. Ackerman:\n\n<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>Ackerman, Kenneth D. ''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005)</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnder \"Boss\" Tweed's dominance, the city expanded into the [[Upper East Side|Upper East]] and [[Upper West Side]]s of Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge was begun, land was set aside for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], orphanages and almshouses were constructed, and social services \u2013 both directly provided by the state and indirectly funded by state appropriations to private charities \u2013 expanded to unprecedented levels.  All of this activity, of course, also brought great wealth to Tweed and his friends. It also brought them into contact and alliance with the rich elite of the city, who either fell in with the graft and corruption, or else tolerated it because of Tammany's ability to control the immigrant population, of whom the \"[[uppertens]]\" of the city were wary.\n\nJames Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Dick Connolly]]'s office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] provided city accounts to O'Brien.<ref name=\"Allen, pp. 118-125\">Allen, pp. 118-125</ref> Further, Tammany demonstrated ''inability'' to control Irish laborers in the [[Orange riot]] of 1871 that also began Tweed's downfall. Campaigns to topple Tweed by ''The New York Times'' and [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' began to gain traction in the aftermath of the riot, and disgruntled insiders began to leak the details of the extent and scope of the Tweed Ring's avarice to the newspapers. Specifically, O'Brien forwarded the city's financial accounts to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The New York Times, at that time the only Republican associated paper in the city, was then able to reinforce stories they had previously published against the ring.<ref name=\"Allen, pp. 118-125\"/> The [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]] was formed in September 1871 by prominent reformers to examine the misdeeds of the Tweed ring.\n\nTweed was arrested and tried in 1872.  He died in [[Ludlow Street Jail]], and political reformers took over the city and state governments.<ref name=gpassim />  Following Tweed's arrest, Tammany survived but was no longer controlled just by Protestants and was now dependent on leadership from bosses of Irish descent.<ref name=Tweedfall>{{cite book |last=Panayiotopoulos |first=Prodromos |title=Immigrant enterprise in Europe and the USA|page=52|year=2006|publisher=Routledge Studies in the Modern World Economy|isbn=978-0-415-35371-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tammany Tiger Hunted 1893.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' cartoon by [[Frederick Burr Opper]]: \"Lots of hunters after a very sick tiger\" (1893)]]\n\n===1870\u20131900 {{anchor|1870-1900}}===\n\nTammany did not take long to rebound from Tweed's fall. Reforms demanded a general housecleaning, and former county sheriff [[John Kelly (New York politician)|\"Honest John\" Kelly]] was selected as the new leader.  Kelly was not implicated in the Tweed scandals, and was a religious Catholic related by marriage to Archbishop [[John McCloskey]]. He cleared Tammany of Tweed's people, and tightened the Grand Sachem's control over the hierarchy.  His success at revitalizing the machine was such that in the election of 1874, the Tammany candidate, [[William H. Wickham]], unseated the unpopular reformist incumbent, [[William F. Havemeyer]], and Democrats generally won their races, delivering control of the city back to Tammany Hall.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1027</ref>\n\n====1886 mayoral election====\n\nThe mayoral election of 1886 was a seminal one for the organization.  Union activists had founded the [[Central Labor Union|United Labor Party]] (ULP), which nominated [[political economist]] [[Henry George]], the author of ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', as its standard-bearer.  George was initially hesitant about running for office, but was convinced to do so after Tammany secretly offered him a seat in Congress if he would stay out of the mayoral race.  Tammany had no expectation of George being elected, but knew that his candidacy and the new party were a direct threat to their own status as the putative champions of the working man.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1099</ref>\n\nHaving inadvertently provoked George into running, Tammany now needed to field a strong candidate against him, which required the cooperation of the Catholic Church in New York, which was the key to getting the support of middle-class Irish-American voters. [[Richard Croker]], Kelly's right-hand man, had succeeded Kelly as Grand Sachem of Tammany, and he understood that he would also need to make peace with the non-Tammany \"Swallowtail\" faction of the Democratic Party to avoid the threat that George and the ULP posed, which was the potential re-structuring of the city's politics along class lines and away from the ethnic-based politics which has been Tammany's underpinning all along.  To bring together these disparate groups, Croker nominated [[Abram Hewitt]] as the Democratic candidate for mayor.  Not only was Hewitt the leader of the Swallowtails, but he was noted philanthropist [[Peter Cooper]]'s son-in-law, and had an impeccable reputation.  To counter both George and Hewitt, the Republicans put up [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the former state assemblyman.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1103\u20131106</ref>\n\n[[File:Tammany Hall interior for the national convention 1868 crop.jpeg|thumb|350px|Tammany Hall decorated for the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]]]]\n\nIn the end, Hewitt won the election, with George out-polling Roosevelt, whose total was some 2,000 votes less than the Republicans had normally received.  Despite their second-place finish, things seemed bright for the future of the labor political movement, but the ULP was not to last, and was never able to bring about a new paradigm in the city's politics. Tammany had once again succeeded and survived.  More than that, Croker realized that he could utilize the techniques of the well-organized election campaign that ULP had run.  Because Tammany's ward-heelers controlled the saloons, the new party had used \"neighborhood meetings,  streetcorner rallies, campaign clubs, Assembly District organizations, and trade legions \u2013 an entire political counterculture\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1100</ref> to run their campaign.  Croker now took these innovations for Tammany's use, creating political clubhouses to take the place of the saloons and involving women and children by sponsoring family excursions and picnics.  The New Tammany appeared to be more respectable, and less obviously connected to saloon-keepers and gang leaders, and the clubhouses, one in every Assembly District, were also a more efficient way of providing patronage work to those who came looking for it; one simply had to join the club, and volunteer to put in the hours needed to support it.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1106\u20131108</ref>\n\nHewitt turned out to be a terrible mayor for Croker, due to his personality defects{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} and his nativist views, and in 1888 Tammany ran Croker's hand-picked choice, [[Hugh J. Grant]], who became the first New York-born Irish-American mayor. Although Hewitt ran an efficient government, Croker viewed Hewitt as being too self-righteous and did not grant Croker the patronage jobs he was expecting from a mayor. Hewitt had also offended Irish voters by deciding not to review a St. Patrick's Day parade they requested of him.<ref>Allen p.175</ref>  Grant allowed Croker free run of the city's contracts and offices, creating a vast patronage machine beyond anything Tweed had ever dreamed of, a status which continued under Grant's successor, [[Thomas Francis Gilroy]].  With such resources of money and manpower \u2013 the entire city workforce of 1,200 was essentially available to him when needed \u2013 Croker was able to neutralize the Swallowtails permanently. He also developed a new stream of income from the business community, which was provided with \"one stop shopping\": instead of bribing individual office-holders, businesses, especially the utilities, could go directly to Tammany to make their payments, which were then directed downward as necessary; such was the control Tammany had come to have over the governmental apparatus of the city.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1108\u20131109</ref>\n\nCroker mended fences with labor as well, pushing through legislation which addressed some of the inequities which had fueled the labor political movement, making Tammany once again appear to be the \"Friend of the Working Man\" \u2013 although he was careful always to maintain a pro-business climate of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and low taxes. Tammany's influence was also extended once again to the state legislature, where a similar patronage system to the city's was established after Tammany took control in 1892.  With the Republican boss, [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Platt]], adopting the same methods, the two men between them essentially controlled the state.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1109\u20131110</ref>\n\n====Fassett Committee====\nThe 1890s began with a series of what would be three political investigations into Tammany Operations, reminiscent of the early 1870s. Platt was the key organizer of most of these committees, the first of which was the [[Fassett Investigation|Fassett Committee]] of 1890. This first committee featured testimony from Croker's brother-in-law, revealing gifts of cash surrounding his hotel business. The recorded testimonies resulted in no indictments and the Democrats would not suffer in the elections of 1890 or 1892.\n\n====1894 mayoral election and the Lexow Committee====\n[[File:Rogers, W. A. (William Allen), Rogers A Cinch 1893 Cornell CUL PJM 1112 01.jpg|thumb|215px|A [[bird's-eye]]-view map of New York and Brooklyn (1893), titled \"A Cinch. Says Boss Croker to Boss McLaughlin: \"Shake!\"<br>(The boss of Tammany Hall in New York, Richard Croker, and the boss of the Brooklyn political machine, Hugh McLaughlin, reach across the East River to shake hands in cooperation).]]\n\nIn 1894, Tammany suffered a setback when, fueled by the public hearings on police corruption held by the [[Lexow Committee]] based on the evidence uncovered by the Rev. [[Charles Henry Parkhurst|Charles Parkhurst]] when he explored the city's ''[[demi monde]]'' undercover, a Committee of Seventy was organized by Council of Good Government Clubs to break the stranglehold that Tammany had on the city.  Full of some of the city's richest men \u2013 [[J.P. Morgan]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]], [[Abram Hewitt]] and [[Elihu Root]], among others \u2013 the committee supported [[William L. Strong]], a millionaire dry-goods merchant, for mayor, and forced Tammany's initial candidate, merchant [[Nathan Straus]], co-owner of [[Macy's]] and [[Abraham & Straus]], from the election by threatening to ostracize him from New York society.  Tammany then put up Hugh Grant again, despite his being publicly dirtied by the police scandals.  Backed by the Committee's money, influence and their energetic campaign, and helped by Grant's apathy, Strong won the election handily, and spent the next three years running the city on the basis of \"business principles\", pledging an efficient government and the return of morality to city life. The election was a Republican sweep statewide: [[Levi Morton]], a millionaire banker from Manhattan, won the governorship, and the party also ended up in control of the legislature.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1192\u20131194</ref> Croker was absent from the city for three years starting at the onset of the Lexow Committee, residing in his homes in Europe.\n\nStill, Tammany could not be kept down for long, and in 1898 Croker, aided by the death of [[Henry George]] \u2013 which took the wind out of the sails of the potential re-invigoration of the political labor movement \u2013 and returned from his stay in Europe, shifted the Democratic Party enough to the left to pick up labor's support, and pulled back into the fold those elements outraged by the reformers' attempt to outlaw Sunday drinking and otherwise enforce their own authoritarian moral concepts on immigrant populations with different cultural outlooks.  Tammany's candidate, [[Robert A. Van Wyck]] easily outpolled [[Seth Low]], the reform candidate backed by the Citizens Union, and Tammany was back in control.  Its supporters marched through the city's streets chanting, \"Well, well, well, Reform has gone to Hell!\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp.1206\u20131208</ref>\n\n[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All politics revolved around the Boss. 1899 cartoon from ''Puck''.]]\n\n====Mazet Investigation====\nA final state investigation began in 1899 at the prompting of newly elected Theodore Roosevelt. This Mazet Investigation was chaired by Republican assemblyman Robert Mazet and led by chief counsel [[Frank Moss (lawyer)|Frank Moss]], who had also participated in the Lexow Committee. The investigation reveal further detail about Croker's corporate alliances and also yielded memorable quotes from police chief [[William Stephen Devery]] and Croker. This was also the committee that began probing Croker about his holdings in ice companies.<ref>Allen pp.197-200</ref>\n\nDespite occasional defeats, Tammany was consistently able to survive and prosper. Under leaders such as [[Charles Francis Murphy]] and [[Timothy Sullivan]], it maintained control of Democratic politics in the city and the state.\n\n===20th century===\n\n==== Machine politics versus the reformers ====\n{{main|Charles Francis Murphy}}\nThe politics of the consolidated city from 1898 to 1945 revolved around conflicts between the political machines and the reformers.  In quiet times the machines had the advantage of the core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of city and borough affairs; they also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Tammany for example from the 1880s onward built a strong network of local clubs that attracted ambitious middle-class ethnics.<ref>Roy V. Peel, ''The Political Clubs of New York City'' (1935)</ref><ref>Martin Shefter, \"The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884\u20131897.\" in Joel Silbey et al. eds., ''The history of American electoral behavior'' (1978) pp: 263\u201398, esp pp 294\u201395.</ref>  In times of crisis however, especially in the severe depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s, the reformers took control of key offices, notably the mayor's office. The reformers were never unified; they operated through a complex network of independent civic reform groups, each focused its lobbying efforts on its own particular reform agenda. The membership included civic minded, well-educated middle-class men and women, usually with expert skills in a profession or business, who deeply distrusted the corruption of the machines.<ref>Richard Skolnik, \"Civic Group Progressivism In New York City,\" ''New York History'' (1970) 51#5 pp 411\u2013439.</ref> Consolidation in 1898 multiplied the power of these reform groups, so long as they could agree on a common agenda, such as consolidation itself.<ref>David C. Hammack, ''Power and Society: Greater New York at the Turn of the Century (1982) pp 308\u201313</ref>\n\nThere was no citywide machine.  Instead Democratic machines flourished in each of the boroughs, with Tammany Hall in Manhattan the most prominent. They typically had strong local organizations, known as \"political clubs\", as well as one prominent leader often called the \"boss\". [[Charles Francis Murphy|Charles Murphy]] was the highly effective but quiet boss of Tammany Hall from 1902 to 1924.<ref>J.

Murphy wanted to clean up Tammany's image, and he sponsored progressive era reforms benefiting the working class through his two prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Governor [[Alfred E. Smith|Al Smith]] and [[Robert F. Wagner]]. [[Edward J. Flynn|Ed Flynn]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Murphy who became the boss in the Bronx, said Murphy always advised that politicians should have nothing to do with gambling or prostitution,  and should steer clear of involvement with the police department or the school system.<ref>Terry Golway, ''Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics'' (2014)  p 186</ref>\n\nA new challenge to Tammany came from [[William Randolph Hearst]], a powerful newspaper publisher who wanted to be president. Hearst was elected to Congress with Tammany support, was defeated for mayor after a bitter contest with Tammany, and won Tammany support for his unsuccessful quest for the governorship of New York. Hearst did manage to dominate Tammany mayor [[John F. Hylan]] (1917\u201325), but he lost control when Smith and Wagner denied Hylan renomination in 1925. Hearst then moved to California.<ref>Ben Proctor, ''William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863\u20131910'' the parenthesis 1998) ch 11</ref>\n\n====Power vacuum and the Seabury Commission (1925-1932)====\nAfter Charles Francis Murphy's death in 1924, Tammany's influence on Democratic politics began its wane. Murphy's successor as the Boss in 1924 was [[George W. Olvany]]. Olvany was the first Tammany Hall boss to have received a college education.  When Tammany's [[Jimmy Walker]] became the city mayor over Hylan in 1925, things were looking bright for the hall. Olvany was not an overbearing Boss, and the familiar Tammany Hall schemes from a pre-Murphy era began. Police received protection money from shopkeepers, rackets surrounded the fish and poultry markets, as well as the docks, and licensing fees for various professions were increased with Tammany Hall middlemen reaping the benefits. This bright period of influence for Tammany Hall was to be short lived. The population of Manhattan, Tammany's stronghold, no longer represented the population of the city as other boroughs like Brooklyn and the Bronx made gains. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] election as New York State Governor in 1928 further reduced Tammany Hall's power. Although Al Smith guided Roosevelt to the governorship, Roosevelt did not request Smith's advice once there and instead, appointed Bronx Boss [[Edward J. Flynn]] as Secretary of State. The stock market crash of 1929 and the increasing press attention on organized crime during the Prohibition era also contributed to the hall's decline. Olvany resigned as the Boss in 1929, and John F. Curry was tapped to fill the role. Curry beat Eddy Ahearn for the role, Al Smith's choice and often considered to be an abler man. Although he looked the part, Curry was not considered smart enough to fill the role and proceeded to make a series of poor decisions on behalf of Tammany.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 233-250\">Allen pp. 233-250</ref>\n\nThe organized crime robbery of a city judge and leader of the Tepecano Democratic Club, Albert H. Vitale, during a dinner party on December 7, 1929, and the subsequent recovering of the stolen goods from gangsters following a few calls from Magistrate Vitale, prompted the public to request a closer look at the ties of organized crime, law enforcement and the judicial system within the city. Vitale was accused of owing $19,600 to [[Arnold Rothstein]], and was investigated by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for failing to explain how he accrued $165,000 over four years while receiving a total judicial salary of $48,000 during that same period. Vitale was removed from the bench. A further investigation by U.S. district attorney [[Charles H. Tuttle]] discovered that Brooklyn Judge Bernard Vause was paid $190,000 in return for obtaining pier leases for a shipping company, and that another city judge, George Ewald had paid Tammany Hall $10,000 for the replacement seat of Judge Vitale. FDR responded by launching three investigations between 1930 and 1932, headed by [[Samuel Seabury (judge)|Samuel Seabury]], called the [[Seabury Commission]]. Another Tammany Hall associate, state Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Force Crater]], disappeared in August 1930, after the start of the first investigation, in what would become an unsolved case. Crater was president of a Tammany Hall Club on the Upper West Side.<ref>Allen p.242</ref> During questioning, Tammany associate and New York County Sheriff Thomas M. Farley denied that gambling took place in his political clubs and could not account for the frequent presence of associates of Arnold Rothstein. Other questioning focused on the combined police, court, and bail bonding scheme surrounding the improper arrest of prostitutes and innocent women. The outcome of these investigations included the dismissal of several corrupt judges, including the city's first female judge, [[Jean H. Norris]], the resignation of Mayor Jimmy Walker, the indictment of Deputy City Clerk James J. McCormick and the arrest of State Senator John A. Hastings. Sheriff Thomas M. Farley was removed from office by Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt.<ref name=\"Allen pp. 233-250\"/>\n\n====La Guardia in, Tammany out: 1933 to 1945====\nIn 1932, the machine suffered a dual setback when mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] was forced from office by scandal and reform-minded Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D.

This notice was not widely disseminated, and many villagers gathered in the [[Bagh (garden)|Bagh]] to celebrate the important [[India|Indian]] festival of [[Baisakhi]], and peacefully protest the arrest and deportation of two national leaders, [[Satyapal]] and [[Saifuddin Kitchlew]]. Dyer and his troops entered the garden, blocking the main entrance behind them, took up position on a raised bank, and with no warning opened fire on the crowd for about ten minutes, directing their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which people were trying to flee, until the ammunition supply was almost exhausted.

Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 252-253</ref> Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 253</ref>\n\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] (garden) near the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C. Rankin of Calcutta\n*Sir [[Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad]], Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University and advocate of the Bombay High Court\n*W.F.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with [[jaundice]] and [[arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"<ref>Cyril Henry Philips, \"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962</ref> Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]] was of the same view\", they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" The report concluded that:\n\n* Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\n* The length of firing showed a grave error.\n* Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\n* Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n* There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\n\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\n\n* Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\n* Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\n* Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\n* Dyer's actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\n\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).<ref name=\"churchillspeech\">{{cite web |date=8 July 1920 | title = Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons  | author1=Winston Churchill | url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/amritsar.htm |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\n\n[[Reginald Dyer]] was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India. He died in 1927.<ref name=\"millbanksystems.com\"/>\n\n===Demonstration at Gujranwala===\nTwo days later, on 15 April, demonstrations occurred in [[Gujranwala]] protesting against the killings at Amritsar. Police and aircraft were used against the demonstrators, resulting in 12 deaths and 27 injuries. The Officer Commanding the [[Royal Air Force]] in India, [[Norman MacEwen|Brigadier General N D K MacEwen]] stated later that:\n\n<blockquote>I think we can fairly claim to have been of great use in the late riots, particularly at Gujranwala, where the crowd when looking at its nastiest was absolutely dispersed by a machine using bombs and Lewis guns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf |title=Royal Air Force Power Review |date=Spring 2008 |volume= |series=1 |accessdate=24 October 2010 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163004/http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Assassination of Michael O'Dwyer===\n{{See also|Udham Singh}}\n[[File:Sir-Michael-ODwyer.jpg|thumb|right| [[Michael O'Dwyer]] c. 1912]]\n\nOn 13 March 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, [[Udham Singh]], an Indian independence activist from Sunam who had witnessed the events in Amritsar and had himself been wounded, shot and killed [[Michael O'Dwyer]], the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, who had approved Dyer's action and was believed to have been the main planner.\n\nSome, such as the nationalist newspaper ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', made statements supporting the killing. The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L. Shirer]] wrote the next day, \"Most of the other Indians I know [other than Gandhi] will feel this is divine retribution. O'Dwyer bore a share of responsibility in the 1919 Amritsar massacre, in which Gen. Dyer shot 1,500&nbsp; Indians in cold blood. \u00a0When I was at Amritsar eleven years after [the massacre] in 1930, the bitterness still stuck in the people there.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Shirer, William L.|title=Berlin Diary|url=https://archive.org/details/berlindiaryjourn00shir|url-access=registration|publisher=Alfred A.

German radio reportedly broadcast: \"The cry of tormented people spoke with shots.\"\n\nAt a public meeting in [[Kanpur]], a spokesman had stated that \"at last an insult and humiliation of the nation had been avenged\". Similar sentiments were expressed in numerous other places across the country.<ref>Government of India, Home Department, Political File No {{sic|18/3/1|940|hide=y}}<!--sic: protect file name against datebot-->, National Archives of India, New Delhi, p40</ref> Fortnightly reports of the political situation in [[Bihar]] mentioned: \"It is true that we had no love lost for [[Sir Michael]]. The indignities he heaped upon our countrymen in Punjab have not been forgotten.\" In its 18 March 1940 issue ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]] wrote'': \"O'Dwyer's name is connected with Punjab incidents which India will never forget.\" The ''New Statesman'' observed: \"British conservativism has not discovered how to deal with Ireland after two centuries of rule. Similar comment may be made on British rule in India. Will the historians of the future have to record that it was not the [[Nazism|Nazis]] but the British ruling class which destroyed the British Empire?\" Singh had told the court at his trial:\n[[File:Massacre memorial in Amritsar.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Wide view of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial]]\n<blockquote>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to wreak vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?<ref>CRIM 1/1177, Public Record Office, London, p 64</ref></blockquote>\n\nSingh was hanged for the murder on 31 July 1940. At that time, many, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap:\n\n<blockquote>I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.</blockquote>\n\nSoon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of ''[[Martyrdom in Islam|Shaheed]]'', a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Monument and legacy==\n[[File:Jallianwala Bagh Entrance.JPG|left|thumb|Entrance to the present-day [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675316515).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque at [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque in Passageway Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675337405).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque in passageway of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] site.]]\n[[File:Bullet marks at Jallianwala Bagh.jpg|left|thumb|Bullet holes in wall at [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n[[File:Martyrs Well - Where Victims Leapt to Escape 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675387185).jpg|left|thumb|Martyrs Well at the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marked Wall.JPG\n| caption1  = Bullet marks, visible on preserved walls, at present-day Jallianwala Bagh\n| image2    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marks.JPG\n| caption2  =\n}}\n\nA trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress.

[[Rail transport in India|Railway lines]] were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under [[martial law]].

Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 252-253</ref> Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 253</ref>\n\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] (garden) near the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up.

The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L.

At that time, many, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous.
