The term \"rudiment\" in this context means not only \"basic\", but also ''fundamental''. While any level of drumming may, in some sense, be broken down by analysis into a series of component rudiments, the term \"drum rudiment\" is most closely associated with various forms of ''field drumming'', also known as ''rudimental drumming''.\n{{TOC left}}\n== Definition ==\nRudimental drumming has something of a flexible definition, even within drumming societies devoted to that form of drumming. RudimentalDrumming.com defines it as \"the study of coordination.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rudimentaldrumming.com/rudimentalarticles/rd/viewarticle/6473/what-is-rudimental-drumming|title=Rudimental Drumming|work=rudimentaldrumming.com}}</ref> The [[Percussive Arts Society]] defines it as a particular method for learning the drums\u2014beginning with rudiments, and gradually building up speed and complexity through practicing those rudiments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pas.org/learn/Rudiments.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126033619/http://www.pas.org/Learn/Rudiments.aspx |archivedate=26 November 2013  }}</ref> An analogy might be made to learning the [[piano]] by first learning [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[arpeggios]], as opposed to beginning by learning to play a full piece of music from start to finish. ''Camp Duty Update'' defines a drum rudiment as an excerpt from a military call with a definite rhythm, definite sticking, definite dynamic structure (accents), and a defined nomenclature.<ref>Hessler, Claus. ''Camp Duty Update.'' Germany: Alfred Music, 2017.</ref> ''Encyclopedia Rudimentia'' defines a rudiment as a short pattern of strokes, using John Pratt's logic that \"the rudiments of drumming are strokes,\" in reference to the basic [[Drum stroke]]s.<ref name=\"Bloom, Ryan Alexander 2019\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe origin of [[snare drum]] rudiments can be traced back to [[Swiss mercenaries]] armed with long [[polearm]]s. The use of [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] in close formation required a great deal of coordination. The sound of the [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] was used to set the [[tempo]] and communicate commands with distinct drumming patterns. These drumming patterns became the basis of the snare drum rudiments.\n\n====Swiss====\nThe first recorded instance of rudimental fife and drum refers to the Swiss military at the battle of Sempach in 1386.<ref>Brensilver, David A. \"History of the Snare Drum: Eight Centuries of Innovation & Ingenuity.\" ''Drum!.'' September 10, 2015.</ref> Initially, Swiss rudiments were very influential to the French system, which in turn was the basis for many other rudimental systems. Switzerland produced two distinct rudimental cultures, the wider ''Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel'' practiced in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]], [[Canton of Valais|Valais]], and [[Geneva]], and the Basel version or ''Basler Trommeln''.<ref name=\"robinengelman.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://robinengelman.com/2015/02/05/swiss-and-basel-drumming/|title=Swiss and Basel Drumming.|date=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Basler Trommeln rudiments, in contrast to the Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel,  are much more widely known and practiced outside of Switzerland due to [[Fritz Berger (percussionist)|Fritz Berger]]'s publications, ''Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen''<ref>Berger, Fitz R.

''M\u00e9thode baloise de tambour = Instructor for Basle-drumming''. Basel: Trommelverlag, 1964.</ref> and travels to the [[United States]] in the 1930s. His student [[Alphonse Grieder]] continued to promote Basel style drumming in North America for many years, despite having little credibility with Swiss drummers.<ref name=\"robinengelman.com\" /> The two Swiss systems differ in several ways, including that Basel drumming rudiments draw heavily from the French system while Swiss rudiments are indigenous, and that Basel drumming was notated in a set of symbols until the 20th century (Berger devised his own notation system for export that was much more legible) while Swiss rudiments were written in standard notation centuries earlier. Swiss Ordonnanz rudiments are nearly unknown outside of Switzerland, while Basel rudiments are featured (after the 1930s) in other systems around the world, such as the Scottish, American, and Hybrid. The [[Top Secret Drum Corps]] is a prominent organization from Basel Switzerland that utilizes traditional Basel rudimental drumming along with other rudimental influences.\n\n====French====\nFrench rudiments were influenced by the Swiss and then later contributed back to the specific Basel culture in a two-way exchange. [[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s ''Orchesographie'' of 1588 is commonly cited as one of the first \"rudimental\" texts, though its actual use of notation is limited.<ref>Arbeau, Thoinot. ''Orchesographie, Metode et Teorie.'' France, 1588.</ref> French professional drummers became part of the king's honor guard in the 17th and 18th centuries. The craft was improved during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The French dance known as [[Le Rigodon]] is one of the cornerstones of modern rudimental drumming.<ref name=\"pfyffersyte.ch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pfyffersyte.ch/files/repertoire/hit2005_PundT.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218200552/http://www.pfyffersyte.ch/files/repertoire/hit2005_PundT.php |archivedate=18 February 2012  }}</ref><!--work-->\n\nAt least 5 French military manuals appeared between 1870 and 1900, beginning with F\u00e9lix Carnaud's ''\u00c9cole du Tambour''<ref>Carnaud, Felix. ''Ecole du Tambour.'' Paris, 1870.</ref> from 1870 and N. Pita's ''Methode de Tambour'' from 1885,<ref>Pita, N. ''Methode de Tambour. Paris: Tilliard, 1885''</ref> followed closely and expanded upon by H. Broutin (1889), Th\u00e9ophile Dureau (1895), and E. Reveill\u00e9 (1897). Robert Tourte's ''M\u00e9thode de Tambour et Caisse Claire d'Orchestre''<ref>Tourte, Robert. ''M\u00e9thode de Tambour et Caisse Claire d'Orchestre''. Paris: Editions Salabert, 1946.</ref> was published in 1946 and combined a selection of 34 rudiments and the classic French military calls with studies of common orchestral excerpts such as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s Scheherezade and [[Maurice Ravel]]'s Bolero. The French system is complex and expansive, rivaled in scope only by the Swiss, American, and Scottish systems. Between 30 and 34 rudiments have normally been taught from the mid-20th century onward,<ref>http://luchesi.free.fr/tambour/index.htm</ref><ref>http://www.batterie-fanfare.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Programme-de-formation-instr-Cadres-BF-Mag.pdf</ref> from a historical catalog of over 70 rudiment variations.\n\n====Spanish====\nSpain used its own rudimental system, documented as far back as 1761, with {{ill|Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros|es}} publication of ''Toques de Guerra''. Composed mostly of single strokes, the system is extremely simple.<ref>Tejada. ''Toques de Guerra.'' Borges: Radio Nacional de Espana, 1937.</ref>\n\n====German====\nGerman speaking regions of Europe had developed their own unique rudimental system by the late 18th century, as evidenced by Wittwe's 1777 publication ''Kurze Anweisung zum Trommel-Spiel''<ref>Wittwe, Georg Ludwig Winters. ''Kurze Anweisung zum Trommel-Spiel.'' Berlin: 1777.</ref> The system was dominated by the right hand and featured only a few standard rudiments, such as the druckruf and doppelwirbel.<ref>Kruger. ''Pauken and Kleine Trommel Schule''. Berlin: Hinrichsen, 1951.</ref>\n\n====Dutch====\nThe military tradition of the [[Netherlands]] has a distinct rudimental system. Drummers are known to have participated in military functions from possibly as far back as 1570. Military units paid the drummers from their own commanders' budget until 1688 when the military began paying musicians directly.<ref>http://www.henkbruggeman.nl/Boeken/Garnizoen/Garn%209.pdf</ref> The rudimental term \"Tattoo,\" a term for a meeting of drum corps and a signal from the standard camp duty, derives from the Dutch \"Taptoe\" Tamboers. Manuals go back at least as far as 1809 with the publication of ''Over Het Tromslaan - Met Marschen En Andere Muziekstukken Voor Den Trom''<ref>Anon. ''Over Het Tromslaan - Met Marschen En Andere Muziekstukken Voor Den Trom''. Amsterdam, 1809.</ref> which indicates some basic rolls and a few military signals. ''Marsen en Signalen voor de Koninklijke Nederlandsche Armee'' by {{ill|Jacob Rauscher|nl}} was published in 1815 and shows about nine basic rudiments. Several manuals are known from the late 1800s and early 1900s, such as ''Voorschrift voor den seargent of korporaaltamboer'' of 1893, ''Tamboers- and Hoornblazersschool'' of 1896, and ''Tamboers- and Hoornblazersschool'' from 1901. The system was simplified and many embellishments removed in the 1930s.<ref>https://www.olsfederatie.com/sites/default/files/bundel%20tamboer%20B2.2.pdf</ref> The system was again refined following WWII in 1945 and 1946. Now, only the [[Netherlands Marine Corps|Dutch Marines]] continue the official military tradition actively, along with a few civilian groups. There are currently only about sixteen Dutch rudiments.\n\n====British====\nBritish rudimental manuals with decipherable rudiments date back as far as 1634 with the publication of Thomas Fisher's ''Warlike Directions or the Soldiers Practice'' which shows at least 4 ruff-based rudiments.<ref>Fisher, Thomas. ''Warlike Directions or the Soldiers Practice''. England, 1634.</ref>  A more thorough manual appeared in 1760, Spencer's ''The Drummer's Instructor''.<ref>Spencer. ''The Drummer's Instructor.'' London, 1760.</ref> British military drumming had already been exported to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] by the time of the [[American Revolution]] in the 1770s. The anonymously authored ''Young Drummers Assistant''<ref>Anon. ''Young Drummers Assistant.'' Longman and Broderip, ca. 1780.</ref> was published around 1780 and was an influential book on both sides of the Atlantic. The British system was further refined for the 19th century by [[Samuel Potter]] in 1817 with his book ''The Art of Beating the Drum''.<ref>Potter, Samuel.''The Art of Beating the Drum''. London: Henry Porter, 1817.</ref> In the 18th century, drummers uniforms were reverse color from the rest of their military unit, but after the War of 1812, and coincidentally during Samuel Potter's service, their uniforms were switched to the standard color scheme so as not to stand out in battle. In modern times, every [[Battalion|infantry battalion]] in the British military has a rudimental Corps of Drums except for Irish, Scottish, and Rifle Battalions which feature [[Pipe band|Pipe Bands]] and their associated style of Scottish drumming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drummerscall.co.uk/history/corps-of-drums-history/|title=Corps of Drums History \u2013 Drummers Call}}</ref>\n\n====Scottish====\nScottish Pipe bands, in their modern form, were created by the British Army around 1830.<ref>Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association Tutor Volumes 1 and 2</ref> British regiments made up of Scottish clansmen married rudimental drumming with the [[Great Highland bagpipe|Highland bagpipes]] and [[Kilt|kilts]] in order to retain their independent culture. The drum rudiments were modified from British and European sources to fit with the piping idioms that had been in place for several hundred years prior. Pipe bands, and their stylistically unique drummers, saw their first widespread use during the [[Crimean War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspba.org/html/history_army.php|title=RSPBA - The Heart of the Pipe Band World|website=www.rspba.org}}</ref> They continued to be an active part of battle until [[World War I]], after which they assumed a ceremonial role.\n\n====American====\nMany attempts at formalizing a standard list of American snare drum rudiments have been made. The first publication to formally organize American drumming was by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] at Valley Forge. He included camp duty signals in his general manual on military practices for George Washington\u2019s troops, the \u201cblue book\u201d written in 1778-79, though the drum parts were listed in prose.<ref>Steuben, Friedrich. Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States. Pennsylvania, 1779.</ref> The first America rudimental manual to have prescribed rudimental exercises in notation was ''A Revolutionary War Drummers Book'', also from 1778, which displayed 20 exercises that can be taken as rudiments as well as \"drum beatings\" such as the piece ''Valley Forg'' [sic].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://robinengelman.com/2010/06/26/examples-of-snare-drum-notation-part-1-1589-1788/|title=Examples of Snare Drum Notation, Part 1: 1589-1797.|date=26 June 2010}}</ref> This was followed by Ben Clark's manual<ref>Clark, Benjamin.

A New Useful and Complete System of Drum Beating. trans. George P. Carroll, 1974.</ref>\n\nSeveral more manuals of note were printed between 1812 and 1860, including those by Charles Robbins (1812), Rumrille and Holton (1817), Alvan Robinson (1818), Levi Lovering (1819), and George Klinehanse (1853).\n\nA number of manuals next appeared during the [[American Civil War]], including those by [[Elias Howe Company|Elias Howe]] (1861), Keach, Burditt, and Cassidy (1861), [[George G. Bruce|Bruce]] and [[Dan Emmett|Emmett]] (1862), H.C. Hart (1862), William Nevins (1864). Adjutant-General Samuel Cooper's general military manual of 1861 also contained a small section on rudimental drumming, but in a very simplified form.<ref>Cooper, Samuel. ''A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations.''Philadelphia: Charles Desilver, 1861.</ref>\n\n[[Gardiner A. Strube]] published his influential distillation of Civil War practices in 1870. Between the Civil War and the 20th century, Fifes and Drums were phased out in favor of [[Bugle|bugles]] for official signals, though military music continued to be taught and practiced for ceremonial purposes.<ref name=\"Bloom, Ryan Alexander 2019\">Bloom, Ryan Alexander. ''Encyclopedia Rudimentia''. New York: Hudson Music, 2019.</ref> [[John Philip Sousa]] produced a manual in 1886 that would later be revised several times by the U.S. Army. Walter Smith also produced a manual in 1897<ref>Smith, Walter. ''Instructions for the Trumpet and Drum.'' Boston: Carl Fischer, 1897.</ref> for the Army and Navy, though he was a bandleader in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. In 1912, just 42 years after Strube's Lessons, Harry Bower, in his book ''The Harry A. Bower System for Drums Bells Xylophone and Tympani,'' calls the military rudiments \"ancient,\" \"old fashioned,\" and \"old style beats, rolls, and flourishes,\" to be played only when emulating a military sound.<ref>Bower, Henry A. ''The Harry A. Bower System for Drums Bells Xylophone and Tympani.'' New York: Carl Fischer, 1912.</ref> The Bower book offers several competing versions of many rudiments taken from multiple competing 19th century manuals.\n\nDuring World War I, [[Vincent Frank Safranek|V.F. Safranek]] published a manual in 1916 (based on Smith's 1897 work), while [[Carl E. Gardner]] released another in 1918. [[Sanford A. Moeller|Sanford Moeller]] put a list in his 1925 book, which is one of the few books here intended for civilian drummers. The [[Moeller method]] advocated for a return to the \"ancient\" traditions of military drumming technique and rudiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockdrummingsystem.com/underground/drum-articles/history-of-moeller-method.php|title=Moeller Method &#124; History Of The Moeller Stroke And Technique|website=www.rockdrummingsystem.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Association of Rudimental Drummers]], an organization established to promote rudimental drumming that included [[George Lawrence Stone]] and [[William F. Ludwig, Sr.]], organized a list of 13 essential rudiments and second set of 13 additional rudiments to form the Standard NARD 26 in 1933. This was largely based on Strube's 25 rudiments from 1870, with a single addition, the single stroke roll.\n\nDuring World War II, the War Department used a manual from 1940, ''TM 20-250 Field Music Technical Manual'', that clearly echoes Smith and Safranek, though it lists no author. The Marine Corps had a competing manual, essentially mirroring Sousa but updated in 1942, ''Manual for Drummers, Trumpeters, and Fifers''.\n\nLater in the 20th century there were several notable variations and extensions of rudimental drumming from teachers like [[Charles Wilcoxon]], author of ''All-American Drummer''  and ''Modern Rudimental Swing Solos'', and [[Alan Dawson]], whose \"Rudimental Ritual\" was popular at [[Berklee College of Music]] in the 1970s.<ref>https://bateriaipercussiovalls.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/rudimental-ritual-by-alan-dawson.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Drum Corps International]] was founded in 1971 bringing together drum corps from around North America to compete, some of which had been in existence since the 1930s or 1940s (though many others were formed as late as the mid-1960s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dci.org/static/about-drum-corps-international|title=About Drum Corps International (DCI), Marching Music\u2019s Major League\u2122|website=www.dci.org}}</ref> From the outset, the drummers steadily expanded the rudimental vocabulary from the traditional American military and NARD repertoire to include Swiss rudiments as well as Hybrid rudiments that combined elements of multiple unrelated rudiments into new, more complex patterns.\n\nIn 1984, a [[Percussive Arts Society]] committee led by Jay Wanamaker reorganized, and reinterpreted, the NARD 26 and added another 14 to form the current 40 International Snare Drum Rudiments.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.pas.org/About/history.aspx|publisher=Percussive Arts Society|accessdate=23 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524041221/http://www.pas.org/About/history.aspx|archivedate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Present day====\nIn the 21st century there are four principal rudimental drumming cultures: Swiss [[Basler drum|Basler]] Trommeln, [[Pipe band|Scottish pipe drumming]], Anglo-American [[Fife and drum corps|ancient drumming]], and American modern drumming (or [[Drum Corps International|DCI]] hybrid drumming).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drummersbook.com/26-rudiments/|title=26 Rudiments|first=Hank|last=Eastwood|date=2 May 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Other organized rudimental cultures include the French, Dutch, German, and Swiss (non-Basel, poorly understood outside of Switzerland) systems, which are still studied on a small scale in their home countries.<ref name=\"Bloom, Ryan Alexander 2019\"/>  There is also a distinct historic Spanish rudimental culture, though this system is no longer widely used.<ref>Poulin, David.

One of the chief issues the IATD has with the PAS 40 is the \"Swiss influence,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iatdrummers.com/|title=International Association of Traditional Drummers - Home|website=iatdrummers.com}}</ref> though only 8 of the extra 14 rudiments that do not appear in the Standard 26 are foreign or not found in American military manuals prior to Strube. Of those 8 non-traditional rudiments, only about 4 are actually of Swiss origin.<ref>Berger, Fritz. ''Instructor for Basle Drumming.'' Basel: Trommel Verlag, 1964.</ref> \n\nThere is a movement in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, led by [[Claus Hessler]] and [[Percussion Creativ]],<ref>Hessler, Claus. \"Rudimental Codex Pr\u00e4sentation\". Percussion Creativ. Freiburg, Germany (2018).

The Rudimental Codex has been submitted to [[UNESCO]] as an intangible World Heritage Site.<ref>https://www.percussion-creativ.de/wissen-und-lernen/rudimental-codex</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n====Single stroke====\nA stroke performs a single percussive [[note (music)|note]]. There are [[Drum stroke|four basic single strokes]].\n\n====Double stroke====\nA double stroke consists of two single strokes played by the same hand (either '''RR''' or '''LL''').\n\n====Diddle====\nA diddle is a double stroke played at the current prevailing speed of the piece. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any diddles in that passage would consist of sixteenth notes.\n\n====Paradiddle====\nA paradiddle consists of two single strokes followed by a double stroke, i.e., '''RLRR''' or '''LRLL'''.<ref name=PAS /> When multiple paradiddles are played in succession, the first note always alternates between right and left. Therefore, a single paradiddle is often used to switch the \"lead hand\" in drumming music.\n\n====Drag====\nA drag is a double stroke played at twice the speed of the context in which it is placed. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any drags in that passage would consist of thirty-second notes. Drags can also be notated as [[grace note]]s, in which case the spacing between the notes can be interpreted by the player. On [[timpani]], drags are often played with alternating sticking<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freepercussionlessons.com/how-to-play-grace-notes-on-timpani/|title=How to Play Grace Notes on Timpani|website=freepercussionlessons.com}}</ref> ('''rlR''' or '''lrL''').<ref name=nasatir>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.keynotesmagazine.com/article.php?uid=120\n |title       = Too Many Rudiments?\n |accessdate  = 3 February 2008\n |last        = Nasatir\n |first       = Cary\n |publisher   = Conn-Selmer Keynotes\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20070422000418/http://www.keynotesmagazine.com/article.php?uid=120\n |archivedate = 22 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The exception being extremely slow tempos where the standard double stroke sticking of a drag can be applied more cleanly.<ref>Schweizer, Steven L. ''Timpani Tone and the Interpretation of Baroque and Classical Music''. USA: Oxford University Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n====Ruff====\nHistorically, the modern Drag was known as a Ruff (or Rough) if played closed and a Half Drag when played open.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloomdrums.com/rudimental-articles/|title=Rudimental Articles|date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Ruff can also refer to a single stroked set of grace notes preceding a regular note. In American playing the 3 Stroke Ruff has 2 single stroked grace notes before the primary or full note and a 4 Stroke Ruff has 3 singles before the primary note. Other rudimental systems have differing sticking methods and names for similar notation figures. The term Ruff is now antiquated and close to obsolescence in America in that the 3 Stroke Ruff and 4 Stroke Ruff are not officially listed on the NARD or PAS rudiment sheets and the term Drag has eclipsed Ruff (or Rough) for the double stroked rudiments, in both open or closed execution, according to the current PAS standard terminology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://robinengelman.com/2014/06/26/a-ruff-death-1634-2008-requiescat-in-pace/|title=A Ruff Death, (1634-2008, Requiescat in pace)|date=26 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Flam====\nA flam consists of two single strokes played by alternating hands ('''RL''' or '''LR'''). The first stroke is a quieter grace note followed by a louder primary stroke on the opposite hand. The two notes are played almost simultaneously, and are intended to sound like a single, broader note.<ref name=PAS /> The temporal distance between the grace note and the primary note can vary depending on the style and context of the piece being played.\n\n====Roll====\n[[Drum roll]]s are various techniques employed to produce a sustained, continuous sound.\n\n{{anchor|PAS International Drum Rudiments}}\n<!--\"PAS International Drum Rudiments\" redirects here-->\n\n==P.A.S. International Drum Rudiments==\nRudiments according to the [[Percussive Arts Society]].<ref name=PAS /> There may be as many as 1,000 distinct rudiments worldwide, but these 40 are the current American standards, referred to as \u201cinternational\u201d because they mix rudiments traditionally used in Anglo-American drumming with several drawn from the Swiss Basel drumming tradition.<ref>Bloom, Ryan Alexander.

The number of hybrid rudiments expanded rapidly starting in the 1990s.<ref>Beck, John H. ''Encyclopedia of Percussion.''

The same could then be done with the grace note for the flam, producing 3 more patterns. The resulting 6 patterns could then be combined in a sequential way, producing further variations until all combinations of elements are exhausted. Not all of the resulting combinations are named or officially listed as rudiments, but are useful in developing a player's skills.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drum cadence]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://nard.us.com/N.A.R.D._Rudiments_files/NARD13Essential.pdf 13 essential rudiments rundown sheet from N.A.R.D.]\n\n{{Drum beats}}\n{{Rudimental Percussion}}\n\n[[Category:Percussion performance techniques]]\n[[Category:Drum rudiments]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|musical rudiments|rudiments of music}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Practice Pad with Metronome Best Practice.jpg|thumb|Using a metronome with a practice pad is a common way to practice drum rudiments.|alt=]]\n\nIn [[percussion music]], a '''rudiment''' is one of a number of relatively small patterns which form the foundation for more extended and complex [[drum]] patterns.  The term \"rudiment\" in this context means not only \"basic\", but also ''fundamental''. While any level of drumming may, in some sense, be broken down by analysis into a series of component rudiments, the term \"drum rudiment\" is most closely associated with various forms of ''field drumming'', also known as ''rudimental drumming''.\n{{TOC left}}\n== Definition ==\nRudimental drumming has something of a flexible definition, even within drumming societies devoted to that form of drumming. RudimentalDrumming.com defines it as \"the study of coordination.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rudimentaldrumming.com/rudimentalarticles/rd/viewarticle/6473/what-is-rudimental-drumming|title=Rudimental Drumming|work=rudimentaldrumming.com}}</ref> The [[Percussive Arts Society]] defines it as a particular method for learning the drums\u2014beginning with rudiments, and gradually building up speed and complexity through practicing those rudiments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pas.org/learn/Rudiments.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126033619/http://www.pas.org/Learn/Rudiments.aspx |archivedate=26 November 2013  }}</ref> An analogy might be made to learning the [[piano]] by first learning [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[arpeggios]], as opposed to beginning by learning to play a full piece of music from start to finish. ''Camp Duty Update'' defines a drum rudiment as an excerpt from a military call with a definite rhythm, definite sticking, definite dynamic structure (accents), and a defined nomenclature.<ref>Hessler, Claus. ''Camp Duty Update.'' Germany: Alfred Music, 2017.</ref> ''Encyclopedia Rudimentia'' defines a rudiment as a short pattern of strokes, using John Pratt's logic that \"the rudiments of drumming are strokes,\" in reference to the basic [[Drum stroke]]s.<ref name=\"Bloom, Ryan Alexander 2019\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe origin of [[snare drum]] rudiments can be traced back to [[Swiss mercenaries]] armed with long [[polearm]]s. The use of [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] in close formation required a great deal of coordination. The sound of the [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] was used to set the [[tempo]] and communicate commands with distinct drumming patterns. These drumming patterns became the basis of the snare drum rudiments.\n\n====Swiss====\nThe first recorded instance of rudimental fife and drum refers to the Swiss military at the battle of Sempach in 1386.<ref>Brensilver, David A. \"History of the Snare Drum: Eight Centuries of Innovation & Ingenuity.\" ''Drum!.'' September 10, 2015.</ref> Initially, Swiss rudiments were very influential to the French system, which in turn was the basis for many other rudimental systems. Switzerland produced two distinct rudimental cultures, the wider ''Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel'' practiced in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]], [[Canton of Valais|Valais]], and [[Geneva]], and the Basel version or ''Basler Trommeln''.<ref name=\"robinengelman.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://robinengelman.com/2015/02/05/swiss-and-basel-drumming/|title=Swiss and Basel Drumming.|date=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Basler Trommeln rudiments, in contrast to the Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel,  are much more widely known and practiced outside of Switzerland due to [[Fritz Berger (percussionist)|Fritz Berger]]'s publications, ''Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen''<ref>Berger, Fitz R. ''Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen''. Basel; Trommel Verlag, 1928.</ref> and ''Instructor for Basle Drumming'',<ref>Berger, Fritz R. ''M\u00e9thode baloise de tambour = Instructor for Basle-drumming''. Basel: Trommelverlag, 1964.</ref> and travels to the [[United States]] in the 1930s. His student [[Alphonse Grieder]] continued to promote Basel style drumming in North America for many years, despite having little credibility with Swiss drummers.<ref name=\"robinengelman.com\" /> The two Swiss systems differ in several ways, including that Basel drumming rudiments draw heavily from the French system while Swiss rudiments are indigenous, and that Basel drumming was notated in a set of symbols until the 20th century (Berger devised his own notation system for export that was much more legible) while Swiss rudiments were written in standard notation centuries earlier. Swiss Ordonnanz rudiments are nearly unknown outside of Switzerland, while Basel rudiments are featured (after the 1930s) in other systems around the world, such as the Scottish, American, and Hybrid. The [[Top Secret Drum Corps]] is a prominent organization from Basel Switzerland that utilizes traditional Basel rudimental drumming along with other rudimental influences.\n\n====French====\nFrench rudiments were influenced by the Swiss and then later contributed back to the specific Basel culture in a two-way exchange. [[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s ''Orchesographie'' of 1588 is commonly cited as one of the first \"rudimental\" texts, though its actual use of notation is limited.<ref>Arbeau, Thoinot. ''Orchesographie, Metode et Teorie.'' France, 1588.</ref> French professional drummers became part of the king's honor guard in the 17th and 18th centuries. The craft was improved during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The French dance known as [[Le Rigodon]] is one of the cornerstones of modern rudimental drumming.<ref name=\"pfyffersyte.ch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pfyffersyte.ch/files/repertoire/hit2005_PundT.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218200552/http://www.pfyffersyte.ch/files/repertoire/hit2005_PundT.php |archivedate=18 February 2012  }}</ref><!--work-->\n\nAt least 5 French military manuals appeared between 1870 and 1900, beginning with F\u00e9lix Carnaud's ''\u00c9cole du Tambour''<ref>Carnaud, Felix. ''Ecole du Tambour.'' Paris, 1870.</ref> from 1870 and N. Pita's ''Methode de Tambour'' from 1885,<ref>Pita, N. ''Methode de Tambour. Paris: Tilliard, 1885''</ref> followed closely and expanded upon by H. Broutin (1889), Th\u00e9ophile Dureau (1895), and E. Reveill\u00e9 (1897). Robert Tourte's ''M\u00e9thode de Tambour et Caisse Claire d'Orchestre''<ref>Tourte, Robert. ''M\u00e9thode de Tambour et Caisse Claire d'Orchestre''. Paris: Editions Salabert, 1946.</ref> was published in 1946 and combined a selection of 34 rudiments and the classic French military calls with studies of common orchestral excerpts such as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s Scheherezade and [[Maurice Ravel]]'s Bolero. The French system is complex and expansive, rivaled in scope only by the Swiss, American, and Scottish systems. Between 30 and 34 rudiments have normally been taught from the mid-20th century onward,<ref>http://luchesi.free.fr/tambour/index.htm</ref><ref>http://www.batterie-fanfare.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Programme-de-formation-instr-Cadres-BF-Mag.pdf</ref> from a historical catalog of over 70 rudiment variations.\n\n====Spanish====\nSpain used its own rudimental system, documented as far back as 1761, with {{ill|Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros|es}} publication of ''Toques de Guerra''. Composed mostly of single strokes, the system is extremely simple.<ref>Tejada. ''Toques de Guerra.'' Borges: Radio Nacional de Espana, 1937.</ref>\n\n====German====\nGerman speaking regions of Europe had developed their own unique rudimental system by the late 18th century, as evidenced by Wittwe's 1777 publication ''Kurze Anweisung zum Trommel-Spiel''<ref>Wittwe, Georg Ludwig Winters. ''Kurze Anweisung zum Trommel-Spiel.'' Berlin: 1777.</ref> The system was dominated by the right hand and featured only a few standard rudiments, such as the druckruf and doppelwirbel.<ref>Kruger. ''Pauken and Kleine Trommel Schule''. Berlin: Hinrichsen, 1951.</ref>\n\n====Dutch====\nThe military tradition of the [[Netherlands]] has a distinct rudimental system. Drummers are known to have participated in military functions from possibly as far back as 1570. Military units paid the drummers from their own commanders' budget until 1688 when the military began paying musicians directly.<ref>http://www.henkbruggeman.nl/Boeken/Garnizoen/Garn%209.pdf</ref> The rudimental term \"Tattoo,\" a term for a meeting of drum corps and a signal from the standard camp duty, derives from the Dutch \"Taptoe\" Tamboers. Manuals go back at least as far as 1809 with the publication of ''Over Het Tromslaan - Met Marschen En Andere Muziekstukken Voor Den Trom''<ref>Anon. ''Over Het Tromslaan - Met Marschen En Andere Muziekstukken Voor Den Trom''. Amsterdam, 1809.</ref> which indicates some basic rolls and a few military signals. ''Marsen en Signalen voor de Koninklijke Nederlandsche Armee'' by {{ill|Jacob Rauscher|nl}} was published in 1815 and shows about nine basic rudiments. Several manuals are known from the late 1800s and early 1900s, such as ''Voorschrift voor den seargent of korporaaltamboer'' of 1893, ''Tamboers- and Hoornblazersschool'' of 1896, and ''Tamboers- and Hoornblazersschool'' from 1901. The system was simplified and many embellishments removed in the 1930s.<ref>https://www.olsfederatie.com/sites/default/files/bundel%20tamboer%20B2.2.pdf</ref> The system was again refined following WWII in 1945 and 1946. Now, only the [[Netherlands Marine Corps|Dutch Marines]] continue the official military tradition actively, along with a few civilian groups. There are currently only about sixteen Dutch rudiments.\n\n====British====\nBritish rudimental manuals with decipherable rudiments date back as far as 1634 with the publication of Thomas Fisher's ''Warlike Directions or the Soldiers Practice'' which shows at least 4 ruff-based rudiments.<ref>Fisher, Thomas. ''Warlike Directions or the Soldiers Practice''. England, 1634.</ref>  A more thorough manual appeared in 1760, Spencer's ''The Drummer's Instructor''.<ref>Spencer. ''The Drummer's Instructor.'' London, 1760.</ref> British military drumming had already been exported to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] by the time of the [[American Revolution]] in the 1770s. The anonymously authored ''Young Drummers Assistant''<ref>Anon. ''Young Drummers Assistant.'' Longman and Broderip, ca. 1780.</ref> was published around 1780 and was an influential book on both sides of the Atlantic. The British system was further refined for the 19th century by [[Samuel Potter]] in 1817 with his book ''The Art of Beating the Drum''.<ref>Potter, Samuel.''The Art of Beating the Drum''. London: Henry Porter, 1817.</ref> In the 18th century, drummers uniforms were reverse color from the rest of their military unit, but after the War of 1812, and coincidentally during Samuel Potter's service, their uniforms were switched to the standard color scheme so as not to stand out in battle. In modern times, every [[Battalion|infantry battalion]] in the British military has a rudimental Corps of Drums except for Irish, Scottish, and Rifle Battalions which feature [[Pipe band|Pipe Bands]] and their associated style of Scottish drumming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drummerscall.co.uk/history/corps-of-drums-history/|title=Corps of Drums History \u2013 Drummers Call}}</ref>\n\n====Scottish====\nScottish Pipe bands, in their modern form, were created by the British Army around 1830.<ref>Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association Tutor Volumes 1 and 2</ref> British regiments made up of Scottish clansmen married rudimental drumming with the [[Great Highland bagpipe|Highland bagpipes]] and [[Kilt|kilts]] in order to retain their independent culture. The drum rudiments were modified from British and European sources to fit with the piping idioms that had been in place for several hundred years prior. Pipe bands, and their stylistically unique drummers, saw their first widespread use during the [[Crimean War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspba.org/html/history_army.php|title=RSPBA - The Heart of the Pipe Band World|website=www.rspba.org}}</ref> They continued to be an active part of battle until [[World War I]], after which they assumed a ceremonial role.\n\n====American====\nMany attempts at formalizing a standard list of American snare drum rudiments have been made. The first publication to formally organize American drumming was by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] at Valley Forge. He included camp duty signals in his general manual on military practices for George Washington\u2019s troops, the \u201cblue book\u201d written in 1778-79, though the drum parts were listed in prose.<ref>Steuben, Friedrich. Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States. Pennsylvania, 1779.</ref> The first America rudimental manual to have prescribed rudimental exercises in notation was ''A Revolutionary War Drummers Book'', also from 1778, which displayed 20 exercises that can be taken as rudiments as well as \"drum beatings\" such as the piece ''Valley Forg'' [sic].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://robinengelman.com/2010/06/26/examples-of-snare-drum-notation-part-1-1589-1788/|title=Examples of Snare Drum Notation, Part 1: 1589-1797.|date=26 June 2010}}</ref> This was followed by Ben Clark's manual<ref>Clark, Benjamin.

Bruce|Bruce]] and [[Dan Emmett|Emmett]] (1862), H.C. Hart (1862), William Nevins (1864). Adjutant-General Samuel Cooper's general military manual of 1861 also contained a small section on rudimental drumming, but in a very simplified form.<ref>Cooper, Samuel. ''A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations.''Philadelphia: Charles Desilver, 1861.</ref>\n\n[[Gardiner A. Strube]] published his influential distillation of Civil War practices in 1870.

''Encyclopedia Rudimentia''. New York: Hudson Music, 2019.</ref> [[John Philip Sousa]] produced a manual in 1886 that would later be revised several times by the U.S. Army.

Bower System for Drums Bells Xylophone and Tympani,'' calls the military rudiments \"ancient,\" \"old fashioned,\" and \"old style beats, rolls, and flourishes,\" to be played only when emulating a military sound.<ref>Bower, Henry A. ''The Harry A. Bower System for Drums Bells Xylophone and Tympani.'' New York: Carl Fischer, 1912.</ref> The Bower book offers several competing versions of many rudiments taken from multiple competing 19th century manuals.\n\nDuring World War I, [[Vincent Frank Safranek|V.F. Safranek]] published a manual in 1916 (based on Smith's 1897 work), while [[Carl E. Gardner]] released another in 1918. [[Sanford A. Moeller|Sanford Moeller]] put a list in his 1925 book, which is one of the few books here intended for civilian drummers. The [[Moeller method]] advocated for a return to the \"ancient\" traditions of military drumming technique and rudiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockdrummingsystem.com/underground/drum-articles/history-of-moeller-method.php|title=Moeller Method &#124; History Of The Moeller Stroke And Technique|website=www.rockdrummingsystem.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Association of Rudimental Drummers]], an organization established to promote rudimental drumming that included [[George Lawrence Stone]] and [[William F. Ludwig, Sr.]], organized a list of 13 essential rudiments and second set of 13 additional rudiments to form the Standard NARD 26 in 1933. This was largely based on Strube's 25 rudiments from 1870, with a single addition, the single stroke roll.\n\nDuring World War II, the War Department used a manual from 1940, ''TM 20-250 Field Music Technical Manual'', that clearly echoes Smith and Safranek, though it lists no author. The Marine Corps had a competing manual, essentially mirroring Sousa but updated in 1942, ''Manual for Drummers, Trumpeters, and Fifers''.\n\nLater in the 20th century there were several notable variations and extensions of rudimental drumming from teachers like [[Charles Wilcoxon]], author of ''All-American Drummer''  and ''Modern Rudimental Swing Solos'', and [[Alan Dawson]], whose \"Rudimental Ritual\" was popular at [[Berklee College of Music]] in the 1970s.<ref>https://bateriaipercussiovalls.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/rudimental-ritual-by-alan-dawson.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Drum Corps International]] was founded in 1971 bringing together drum corps from around North America to compete, some of which had been in existence since the 1930s or 1940s (though many others were formed as late as the mid-1960s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dci.org/static/about-drum-corps-international|title=About Drum Corps International (DCI), Marching Music\u2019s Major League\u2122|website=www.dci.org}}</ref> From the outset, the drummers steadily expanded the rudimental vocabulary from the traditional American military and NARD repertoire to include Swiss rudiments as well as Hybrid rudiments that combined elements of multiple unrelated rudiments into new, more complex patterns.\n\nIn 1984, a [[Percussive Arts Society]] committee led by Jay Wanamaker reorganized, and reinterpreted, the NARD 26 and added another 14 to form the current 40 International Snare Drum Rudiments.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.pas.org/About/history.aspx|publisher=Percussive Arts Society|accessdate=23 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524041221/http://www.pas.org/About/history.aspx|archivedate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Present day====\nIn the 21st century there are four principal rudimental drumming cultures: Swiss [[Basler drum|Basler]] Trommeln, [[Pipe band|Scottish pipe drumming]], Anglo-American [[Fife and drum corps|ancient drumming]], and American modern drumming (or [[Drum Corps International|DCI]] hybrid drumming).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drummersbook.com/26-rudiments/|title=26 Rudiments|first=Hank|last=Eastwood|date=2 May 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Other organized rudimental cultures include the French, Dutch, German, and Swiss (non-Basel, poorly understood outside of Switzerland) systems, which are still studied on a small scale in their home countries.<ref name=\"Bloom, Ryan Alexander 2019\"/>  There is also a distinct historic Spanish rudimental culture, though this system is no longer widely used.<ref>Poulin, David.

The Rudimental Codex has been submitted to [[UNESCO]] as an intangible World Heritage Site.<ref>https://www.percussion-creativ.de/wissen-und-lernen/rudimental-codex</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n====Single stroke====\nA stroke performs a single percussive [[note (music)|note]]. There are [[Drum stroke|four basic single strokes]].\n\n====Double stroke====\nA double stroke consists of two single strokes played by the same hand (either '''RR''' or '''LL''').\n\n====Diddle====\nA diddle is a double stroke played at the current prevailing speed of the piece. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any diddles in that passage would consist of sixteenth notes.\n\n====Paradiddle====\nA paradiddle consists of two single strokes followed by a double stroke, i.e., '''RLRR''' or '''LRLL'''.<ref name=PAS /> When multiple paradiddles are played in succession, the first note always alternates between right and left. Therefore, a single paradiddle is often used to switch the \"lead hand\" in drumming music.\n\n====Drag====\nA drag is a double stroke played at twice the speed of the context in which it is placed. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any drags in that passage would consist of thirty-second notes. Drags can also be notated as [[grace note]]s, in which case the spacing between the notes can be interpreted by the player. On [[timpani]], drags are often played with alternating sticking<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freepercussionlessons.com/how-to-play-grace-notes-on-timpani/|title=How to Play Grace Notes on Timpani|website=freepercussionlessons.com}}</ref> ('''rlR''' or '''lrL''').<ref name=nasatir>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.keynotesmagazine.com/article.php?uid=120\n |title       = Too Many Rudiments?\n |accessdate  = 3 February 2008\n |last        = Nasatir\n |first       = Cary\n |publisher   = Conn-Selmer Keynotes\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20070422000418/http://www.keynotesmagazine.com/article.php?uid=120\n |archivedate = 22 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The exception being extremely slow tempos where the standard double stroke sticking of a drag can be applied more cleanly.<ref>Schweizer, Steven L. ''Timpani Tone and the Interpretation of Baroque and Classical Music''. USA: Oxford University Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n====Ruff====\nHistorically, the modern Drag was known as a Ruff (or Rough) if played closed and a Half Drag when played open.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloomdrums.com/rudimental-articles/|title=Rudimental Articles|date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Ruff can also refer to a single stroked set of grace notes preceding a regular note. In American playing the 3 Stroke Ruff has 2 single stroked grace notes before the primary or full note and a 4 Stroke Ruff has 3 singles before the primary note. Other rudimental systems have differing sticking methods and names for similar notation figures. The term Ruff is now antiquated and close to obsolescence in America in that the 3 Stroke Ruff and 4 Stroke Ruff are not officially listed on the NARD or PAS rudiment sheets and the term Drag has eclipsed Ruff (or Rough) for the double stroked rudiments, in both open or closed execution, according to the current PAS standard terminology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://robinengelman.com/2014/06/26/a-ruff-death-1634-2008-requiescat-in-pace/|title=A Ruff Death, (1634-2008, Requiescat in pace)|date=26 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Flam====\nA flam consists of two single strokes played by alternating hands ('''RL''' or '''LR'''). The first stroke is a quieter grace note followed by a louder primary stroke on the opposite hand. The two notes are played almost simultaneously, and are intended to sound like a single, broader note.<ref name=PAS /> The temporal distance between the grace note and the primary note can vary depending on the style and context of the piece being played.\n\n====Roll====\n[[Drum roll]]s are various techniques employed to produce a sustained, continuous sound.\n\n{{anchor|PAS International Drum Rudiments}}\n<!--\"PAS International Drum Rudiments\" redirects here-->\n\n==P.A.S. International Drum Rudiments==\nRudiments according to the [[Percussive Arts Society]].<ref name=PAS /> There may be as many as 1,000 distinct rudiments worldwide, but these 40 are the current American standards, referred to as \u201cinternational\u201d because they mix rudiments traditionally used in Anglo-American drumming with several drawn from the Swiss Basel drumming tradition.<ref>Bloom, Ryan Alexander.

In all, more than {{convert|160|e6acre|e3km2 e3sqmi|abbr=unit}} of public land, or nearly 10&nbsp;percent of the total area of the United States, was given away free to 1.6&nbsp;million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nAn extension of the [[homestead principle]] in law, the Homestead Acts were an expression of the [[Free Soil]] policy of Northerners who wanted individual farmers to own and operate their own farms, as opposed to Southern slave-owners who wanted to buy up large tracts of land and use slave labor, thereby shutting out free white farmers.\n\nThe first of the acts, the Homestead Act of 1862, opened up millions of acres. Any adult who had never taken up arms against the [[Federal government of the United States]] could apply. Women and immigrants who had applied for citizenship were eligible. The 1866 Act explicitly included black Americans and encouraged them to participate, but rampant discrimination, systemic barriers and bureaucratic inertia slowed black gains. Historian Michael Lanza argues that while the 1866 law pack was not as beneficial as it might have been, it was part of the reason that by 1900 one fourth of all Southern black farmers owned their own farms.<ref>{{cite book | author1=Melvin L.

The [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866]] sought to address land ownership inequalities in the south during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. The [[Timber Culture Act]] of 1873 granted land to a claimant who was required to plant trees\u2014the tract could be added to an existing homestead claim and had no residency requirement.\n\nThe [[Kinkaid Act|Kinkaid Amendment]] of 1904 granted a full section\u2014{{convert|640|acres}}\u2014to new homesteaders settling in western Nebraska. An amendment to the Homestead Act of 1862, the Enlarged Homestead Act, was passed in 1909 and doubled the allotted acreage from {{convert|160|to|320|acres}} in marginal areas. Another amended act, the national Stock-Raising Homestead Act, was passed in 1916 and granted {{convert|640|acres}} for ranching purposes.\n\n==Background==\nLand-grant laws similar to the Homestead Acts had been proposed by northern [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]]s before the Civil War, but had been repeatedly blocked in Congress by southern [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]s who wanted western lands open for purchase by slave-owners. The [[Homestead Act of 1860]] did pass in Congress, but it was vetoed by President [[James Buchanan]], a Democrat.  After the Southern states seceded from the Union in 1861 (and their representatives had left Congress), the bill passed and was signed into law by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] (May 20, 1862).<ref name=\"nps homestead\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/home/faqs.htm |title=Homestead National Monument: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> [[Daniel Freeman (homesteader)|Daniel Freeman]] became the first person to file a claim under the new act.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1934, the federal government granted 1.6 million homesteads and distributed {{convert|270000000|acre|mi2}} of federal land for private ownership.

The Free Soil Party of 1848\u201352, and the new Republican Party after 1854, demanded that the new lands opening up in the west be made available to independent farmers, rather than wealthy planters who would develop it with the use of slaves forcing the yeomen farmers onto [[marginal land]]s.<ref>[[Eric Foner]]; ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War''; 1970.</ref> Southern Democrats had continually fought (and defeated) previous homestead law proposals, as they feared free land would attract [[Europe]]an immigrants and poor Southern whites to the west.<ref>Charles C.

The law (and those following it) required a three-step procedure: file an application, [[Land improvement|improve]] the land, and file for the patent (deed). Any citizen who had never taken up arms against the U.S. government (including [[Freedman|freed slaves]] after the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth amendment]]) and was at least 21 years old or the [[head of a household]], could file an application to claim a federal land grant. Women were eligible. The occupant had to reside on the land for five years, and show evidence of having made improvements. The process had to be complete within seven years.\n\n\nThe act depleted the [[Native Americans in the United States]] of much of their land and natural resources as a result of it being allocated and sold to mostly white settlers. <ref> https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-native-americans-battled-a-brutal-land-grab-by-an-expanding-america/2016/11/04/69dd7c00-8402-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html </ref>\n\n===Southern Homestead Act of 1866===\n{{Main|Southern Homestead Act of 1866}}\nEnacted to allow poor [[tenant farmer]]s and [[sharecropper]]s in the south become land owners in the [[southern United States]] during Reconstruction.

This quarter-section could be added to an existing homestead claim, offering a total of 320 acres to a settler. This offered a cheap plot of land to homesteaders.\n\n===Kinkaid Amendment of 1904===\n{{Main|Kinkaid Act}}\nRecognizing that the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)]] of north-central Nebraska, required more than 160 acres for a claimant to support a family, Congress passed the Kinkaid Act which granted larger homestead tracts, up to 640 acres, to homesteaders in Nebraska.\n\n===Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909===\nBecause by the early 1900s much of the prime low-lying [[Alluvial plain|alluvial land]] along rivers had been homesteaded, the ''Enlarged Homestead Act'' was passed in 1909.

A common scheme was for an individual, acting as a front for a large cattle operation, to file for a homestead surrounding a water source, under the pretense that the land was to be used as a farm. Once the land was granted, other cattle ranchers would be denied the use of that water source, effectively closing off the adjacent public land to competition. That method was also used by large businesses and speculators to gain ownership of timber and oil-producing land. The federal government charged royalties for extraction of these resources from public lands. On the other hand, homesteading schemes were generally pointless for land containing \"locatable minerals,\" such as gold and silver, which could be controlled through mining claims under the [[Mining Act of 1872]], for which the federal government did not charge royalties.\n\nThe government developed no systematic method to evaluate claims under the homestead acts. Land offices relied on affidavits from witnesses that the claimant had lived on the land for the required period of time and made the required improvements. In practice, some of these witnesses were bribed or otherwise colluded with the claimant.\n\nAlthough not necessarily fraud, it was common practice for the eligible children of a large family to claim nearby land as soon as possible. After a few generations, a family could build up a sizable estate.<ref name=\"Hansen\">Hansen, Zeynep K., and Gary D. Libecap.

In all, more than {{convert|160|e6acre|e3km2 e3sqmi|abbr=unit}} of public land, or nearly 10&nbsp;percent of the total area of the United States, was given away free to 1.6&nbsp;million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nAn extension of the [[homestead principle]] in law, the Homestead Acts were an expression of the [[Free Soil]] policy of Northerners who wanted individual farmers to own and operate their own farms, as opposed to Southern slave-owners who wanted to buy up large tracts of land and use slave labor, thereby shutting out free white farmers.\n\nThe first of the acts, the Homestead Act of 1862, opened up millions of acres. Any adult who had never taken up arms against the [[Federal government of the United States]] could apply. Women and immigrants who had applied for citizenship were eligible. The 1866 Act explicitly included black Americans and encouraged them to participate, but rampant discrimination, systemic barriers and bureaucratic inertia slowed black gains.

An amendment to the Homestead Act of 1862, the Enlarged Homestead Act, was passed in 1909 and doubled the allotted acreage from {{convert|160|to|320|acres}} in marginal areas.

The [[Homestead Act of 1860]] did pass in Congress, but it was vetoed by President [[James Buchanan]], a Democrat.  After the Southern states seceded from the Union in 1861 (and their representatives had left Congress), the bill passed and was signed into law by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] (May 20, 1862).<ref name=\"nps homestead\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/home/faqs.htm |title=Homestead National Monument: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> [[Daniel Freeman (homesteader)|Daniel Freeman]] became the first person to file a claim under the new act.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1934, the federal government granted 1.6 million homesteads and distributed {{convert|270000000|acre|mi2}} of federal land for private ownership.

In these areas, people manipulated the provisions of the act to gain control of resources, especially water. A common scheme was for an individual, acting as a front for a large cattle operation, to file for a homestead surrounding a water source, under the pretense that the land was to be used as a farm. Once the land was granted, other cattle ranchers would be denied the use of that water source, effectively closing off the adjacent public land to competition. That method was also used by large businesses and speculators to gain ownership of timber and oil-producing land. The federal government charged royalties for extraction of these resources from public lands. On the other hand, homesteading schemes were generally pointless for land containing \"locatable minerals,\" such as gold and silver, which could be controlled through mining claims under the [[Mining Act of 1872]], for which the federal government did not charge royalties.\n\nThe government developed no systematic method to evaluate claims under the homestead acts. Land offices relied on affidavits from witnesses that the claimant had lived on the land for the required period of time and made the required improvements. In practice, some of these witnesses were bribed or otherwise colluded with the claimant.\n\nAlthough not necessarily fraud, it was common practice for the eligible children of a large family to claim nearby land as soon as possible. After a few generations, a family could build up a sizable estate.<ref name=\"Hansen\">Hansen, Zeynep K., and Gary D. Libecap.

Cawthon used [[Autodesk_3ds_Max|Autodesk 3ds Max]] to create 3D models of objects and characters for his games (such as ''Five Nights at Freddy's''), as well as [[Clickteam Fusion 2.5]] in order to develop most of his other games.<ref>https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-blog?p=interview-of-the-author-of-a-top-paid-game-in-appstore</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nThe beginning of Cawthon's career in game design and animation can be dated back to the 1990s. Cawthon revealed his first game (titled ''Doofas'') during a livestream,<ref>{{Citation|last=Dawko|title=Dawko's Charity Stream for American Red Cross PART 2|date=2017-09-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEHSb9duykU&t=3s|accessdate=2017-09-17}}</ref> which he made when he was a child. This game later became a troll game as the \"demo\" of ''[[Ultimate Custom Night]]''. His first official games were released in the early 2000s, one of the earliest known being ''RPG Max'', released in 2002. He later joined Hope Animation, where he created animations for children based on Christian values.\n\nOn March 19, 2007, Cawthon uploaded the first part of an eight-part series titled ''The Pilgrim's Progress'' to his [[YouTube]] channel. The animation is a retelling of [[John Bunyan]]'s [[The Pilgrim's Progress|novel of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/the-pilgrims-progress/|title=The Pilgrim's Progress - Christian Movie/Film DVD|work=Christian Movies All in One Place, Easy to Find!

Some of these were submitted to [[Steam (software)#Steam Greenlight|Steam Greenlight]]. While ''The Desolate Hope'' made it through the process, some games, most notably ''Chipper and Sons Lumber Co.'', were heavily criticized by prominent reviewers for having characters that moved and interacted with each other like animatronic machines. While initially discouraged, almost to the point of stopping game development completely, Cawthon eventually decided to use the animatronic-like characters to his advantage, sparking the development of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 3|developer=Scott Cawthon|date=March 2, 2015|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Ending (Nightmare)}}</ref>\n\n=== Five Nights at Freddy's ===\nOn June 13, 2014, Cawthon submitted ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' to Steam's Greenlight system on June 13, 2014. A trailer was released the following day on June 14 with a demo following on July 24, 2014. On July 24, 2014, he then submitted it to both [[Mod DB|IndieDB]], where it gained a massive amount of popularity. He submitted the game a third time to [[Desura]] on August 13, 2014. The game was accepted in Steam's Greenlight on August 18, 2014 and was released for $4.99. The game was well-received by critics,<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys|title=Five Nights at Freddy's on Metacritic|work=metacritic.com|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}</ref> and became the subject of numerous popular [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos on YouTube.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, Cawthon released the first sequel titled, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'' for $7.99 on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].  \n\nSoon after the release of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'', Cawthon removed all information from his official site and replaced it with an image of the word \"offline\". The website soon began to show teasers of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', which was released on March 2, 2015.\n\nOn July 23, 2015, Cawthon released the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 4|fourth game]] of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' horror series, entitled, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''. A free \"Halloween\" update was released on October 31, 2015.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, Cawthon announced the development of a new [[role-playing video game]] (RPG), titled ''[[FNaF World]]''.

Cawthon used [[Autodesk_3ds_Max|Autodesk 3ds Max]] to create 3D models of objects and characters for his games (such as ''Five Nights at Freddy's''), as well as [[Clickteam Fusion 2.5]] in order to develop most of his other games.<ref>https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-blog?p=interview-of-the-author-of-a-top-paid-game-in-appstore</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nThe beginning of Cawthon's career in game design and animation can be dated back to the 1990s. Cawthon revealed his first game (titled ''Doofas'') during a livestream,<ref>{{Citation|last=Dawko|title=Dawko's Charity Stream for American Red Cross PART 2|date=2017-09-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEHSb9duykU&t=3s|accessdate=2017-09-17}}</ref> which he made when he was a child. This game later became a troll game as the \"demo\" of ''[[Ultimate Custom Night]]''. His first official games were released in the early 2000s, one of the earliest known being ''RPG Max'', released in 2002. He later joined Hope Animation, where he created animations for children based on Christian values.\n\nOn March 19, 2007, Cawthon uploaded the first part of an eight-part series titled ''The Pilgrim's Progress'' to his [[YouTube]] channel. The animation is a retelling of [[John Bunyan]]'s [[The Pilgrim's Progress|novel of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/the-pilgrims-progress/|title=The Pilgrim's Progress - Christian Movie/Film DVD|work=Christian Movies All in One Place, Easy to Find!

Some of these were submitted to [[Steam (software)#Steam Greenlight|Steam Greenlight]]. While ''The Desolate Hope'' made it through the process, some games, most notably ''Chipper and Sons Lumber Co.'', were heavily criticized by prominent reviewers for having characters that moved and interacted with each other like animatronic machines. While initially discouraged, almost to the point of stopping game development completely, Cawthon eventually decided to use the animatronic-like characters to his advantage, sparking the development of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 3|developer=Scott Cawthon|date=March 2, 2015|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Ending (Nightmare)}}</ref>\n\n=== Five Nights at Freddy's ===\nOn June 13, 2014, Cawthon submitted ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' to Steam's Greenlight system on June 13, 2014. A trailer was released the following day on June 14 with a demo following on July 24, 2014. On July 24, 2014, he then submitted it to both [[Mod DB|IndieDB]], where it gained a massive amount of popularity. He submitted the game a third time to [[Desura]] on August 13, 2014. The game was accepted in Steam's Greenlight on August 18, 2014 and was released for $4.99. The game was well-received by critics,<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys|title=Five Nights at Freddy's on Metacritic|work=metacritic.com|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}</ref> and became the subject of numerous popular [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos on YouTube.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, Cawthon released the first sequel titled, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'' for $7.99 on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].  \n\nSoon after the release of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'', Cawthon removed all information from his official site and replaced it with an image of the word \"offline\". The website soon began to show teasers of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', which was released on March 2, 2015.\n\nOn July 23, 2015, Cawthon released the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 4|fourth game]] of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' horror series, entitled, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''. A free \"Halloween\" update was released on October 31, 2015.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, Cawthon announced the development of a new [[role-playing video game]] (RPG), titled ''[[FNaF World]]''. The game is not a horror game; rather, it is a stylized RPG. It was released on January 21, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: Five Nights at Freddy's 4|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/388090/announcements/detail/124202807772796833|website = steamcommunity.com|accessdate = October 22, 2015}}</ref> Four days later, Cawthon pulled it from Steam, not satisfied with the results, and released an improved version on [[Game Jolt|Gamejolt]] for free on February 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/388090/announcements/detail/92689497772897600|title=Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: Five Nights at Freddy's 4|website=steamcommunity.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, Scott Cawthon released teasers for his first novel, ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Untold Story,'' soon to be renamed ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes]]''.
