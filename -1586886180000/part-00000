Either it is [[contemporary folk]] songs with large, sweeping [[pop music|pop]] arrangements, or pop songs with intimate, [[acoustic music|acoustic]]-based folk arrangements. Folk-pop developed during the 1960s folk music and [[folk rock]] boom. Folk-pop doesn't have ringing guitars and rougher edges of folk-rock; rather it's softer, gentler, and more pop-oriented.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/style/folk-pop-ma0000005011 Folk-Pop] [[AllMusic]]</ref>\n\n== History (1960's-1970's) ==\n{{See also|Folk rock}}\nFolk pop is played in many regions such as America, Europe, [[Balkans]] and others.

Folk pop emerged in the 1960's along with folk rock as part of the 1960s [[Folk music|folk]] revival. Folk pop and folk rock were popular into the mid-1970's, but fell off when [[Disco music|disco]] took over. [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] (sometimes with [[Neil Young]]) would record folk pop/rock songs. They had hits such as [[Ohio (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Ohio]], [[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]], and [[Carry On (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Carry On]]. During the mid-70s, the members of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young would separate and launch solo careers or duo projects with members of CSNY. These would include [[Crosby & Nash]] and the [[Stills-Young Band]] which recorded the album [[Long May You Run]]. Originally, the album was to be a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reunion album, but [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] had to leave the sessions early due to obligations stemming from their Crosby & Nash project. This frustrated [[Stephen Stills]] and Neil Young, who removed their parts from the album and transformed it into a [[Buffalo Springfield]]-esk album with traces of [[Jazz music|jazz]] and [[art rock]]. Stephen Stills and Neil Young would also have solo careers. Stills had a one-hit wonder with [[Love The One You're With]] while Neil Young was arguably the most successful of them all with a solo career spanning from 1969 to the present, spawned hits such as [[Rocking in the Free World]], and saw him backed by bands such as [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Booker T. and the MGs]], and [[Promise of the Real]] among other. Crazy Horse is Young's longest serving backing band. Other folk pop artists of the 1970s include [[Simon and Garfunkel]], which scored hits such as [[Mrs. Robinson]], [[Sound of Silence]], [[Cecilia (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]], and [[Bridge Over Troubled Water]] among others. The duo broke up due to tension between [[Paul Simon]] and [[Art Garfunkel]], but nonetheless, they have reunited a handful of times since then. Paul Simon would also embark on a very successful solo career after leaving Simon and Garfunkel. He would score hits such as [[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]], [[Kodachrome (song)|Kodachrome]], and his most popular hit [[You Can Call Me Al]] among others. [[England Dan & John Ford Coley]] and [[Seals & Crofts]] would also have folk pop hits as would [[Don McLean]], who hit big with [[American Pie (song)|American Pie]].\n\n== 1980s ==\nFolk pop saw a decline in the 1980s with few artists embracing the genre. However, [[Steve Goodman]] would have a folk-pop one-hit wonder in 1984 with [[Go, Cubs, Go]], a song about the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball team.\n\n== 1990s ==\nIn the mid 1990s, folk-pop had a resurgence thanks to artists such as [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Joan Osborne]], and [[Fiona Apple]] embracing the genre. Out of all of them Sheryl Crow and Jewel had the most folk pop hits, continuing into the 2000s. Sheryl Crow hit big with the album [[Tuesday Night Music Club]], Jewel with [[You Were Meant for Me (Jewel song)|You Were Meant For Me]], Joan Osborne with [[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One Of Us]], and Fiona Apple with [[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]].\n\n== 2000s ==\nSheryl Crow and Jewel would be the genre's leaders in the 2000s where they continued their successes with hits such as [[Soak Up the Sun]] and [[Standing Still (Jewel song)|Standing Still]] among others.\n\n== 2010s ==\nFolk pop continued its mid-1990s revival with artists such as [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Passenger]] and [[Shawn Mendes]] having folk-pop hits. They would have such hits as [[The A Team (Ed Sheeran song)|A Team]], [[Lego House]], [[Sing (Ed Sheeran song)|Sing]], [[Heart's on Fire (Passenger song)|Hearts on Fire]], [[Let Her Go]], [[Stitches (Shawn Mendes song)|Stitches]], and [[If I Can't Have You (Shawn Mendes song)|If I Can't Have You]] among others. Also in the 2010s, folk-pop would become popular with certain [[Alternative rock|alternative]]/[[Indie rock|indie]] artists as well, with their work being tagged as  [[indie folk]].\n\n== Balkan pop-folk ==\nIn the [[Balkans]] region of [[Southeastern Europe]], (Balkan) '''pop-folk''' is an umbrella term for genres of Balkan popular music that blend pop, folk and ethnic music. It's the modern counterpart of Balkan folk music, in which the dominant rhythms are influenced by oriental music, especially [[Arabic music]] and [[Romani music|Romani folk music]]. Much of this music could be defined as a mix of traditional Balkan folk music and [[dance-pop]]. Balkan pop-folk music is a part of the ethnic pop-folk style which is spread at the junction area of Asia and Europe, which also includes genres like [[Arabesque (Turkish music)|Arabesque]] from Turkey, [[Mizrahi music]] from Israel and [[Rabiz]] from Armenia.

He volunteered for an [[Military intelligence|intelligence]]-gathering mission in [[New York City]] but was captured by the British and executed. Hale has long been considered an American hero and, in 1985, he was officially designated the state hero of [[Connecticut]].<ref name=\"hero\"/>\n\n==Background==\nNathan Hale was born in [[Coventry, Connecticut]], in 1755, to Richard Hale and Elizabeth Strong. In 1769, when he was fourteen years old, he was sent with his brother Enoch, who was sixteen, to [[Yale College]]. Nathan was a classmate of fellow [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] spy [[Benjamin Tallmadge]].<ref name=NHweb/> The Hale brothers belonged to the [[Linonian Society]] of Yale, which debated topics in astronomy, mathematics, literature, and the ethics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Nathan graduated with first-class honors in 1773 at age 18 and became a teacher, first in [[East Haddam, Connecticut|East Haddam]] and later in [[New London, Connecticut|New London]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Capt.

It has been suggested that he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or possibly that he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, \"Was I in your condition, I think the more extensive service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honor of our God, a glorious country, & a happy constitution is what we have to defend.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1428600434|title=Documentary Life of Nathan Hale|work=google.com}}</ref> Tallmadge's letter was so inspiring that, several days later, Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the [[7th Connecticut Regiment]] under Colonel Charles Webb of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]].\n\nHale was also a part of [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the first organized [[intelligence service]] organization of the [[United States of America]], led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Thomas Knowlton]]. In the spring of 1776, the Continental Army moved to [[Manhattan Island|Manhattan]] to defend New York City against the anticipated British attack. In August, the British soundly defeated the Continentals in the [[Battle of Long Island]] via a flanking move from [[Staten Island]] across [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. General [[George Washington]] was desperate to determine the location of the imminent British invasion of Manhattan; to that end, Washington called for a spy behind enemy lines, and Hale was the only volunteer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n<center>\n{|\n|[[File:Nathan Hale commission as captain in the nineteenth regiment of foot.jpg|thumb|right|Commission of Nathan Hale, captain in nineteenth regiment of foot commanded by Colonel Charles Webb.

Hale planned to disguise himself as a Dutch schoolteacher looking for work,<ref>{{cite book|last=McCullough|first=David|title=1776|year=2005|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4|author-link=David McCullough|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uu1mC6zWNTwC}}</ref> though he did not travel under an assumed name and reportedly carried with him his Yale diploma bearing his real name.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith, Jr. |first1=John L. |title=9 Rules of Spying That Nathan Hale Failed to Follow |url=https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/05/9-rules-of-spying-that-nathan-hale-failed-to-follow/#_edn17 |website=Journal of the American Revolution |accessdate=13 November 2019 |date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile Hale was undercover, New York City (then the area at the southern tip of Manhattan, mostly south of what is now Chambers Street) fell to British forces on September 15, and Washington was forced to retreat to the island's north in [[Battle of Harlem Heights|Harlem Heights]] (what is now [[Morningside Heights]]).{{sfn|Neff|p=299\u2013308}} Shortly after, on September 21, a quarter of the lower portion of Manhattan burned in the [[Great New York Fire of 1776]]. The fire was later widely thought to have been started by American saboteurs in order to keep the city from falling into British hands,<ref name=\"fire\"/> and though [[scorched earth|setting fire]] to New York during Washington's retreat had indeed been proposed, Washington and the [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] had rejected the idea and denied responsibility for the fire after its outbreak. It has also been speculated that the fire was the work of British soldiers acting without orders. In the fire's aftermath, more than 200 American [[Partisan (political)|partisans]] were detained by the British for questioning.\n\nAn account of Hale's capture, later obtained by the [[Library of Congress]], was written by [[Consider Tiffany]], a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist. In Tiffany's account, Major [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] of the [[Queen's York Rangers|Queen's Rangers]] saw Hale in a tavern and recognized him despite his disguise. After luring Hale into betraying his allegiance by pretending to be a Patriot himself, Rogers and his Rangers apprehended Hale near [[Flushing Bay]] in [[Queens]], New York.<ref name=\"betray\"/> Another story is that Hale's cousin, a Loyalist named Samuel Hale, was the one who revealed his true identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nBritish General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] had established his headquarters in the Beekman House in a then-rural part of Manhattan, on a rise between what are now [[50th Street (Manhattan)|50th]] and [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st]] Streets between First and Second Avenues,{{sfn|Haswell|p=22}} near where [[Beekman Place]] commemorates the connection. Hale reportedly was questioned by Howe, and physical evidence was found on him. Rogers provided information about the case. According to tradition, Hale spent the night in a greenhouse at the mansion. He requested a Bible; his request was denied. Sometime later, he requested a clergyman. Again, the request was denied.\n\nAccording to the standards of the time, spies were [[hanging|hanged]] as [[illegal combatant]]s. On the morning of September 22, 1776, Hale was marched along [[Boston Post Road#Manhattan|Post Road]] to the Park of Artillery, which was next to a public house called the Dove Tavern (at modern-day [[66th Street (Manhattan)|66th]] Street and [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]]), and hanged.<ref name=ctssar/> He was 21 years old.\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Nathan Hale 1925 Issue-half-cent.jpg|thumb|Nathan Hale appeared on U.S. postage stamps issued in 1925 and 1929.

Soon after the execution, Montresor allegedly spoke with the American officer [[William Hull]] about Hale's death. Hull later publicized Hale's quote. Because Hull was not an eyewitness to Hale's speech, some historians have questioned the reliability of this account.<ref name=ctssar/>\n\nIf Hale did not originate the statement, it is possible he instead repeated a passage from [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''[[Cato (tragedy)|Cato]]'',{{sfn|Seymour|p=xxxii}} which was widely popular at the time and an ideological inspiration to many [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]]:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nHow beautiful is death, when earn'd by virtue!\nWho would not be that youth?

However, Frederick MacKensie, a British officer, wrote this diary entry for the day:{{sfn|Seymour|p=292}}\n\n{{quote |He behaved with great composure and resolution, saying he thought it the duty of every good Officer, to obey any orders given him by his Commander-in-Chief; and desired the Spectators to be at all times prepared to meet death in whatever shape it might appear.}}\n\nIt is almost certain that Hale's last speech contained more than one sentence. Several early accounts mention different things he said. These are not necessarily contradictory, but rather, together they give an idea of what the speech might have been like. The following quotes are all taken from George Dudley Seymour's book, ''Documentary Life of Nathan Hale'', published in 1941 by the author.\n\nFrom the diary of Enoch Hale, Nathan's brother, after he went to question people who had been present, October 26, 1776: \"When at the Gallows he spoke & told them that he was a Capt in the Cont Army by name Nathan Hale.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=301}}\n\nFrom the ''Essex Journal'', February 13, 1777: \"However, at the gallows, he made a sensible and spirited speech; among other things, told them they were shedding the blood of the innocent, and that if he had ten thousand lives, he would lay them all down, if called to it, in defence of his injured, bleeding Country.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=303}}\n\nFrom the ''Independent Chronicle and the Universal Advertiser'', May 17, 1781: \"I am so satisfied with the cause in which I have engaged, that my only regret is, that I have not more lives than one to offer in its service.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=327}}\n\nFrom the memoirs of Captain William Hull, quoting British Captain John Montresor, who was present and who spoke to Hull under a flag of truce the next day:\n\n{{quote|\"On the morning of his execution,\" continued the officer, \"my station was near the fatal spot, and I requested the [[Provost Marshal]] [William Cunningham] to permit the prisoner to sit in my marquee, while he was making the necessary preparations. Captain Hale entered: he was calm, and bore himself with gentle dignity, in the consciousness of rectitude and high intentions. He asked for writing materials, which I furnished him: he wrote two letters, one to his mother and one to a brother officer. He was shortly after summoned to the [[gallows]]. But a few persons were around him, yet his characteristic dying words were remembered. He said, 'I only regret, that I have but one life to lose for my country.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Seymour|p=310}}}}\n\nTwo early ballads also attempt to recreate Hale's last speech. ''Songs and Ballads of the Revolution'' (1855), collected by F. Moore, contained the \"Ballad of Nathan Hale\" (anonymous), dated 1776: \"Thou pale king of terrors, thou life's gloomy foe, Go frighten the slave; go frighten the slave; Tell tyrants, to you their allegiance they owe. No fears for the brave; no fears for the brave.\";{{sfn|Seymour|p=356}} and \"To the Memory of Capt. Nathan Hale\" by Eneas Munson, Sr., was written soon after Hale's death:{{sfn|Seymour|p=361}}\n\n{{poemquote|\"Hate of oppression's arbitrary plan,\nThe love of freedom, and the rights of man;\nA strong desire to save from slavery's chain\nThe future millions of the western main,\nAnd hand down safe, from men's invention cleared,\nThe sacred truths which all the just revered;\nFor ends like these, I wish to draw my breath,\"\nHe bravely cried, \"or dare encounter death.\"\nAnd when a cruel wretch pronounced his doom,\nReplied, {{\"'}}Tis well,\u2014for all is peace to come;\nThe sacred cause for which I drew my sword\nShall yet prevail, and peace shall be restored.\nI've served with zeal the land that gave me birth,\nFulfilled my course, and done my work on earth;\nHave ever aimed to tread that shining road\nThat leads a mortal to the blessed God.\nI die resigned, and quit life's empty stage,\nFor brighter worlds my every wish engage;\nAnd while my body slumbers in the dust,\nMy soul shall join the assemblies of the just.\"}}\n\nMunson had tutored Hale before college, and knew him and his family well, so even though the particulars of this speech may be unlikely, Munson knew first-hand what Hale's opinions were.\n\n==Hanging site==\n[[File:Nathan Hale hanged by British 1776.gif|thumb|The British hang Nathan Hale in New York City, 1776]]\nAside from the site at 66th Street and Third Avenue, three other sites in [[Manhattan]] claim to be the hanging site:\n* [[City Hall Park, Manhattan|City Hall Park]], where a statue of Hale designed by [[Frederick William MacMonnies]] was erected in 1890<ref name=nym>{{cite magazine|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/robert-sullivan-my-american-revolution-2012-9/|title=Permanent Revolution|magazine=New York magazine|date=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n* Inside [[Grand Central Terminal]]<ref name=nym/>\n* The [[Yale Club of New York City|Yale Club]] at [[44th Street (Manhattan)|44th Street]] and [[Vanderbilt Avenue#Manhattan|Vanderbilt Avenue]], near [[Grand Central Terminal]], where the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] hung a plaque which states the event occurred \"near\" the site<ref>https://untappedcities.com/2011/02/11/nathan-hale-banana-republic/</ref>\n\nAnother account places Hale's execution at [[Bergen Beach, Brooklyn]], but there is no evidence to support this claim.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Frederick R. |url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/gate/jamaica_bay_hrs.pdf |title=JAMAICA BAY: A HISTORY |publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]], [[National Park Service]] |date=1981 |pages=11\u201312 }}</ref>\n\nNathan Hale's body has never been found.

It has been suggested that he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or possibly that he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, \"Was I in your condition, I think the more extensive service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honor of our God, a glorious country, & a happy constitution is what we have to defend.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1428600434|title=Documentary Life of Nathan Hale|work=google.com}}</ref> Tallmadge's letter was so inspiring that, several days later, Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the [[7th Connecticut Regiment]] under Colonel Charles Webb of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]].\n\nHale was also a part of [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the first organized [[intelligence service]] organization of the [[United States of America]], led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Thomas Knowlton]]. In the spring of 1776, the Continental Army moved to [[Manhattan Island|Manhattan]] to defend New York City against the anticipated British attack. In August, the British soundly defeated the Continentals in the [[Battle of Long Island]] via a flanking move from [[Staten Island]] across [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. General [[George Washington]] was desperate to determine the location of the imminent British invasion of Manhattan; to that end, Washington called for a spy behind enemy lines, and Hale was the only volunteer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n<center>\n{|\n|[[File:Nathan Hale commission as captain in the nineteenth regiment of foot.jpg|thumb|right|Commission of Nathan Hale, captain in nineteenth regiment of foot commanded by Colonel Charles Webb.

It was an act of [[Espionage|spying]] that was immediately punishable by death and posed a great risk to Hale. He was ferried across the [[East River]] to [[Huntington, New York]], on British-controlled Long Island, on September 12. Hale planned to disguise himself as a Dutch schoolteacher looking for work,<ref>{{cite book|last=McCullough|first=David|title=1776|year=2005|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4|author-link=David McCullough|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uu1mC6zWNTwC}}</ref> though he did not travel under an assumed name and reportedly carried with him his Yale diploma bearing his real name.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith, Jr. |first1=John L. |title=9 Rules of Spying That Nathan Hale Failed to Follow |url=https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/05/9-rules-of-spying-that-nathan-hale-failed-to-follow/#_edn17 |website=Journal of the American Revolution |accessdate=13 November 2019 |date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile Hale was undercover, New York City (then the area at the southern tip of Manhattan, mostly south of what is now Chambers Street) fell to British forces on September 15, and Washington was forced to retreat to the island's north in [[Battle of Harlem Heights|Harlem Heights]] (what is now [[Morningside Heights]]).{{sfn|Neff|p=299\u2013308}} Shortly after, on September 21, a quarter of the lower portion of Manhattan burned in the [[Great New York Fire of 1776]]. The fire was later widely thought to have been started by American saboteurs in order to keep the city from falling into British hands,<ref name=\"fire\"/> and though [[scorched earth|setting fire]] to New York during Washington's retreat had indeed been proposed, Washington and the [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] had rejected the idea and denied responsibility for the fire after its outbreak. It has also been speculated that the fire was the work of British soldiers acting without orders. In the fire's aftermath, more than 200 American [[Partisan (political)|partisans]] were detained by the British for questioning.\n\nAn account of Hale's capture, later obtained by the [[Library of Congress]], was written by [[Consider Tiffany]], a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist. In Tiffany's account, Major [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] of the [[Queen's York Rangers|Queen's Rangers]] saw Hale in a tavern and recognized him despite his disguise. After luring Hale into betraying his allegiance by pretending to be a Patriot himself, Rogers and his Rangers apprehended Hale near [[Flushing Bay]] in [[Queens]], New York.<ref name=\"betray\"/> Another story is that Hale's cousin, a Loyalist named Samuel Hale, was the one who revealed his true identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nBritish General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] had established his headquarters in the Beekman House in a then-rural part of Manhattan, on a rise between what are now [[50th Street (Manhattan)|50th]] and [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st]] Streets between First and Second Avenues,{{sfn|Haswell|p=22}} near where [[Beekman Place]] commemorates the connection. Hale reportedly was questioned by Howe, and physical evidence was found on him. Rogers provided information about the case. According to tradition, Hale spent the night in a greenhouse at the mansion. He requested a Bible; his request was denied. Sometime later, he requested a clergyman. Again, the request was denied.\n\nAccording to the standards of the time, spies were [[hanging|hanged]] as [[illegal combatant]]s. On the morning of September 22, 1776, Hale was marched along [[Boston Post Road#Manhattan|Post Road]] to the Park of Artillery, which was next to a public house called the Dove Tavern (at modern-day [[66th Street (Manhattan)|66th]] Street and [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]]), and hanged.<ref name=ctssar/> He was 21 years old.\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Nathan Hale 1925 Issue-half-cent.jpg|thumb|Nathan Hale appeared on U.S. postage stamps issued in 1925 and 1929. The likeness is from a statue by [[Bela Lyon Pratt]].]]\nBy all accounts, Hale comported himself well before the hanging.{{sfn|Seymour|p=292}}{{sfn|Seymour|p=xxxi}}{{sfn|Seymour|p=438}} It has traditionally been reported that his last words, either entirely or in part, were: \"I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.\" Over the years, there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether or not he specifically uttered this line, or some variant of it.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A Possible Source for Nathan Hale's Dying Words|jstor = 1918934|journal = The William and Mary Quarterly|date = January 1, 1985|pages = 394\u2013396|volume = 42|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1918934|first = F. K.|last = Donnelly}}</ref> The line may be an abbreviation of: \"I am so satisfied with the cause in which I have engaged that my only regret is that I have not more lives than one to offer in its service.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=327}}\n\nThe story of Hale's quote began with [[John Montresor]], a British officer who witnessed the hanging. Soon after the execution, Montresor allegedly spoke with the American officer [[William Hull]] about Hale's death. Hull later publicized Hale's quote. Because Hull was not an eyewitness to Hale's speech, some historians have questioned the reliability of this account.<ref name=ctssar/>\n\nIf Hale did not originate the statement, it is possible he instead repeated a passage from [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''[[Cato (tragedy)|Cato]]'',{{sfn|Seymour|p=xxxii}} which was widely popular at the time and an ideological inspiration to many [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]]:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nHow beautiful is death, when earn'd by virtue!\nWho would not be that youth? What pity is it\nThat we can die but once to serve our country.\n</poem>}}\n\nNo official records were kept of Hale's speech. However, Frederick MacKensie, a British officer, wrote this diary entry for the day:{{sfn|Seymour|p=292}}\n\n{{quote |He behaved with great composure and resolution, saying he thought it the duty of every good Officer, to obey any orders given him by his Commander-in-Chief; and desired the Spectators to be at all times prepared to meet death in whatever shape it might appear.}}\n\nIt is almost certain that Hale's last speech contained more than one sentence. Several early accounts mention different things he said. These are not necessarily contradictory, but rather, together they give an idea of what the speech might have been like. The following quotes are all taken from George Dudley Seymour's book, ''Documentary Life of Nathan Hale'', published in 1941 by the author.\n\nFrom the diary of Enoch Hale, Nathan's brother, after he went to question people who had been present, October 26, 1776: \"When at the Gallows he spoke & told them that he was a Capt in the Cont Army by name Nathan Hale.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=301}}\n\nFrom the ''Essex Journal'', February 13, 1777: \"However, at the gallows, he made a sensible and spirited speech; among other things, told them they were shedding the blood of the innocent, and that if he had ten thousand lives, he would lay them all down, if called to it, in defence of his injured, bleeding Country.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=303}}\n\nFrom the ''Independent Chronicle and the Universal Advertiser'', May 17, 1781: \"I am so satisfied with the cause in which I have engaged, that my only regret is, that I have not more lives than one to offer in its service.\"{{sfn|Seymour|p=327}}\n\nFrom the memoirs of Captain William Hull, quoting British Captain John Montresor, who was present and who spoke to Hull under a flag of truce the next day:\n\n{{quote|\"On the morning of his execution,\" continued the officer, \"my station was near the fatal spot, and I requested the [[Provost Marshal]] [William Cunningham] to permit the prisoner to sit in my marquee, while he was making the necessary preparations. Captain Hale entered: he was calm, and bore himself with gentle dignity, in the consciousness of rectitude and high intentions. He asked for writing materials, which I furnished him: he wrote two letters, one to his mother and one to a brother officer. He was shortly after summoned to the [[gallows]]. But a few persons were around him, yet his characteristic dying words were remembered. He said, 'I only regret, that I have but one life to lose for my country.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Seymour|p=310}}}}\n\nTwo early ballads also attempt to recreate Hale's last speech. ''Songs and Ballads of the Revolution'' (1855), collected by F. Moore, contained the \"Ballad of Nathan Hale\" (anonymous), dated 1776: \"Thou pale king of terrors, thou life's gloomy foe, Go frighten the slave; go frighten the slave; Tell tyrants, to you their allegiance they owe. No fears for the brave; no fears for the brave.\";{{sfn|Seymour|p=356}} and \"To the Memory of Capt. Nathan Hale\" by Eneas Munson, Sr., was written soon after Hale's death:{{sfn|Seymour|p=361}}\n\n{{poemquote|\"Hate of oppression's arbitrary plan,\nThe love of freedom, and the rights of man;\nA strong desire to save from slavery's chain\nThe future millions of the western main,\nAnd hand down safe, from men's invention cleared,\nThe sacred truths which all the just revered;\nFor ends like these, I wish to draw my breath,\"\nHe bravely cried, \"or dare encounter death.\"\nAnd when a cruel wretch pronounced his doom,\nReplied, {{\"'}}Tis well,\u2014for all is peace to come;\nThe sacred cause for which I drew my sword\nShall yet prevail, and peace shall be restored.\nI've served with zeal the land that gave me birth,\nFulfilled my course, and done my work on earth;\nHave ever aimed to tread that shining road\nThat leads a mortal to the blessed God.\nI die resigned, and quit life's empty stage,\nFor brighter worlds my every wish engage;\nAnd while my body slumbers in the dust,\nMy soul shall join the assemblies of the just.\"}}\n\nMunson had tutored Hale before college, and knew him and his family well, so even though the particulars of this speech may be unlikely, Munson knew first-hand what Hale's opinions were.\n\n==Hanging site==\n[[File:Nathan Hale hanged by British 1776.gif|thumb|The British hang Nathan Hale in New York City, 1776]]\nAside from the site at 66th Street and Third Avenue, three other sites in [[Manhattan]] claim to be the hanging site:\n* [[City Hall Park, Manhattan|City Hall Park]], where a statue of Hale designed by [[Frederick William MacMonnies]] was erected in 1890<ref name=nym>{{cite magazine|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/robert-sullivan-my-american-revolution-2012-9/|title=Permanent Revolution|magazine=New York magazine|date=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n* Inside [[Grand Central Terminal]]<ref name=nym/>\n* The [[Yale Club of New York City|Yale Club]] at [[44th Street (Manhattan)|44th Street]] and [[Vanderbilt Avenue#Manhattan|Vanderbilt Avenue]], near [[Grand Central Terminal]], where the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] hung a plaque which states the event occurred \"near\" the site<ref>https://untappedcities.com/2011/02/11/nathan-hale-banana-republic/</ref>\n\nAnother account places Hale's execution at [[Bergen Beach, Brooklyn]], but there is no evidence to support this claim.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Frederick R. |url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/gate/jamaica_bay_hrs.pdf |title=JAMAICA BAY: A HISTORY |publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]], [[National Park Service]] |date=1981 |pages=11\u201312 }}</ref>\n\nNathan Hale's body has never been found.
