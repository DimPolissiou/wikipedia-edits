It is located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in [[Los Angeles]].\n\nIn 1991, Perkins was honored with the Donostia Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]].\n\nAlthough he was suffering from [[AIDS]], he appeared in eight television productions between 1990 and 1992, including ''[[Daughter of Darkness (1990 film)|Daughter of Darkness]]'' (1990) and ''The Naked Target'' (1992). He made his final appearance in ''[[In the Deep Woods]]'' (1992) with [[Rosanna Arquette]]. He had agreed to provide the voice for the role of the dentist, Dr. Wolfe, in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Last Exit to Springfield]]\" but died before the part could be recorded. In the end, the character was voiced by ''Simpsons'' regular [[Hank Azaria]].<ref name=\"Jean\">{{cite video|people=Jean, Al|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Last Exit to Springfield\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nPerkins was portrayed by British actor [[James D'Arcy]] in the 2012 biographical drama ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'', which starred [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Alma Reville]].\n\n==Personal life==\nPerkins was an extremely shy person, especially in the company of women.<ref name=People>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085251,00.html|title=Return of Psycho|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Brad|last=Darrach|volume=19|issue=23|date=June 13, 1983|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> According to the posthumous biography ''Split Image'' by Charles Winecoff, he had exclusively [[same-sex relationships]] until his late 30s, including with actor [[Tab Hunter]]; artist [[Christopher Makos]]; dancer [[Rudolf Nureyev]]; composer/lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]]; and dancer-choreographer [[Grover Dale]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Winecoff|first=Charles|title=Split Image: The Life of Anthony Perkins|location=New York City|publisher=Dutton|date=1996|isbn=0-525-94064-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/splitimagelifeof00winerich}}</ref> Perkins has been described as one of the two great men in the life of French songwriter {{ill|Patrick Loiseau|fr}}.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.closermag.fr/article/la-mst-de-dave-son-compagnon-raconte-78352|title=La MST de Dave: son compagnon raconte\u2026|language=fr|magazine=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]|date=May 2, 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPerkins reportedly had his first heterosexual experience at age 39 with actress [[Victoria Principal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20119696,00.html |title=Great Factoids |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=19|issue=23 |date=March 6, 1989 |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920012637/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20119696%2C00.html |archivedate=September 20, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Dana|title=Split Image: The Life of Anthony Perkins|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/09/20/split-image-life-anthony-perkins/amp|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 5, 2017|date=September 20, 1996}}</ref> \non location filming ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]'' in 1971.<ref name=People/> He met photographer [[Berry Berenson|Berinthia \"Berry\" Berenson]], the younger sister of actress and model [[Marisa Berenson]], at a party in New York City in 1972.<ref name=People/> They married when he was aged 41 and she was 25, on August 9, 1973 and had two sons: actor [[Oz Perkins]] (b.

Identification of a specific culture of Asia or universal elements among the colossal diversity that has emanated from multiple cultural spheres and three of the [[River valley civilization|four ancient River valley civilizations]] is complicated. However, the continent is commonly divided into six geographic sub-regions, that are characterized by perceivable commonalities, like religion, language and relative ethnic homogeneity. These regions are [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[West Asia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ |title= Geographic Regions |publisher=United Nations | date= |author= |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the largest, most populous continent and rich in resources, Asia is home to several of the world's oldest civilizations, that produced the majority of the great religious systems, the oldest known recorded [[myth]]s and [[Codex|codices]] on ethics and morality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/population/ |title= Population |publisher=UNITED NATIONS|date= 14 December 2015|author= |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/asia-human/ |title= Asia: Human Geography |publisher=National Geographic Society|date= |author= |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Asia's enormous size separates the various civilizations by great distances and hostile environments, such as deserts and mountain ranges. Yet by challenging and overcoming these distances, trade and commerce gradually developed a truly universal, [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] character. Inter-regional trade was the driving and cohesive force, by which cultural elements and ideas spread to the various sub-regions via the vast road network and the many sea routes.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=lTEeCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA299&lpg=PA299&dq=Indianized+kingdoms#v=onepage&q=Indianized%20kingdoms&f=false | title= Societies, Networks, and Transitions, Volume I: To 1500: A Global History |date= 2014-06-19| accessdate=March 31, 2018 | isbn= 9781285783086 | last1= Lockard | first1= Craig A. }}</ref>\n<!-- EDITORIAL NOTE: The '''culture of Asia''' consist of different kinds of [[cultural heritage]] of many [[Nationality|nationalities]], [[Society|societies]], and [[ethnic group]]s from the continent of [[Asia]]. The continent is commonly divided into geographic and cultural [[subregion]]s, including [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[West Asia]]. While linked together on a geographical continent, there has been little unity or common history between the many cultures and peoples there. [[Asian art]], [[Asian music|music]], and [[Asian cuisine|cuisine]], as well as [[Asian literature|literature]] are all important parts of Asian culture. [[Eastern philosophy]] and religion, including [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], also play major roles. One of the most complex parts of modern Asian culture is the [[East\u2013West dichotomy]], as increasing Western influence clashes with traditional ideals.\n\n== Nationalities and ethnic groups ==\nThere is an abundance of ethnic and racial groups throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia. Some groups are primarily [[hunter-gatherer]]s, some practice [[transhumance]] (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others are becoming industrial/urban. Some nationalities are completely urban, like in [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Colonial rule in Asia largely died out by the late 20th century due to national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.-->\n\n== Multiple cultural centers ==\nAsia's various modern cultural and religious spheres correspond roughly with the principal centers of civilization.\n\nWest Asia (or Southwest Asia as [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morrison]] puts it, or sometimes referred to as the [[Middle East]]) has their cultural roots in the pioneering civilizations of the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Mesopotamia]], spawning the [[Iran|Persian]], [[Arab world|Arab]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of [[Judaism]] and later [[Islam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Mesopotamia|author=Dominique Collon |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref> According to Morrison, in his book ''Why the West Rules--For Now,'' these original civilizations of the [[Hilly flanks|Hilly Flanks]] are so far (by archaeological evidence) the oldest (first evidence of farming c9000 BC). The [[Hilly flanks]] is also the birthplace of his definition of the [[Western world|west]] (which groups the Middle East with Europe). According to his definition this would make Asia the origin of western culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Why the West rules - for now : the patterns of history, and what they reveal about the future|last=Morris, Ian|date=2011|publisher=Profile|isbn=9781846682087|oclc=751789199}}</ref> Not everybody agrees with him though.\n\n[[South Asia]], India and the [[Indosphere]] emanate from the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&dq=Upinder+Singh&q=malvan#v=snippet&q=malvan&f=false|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age|author=Upinder Singh|year=2008|isbn=9788131711200|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[East Asian cultural sphere]] developed from the [[Yellow River civilization]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/92826/2/CARR3.pdf |title= Water Management in the Yellow River Basin  |publisher=AgEcon|date=  |author=Mark Giordano, Zhongping Zhu, Ximing Cai, Shangqi Hong, Xuecheng Zhang, Yunpeng Xue  |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref> [[Southeast Asia]]'s migration waves of more varied ethnic groups are relatively recent.

This is because [[Classical Chinese]] was long the written language of all China, and was replaced by [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as the national written language in the twentieth century.  Chinese writing was passed to [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]] in the post-classical era. In Japan, the set of Chinese characters used are called [[Kanji]] and form a major component of the Japanese writing system.   In the 9th century, the Japanese developed their own writing system called [[Kana]] ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) which support Kanji, thus establishing the Japanese language. Today, both [[ideograph]] Kanji and [[syllabary]] Kana is used in mixture in Japanese. In Vietnam, Chinese script (Han Tu) was used during the millennium under the influence of China, with the vernacular [[Chu Nom]] script are also used since the 13th century. However, this has now (since the early 20th century) been replaced completely by the Latin Alphabet-based [[Quoc Ngu]]. In the 15th century, Korea developed an alphabet system called Hangul to make writing and communication easier for its commoners.\n\nThough Korea, Japan and Vietnam are not Chinese speaking regions, their languages have been influenced by the Chinese greatly. However, most of these languages are different enough from Chinese to be considered parts of different language families, such as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], an [[Austro-Asiatic language]]; [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a [[Japonic language]]; and Korean, a [[Koreanic language]]; all differing from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a [[Sino-Tibetan language]]. Even though their writing systems have changed over time, Chinese is still found in the historical roots of many borrowed words. In modern times, Chinese is also influenced by other Asian languages, such as by modern technical and political terms created in Japan to represent western concepts. For example, \u6587\u5316 (culture), \u6587\u660e (civilization), \u4eba\u6c11 (people), \u7d4c\u6e08 (economy), \u5171\u548c (republic) and \u54f2\u5b66 (philosophy) are borrowed words from Japanese to Chinese, known as ''[[wasei-kango]]''. Apart from the unifying influence of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Chinese characters]], and other [[Culture of China|Chinese Cultural Influences]],\n\nthere is nevertheless much diversity between the countries of the region such as different religions, national costumes, languages, writing systems, cuisines, traditional music and so on.\n\n-->\nHowever, as Chinese writing concepts were passed on to Korea, Japan and Vietnam, these nations developed their own characteristic writing systems to complement Hanzi. Vietnam invented their own [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]] glyphs, Japan invented [[kana]], and Korea invented their own alphabet [[hangul]]. To this day, Vietnam mostly writes in [[Vietnamese alphabet|quoc ngu]] (a modified Latin alphabet) but there is also a resurgence of Hanzi (or [[History of writing in Vietnam|chu han]]) as well. Sino cognates compose a vast majority of the vocabulary of these languages (see [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]], [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]). In the 20th century, China has also re-borrowed terms from Japan to represent western concepts known as ''[[Wasei-kango]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/pubs/Japanloans_rev.pdf  | title= Some Returned Loans: Japanese Loanwords in Taiwan Mandarin | publisher= National Taiwan University |author=Karen Steffen Chung  |date= | accessdate=April 21, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nApart from the unifying influence of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Chinese characters]] and numerous other [[Culture of China|Chinese cultural influences]], East Asian national customs, architecture, literature, cuisines, traditional music, performing arts and crafts also have developed from many independent and local concepts, they have grown and diversified as many rank among the most refined expressions of aesthetic, artistic and philosophical ideas in the world.

The term [[Greater India|''Indianised Kingdoms'']] is a designation for numerous Southeast Asian political units, that had to a varying degree adopted most aspects of India's statecraft, administration, art, epigraphy, writing and architecture. The religions [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] gradually diffused into local cosmology. Nonetheless, the Southeast Asian nations have very diversely adapted to these cultural stimuli and evolved their distinct sophisticated expression in lifestyle, the visual arts and most notably in architectural accomplishments, such as [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia and [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>National Library of Australia.

In the case of Vietnam, it is also influenced much by [[Confucianism]] and the culture of China. [[Myanmar]] has also been exposed to Indian cultural influences. Before the 14th century, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were the dominant religions of Southeast Asia. Thereafter, Islam became dominant in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Southeast Asia has also had a lot of [[Western culture|Western]] influence due to the lasting legacy of [[colonialism]]. One example is the Philippines which has been heavily influenced by the United States and Spain, with Christianity ([[Catholicism]]) as the dominant religion. [[East Timor]] also demonstrates [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] influence through colonialism, as is also a predominantly Christian nation.\n\nA common feature found around the region are [[stilt house]]s. These houses are elevated on stilts so that water can easily pass below them in case of a flood. Another shared feature is [[rice paddy]] agriculture, which originated in Southeast Asia thousands of years ago. Dance drama is also a very important feature of the culture, utilizing movements of the hands and feet perfected over thousands of years.

He also wrote [[Jana Gana Mana]] the national anthem of India as well as [[Amar Sonar Bangla]] the [[national anthem]] of [[Bangladesh]].  Moreover, translation of his another song \u201cNamo Namo Matha\" is the national anthem of Sri Lanka. This song  was collected by his student Mr. Ananda Samarakoon and  M. Nallathamby translated in Tamil language. Other Asian writers won Nobel Prizes in literature, including [[Yasunari Kawabata]] (Japan, 1966), and [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] (Japan, 1994). [[Yasunari Kawabata]] wrote novels and short stories distinguished by their elegant and spartan diction such as the novels [[Snow Country]] and [[The Master of Go]].\n\n== Family ==\nFamilies have very great importance in Asian cultures. They teach their kids that the family is their protection and the major source of their identity. They expect loyalty from their children. Parents define the law and the children are expected to obey them. This is called [[filial piety]], the respect for one's parents and elders, and it is a concept that originated in China as \u5b5d (xiao) with [[Confucianism|Confucian's]] teachings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2010/10/cultural-values-of-asian-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Asian Patients and Families \u2013 Dimensions of Culture|website=www.dimensionsofculture.com|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref>  They are expected to have self-control, thus making it hard for them to express emotions, they are also expected to show respect through their motions and the way they speak.

In Chinese culture, sometimes children are expected to care for their elders (\u8d61\u517b), and in various diaspora communities one may find Chinese children living with even their grandparents.\n\n== Philosophy ==\n{{Main|Eastern philosophy}}\n{{See also|Indian philosophy|Chinese philosophy|Islamic philosophy}}\nAsian philosophical traditions originated in India and China, and has been classified as [[Eastern philosophy]] covering a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings, including those popular within India and China. The [[Indian philosophy]] include [[Jain philosophy]], [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist]] philosophies. They include elements of non-material pursuits, whereas another school of thought [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]], which originated in India, and was propounded by [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka|Charvak]] around 2500 years before, preached the enjoyment of material world. Middle Eastern philosophy includes [[Islamic philosophy]] as well as [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Persian philosophy]].\n\nDuring the 20th century, in the two most populous countries of Asia, two dramatically different political philosophies took shape. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] gave a new meaning to [[Ahimsa]], and redefined the concepts of [[nonviolence]] and [[nonresistance]]. During the same period, [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communism|communist]] [[Maoism|philosophy]] was crystallized.\n\n== Religions ==\n{{Main|Religion in Asia}}\n[[File:Lightmatter buddha3.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone image of the [[Gautam Buddha|Buddha]]]]\n[[File:\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0642\u0639 \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a \u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0641\u062c\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633 25-9-2014.jpg|thumb|The [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] [[Saint Ahoadamah Church, Tikrit|Saint Ahoadamah Church]] was a 7th-century church building in the city of [[Tikrit]], one of the oldest in the world until its destruction by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] on 25 September 2014.]]\n[[File:Palestine-2013(2)-Jerusalem-Temple Mount-Dome of the Rock (SE exposure).jpg|thumb|[[Dome of the Rock]], an Islamic shrine in [[Jerusalem]].]]\nAsia is the birthplace of many religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Confucianism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zoroastranism]].

In China, [[Chinese New Year]], [[Dragon Boat Festival]], and [[Mid-Autumn Moon Festival]] are traditional holidays, while [[National Day]] is a holiday of the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn [[Japan]], [[Japanese New Year]], [[National Foundation Day]], [[Children's Day]], [[O-bon]], [[The Emperor's Birthday]] and [[Christmas worldwide#Japan|Christmas]] are popular. According to Japanese [[syncretism]], most Japanese celebrate [[Buddhism]]'s O-bon in midsummer, [[Shinto]]'s [[Shichi-Go-San]] in November, and Christmas and [[Hatsumoude]] in winter together.\n\nIn [[India]], [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] and [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] are important national festivals celebrated by people irrespective of faith. Major [[Hindu]] festivals of India include [[Diwali]], [[Vijayadashami|Dussehra or Daserra]], [[Holi]], [[Makar Sankranti]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]], [[Mahashivratri]], [[Ugadi]], [[Navratri]], [[Ramanavami]], [[Baisakhi]], [[Onam]], [[Rathayatra]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and [[Krishna Janmaashtami]]. Islamic festivals such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]], Sikh festivals such as [[Vaisakhi]], and Christian festivals such as Christmas, are also celebrated in India.\n\nThe [[Philippines]] is also tagged as the \"Fiesta Country\" because of its all-year-round celebrations nationwide. There is a very strong Spanish influence in their festivals, thus making the Philippines distinctively \"Western\", yet retaining its native Asian characteristics. Fiesta is the term used to refer to a [[festival]]. Most of these fiestas are celebrated in honor of a patron saint. To summarize it all, at least every city or municipality has a fiesta. Some prime examples include [[Sinulog]] from [[Cebu]] and [[Dinagyang]] of [[Iloilo]]. Other famous Philippine festivals include the [[MassKara Festival]] of [[Bacolod]] and [[Panagbenga Festival]] of [[Baguio]].\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[Independence Day (Indonesia)|Independence Day]] and the birthday of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] are important. This [[Muslim]] majority country also celebrates Islamic celebrations and festivals, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Mawlid]], [[Islamic New Year]], [[Ashura]], [[Tabuik]], and [[Tasyrik day]].\n\n== Sports ==\n{{Main|Sports in Asia}}\n\nDue to the vastness of Asia, popularity of sports varies greatly across the continent.\n\n[[Association football]] is widely popular in Asia. [[Boxing]], [[badminton]], and [[table tennis]] are very popular in East Asia. [[Baseball]] is popular in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. [[Cricket]] is especially popular in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka; and more recently, in Nepal and Afghanistan.\n\n== Cuisine ==\n[[File:Bali cuisine.jpg|thumb|[[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] [[Balinese cuisine]]]]\nIn many parts of Asia, [[rice]] is a staple food, and it is mostly served [[steam]]ed or as a [[porridge]] known as [[congee]]. China is the world largest producer and consumer of rice. While grain flatbread were consumed in the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nTraditionally, many Asians eat using their bare hand; this is a common practice in Central, South, and West Asia. However, western cutlery such as spoons and forks are currently being used increasingly and have also become widely available. With the advent of western cutlery, it may be viewed as rude in these nations to eat using the bare hands in some public places. In Indonesia and the Philippines, people usually use western cutlery such as the spoon, fork, and knife. While in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam, people usually use [[chopsticks]] to eat traditional food, but the shape of chopsticks are different in these countries. For example, Chinese chopsticks are long and square; Vietnamese chopsticks are long, being thick at one end and then gradually getting thinner at the other end, and are made of wood or bamboo; Japanese chopsticks are rounder, short, and spiral, having been designed to eat bony fish easily; Taiwanese chopsticks are made of materials such as [[bamboo]], wood, and metal; Korean chopsticks are short, flat, and made of metal. It is said that wood is rarer than metal on the Korean Peninsula{{Citation needed |date=February 2013}} and that metal chopsticks can prevent poisoning. Fresh raw fish cuisines, such as [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]] are very popular in East Asia (especially Japan). These raw fish dishes were influenced by two major cultures: Chinese and Japanese.\n\nIn India, people often eat food with their hands, and many [[spice]]s such as [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], and [[fennel seeds]] are used in every dish. Most spices originated within the Indian subcontinent. [[Durian]]s are a common fruit in [[Southeast Asia]], which, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], attested to its delicious flavor as worth the entire cost of his trip there.\n\nThe [[cuisine of Indonesia]] possess rich and diverse collection of dishes and recipes with regional cooking tradition flourished, such as [[Padang food|Minang]] [[Sundanese cuisine|Sundanese]] to [[Balinese cuisine|Balinese]]. Most Indonesians consume steamed rice with flavorful meat, fish, and vegetables in one serving such as in [[Nasi Padang]] and [[nasi campur]]. Other notable example include [[rendang]], [[satay]], [[soto (food)|soto]], and [[nasi goreng]].\n\nIn [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino banquet]], many unique dishes have arisen because of the country's long years of colonization and interactions with other neighboring cultures and nations; it has inherited Latin, Malay, Chinese, and American influences to its people's local blend.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604051405/http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=4 June 2007 | title= The Flavors of Asia   |author=    |publisher= Quaker Oats Company |date=   | accessdate=April 30, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Tandoorimumbai.jpg|[[Chicken tikka]], a well-known dish across the globe, reflects the amalgamation of South Asian cooking styles with those from [[Central Asia]].\nFile:Philippine Food.jpg|[[Philippine cuisine]]\nFile:Kabsa.jpg|[[Kabsa]] also called Majboos, famous in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], [[Bahrain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Culture by people ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Afghan people]]\n* [[Arab people]]\n* [[Armenian people]]\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Aryan]]\n* [[Azerbaijani people]]\n* [[Baloch people]]\n* [[Bangladeshi people]]\n* [[Bengali people]]\n* [[Betawi people]]\n* [[Buginese people]]\n* [[Bamar|Burmese people]]\n* [[Culture of China|Chinese people]]\n* [[Cambodian people]]\n* [[Dravidian people]]\n* [[Filipino people]]\n* [[Hadhrami people]]\n* [[Hmong people]]\n* [[Hong Kong people]]\n* [[Iranian people]]\n* [[Indonesians|Indonesian people]]\n* [[Israelis|Israeli people]]\n* [[Japanese people]]\n* [[Jewish people]]\n* [[Korean people]]\n* [[Kurdish people]]\n* [[Lao people]]\n* [[Macanese people]]\n* [[Ethnic Malay|Malay people]]\n* [[Malaysians|Malaysian people]]\n* [[Miao people]]\n* [[Minangkabau people]]\n* [[Mongolian people]]\n* [[Moro people]]\n* [[Punjabi people]]\n* [[Pakistani people]]\n* [[Pashto people|Pashtun People]]\n* [[Peranakan people]]\n* [[Tibetan people]]\n* [[Rohingya people]]\n* [[Romani people]]\n* [[Russian people]]\n* [[Sindhi people]]\n* [[Tajik people]]\n* [[Turkic peoples]]\n* [[Taiwanese people]]\n* [[Thai people]]\n* [[Vietnamese people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Asia|Society}}\n* [[Culture of Africa]]\n* [[Culture of Europe]]\n* [[Culture of North America]]\n* [[Culture of Oceania]]\n* [[Culture of South America]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Note|TreasuryOfBotanyVol1}} John Lindley (1889), ''Treasury of Botany'' vol 1. p.&nbsp;435.

The continent is commonly divided into geographic and cultural [[subregion]]s, including [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[West Asia]]. While linked together on a geographical continent, there has been little unity or common history between the many cultures and peoples there. [[Asian art]], [[Asian music|music]], and [[Asian cuisine|cuisine]], as well as [[Asian literature|literature]] are all important parts of Asian culture. [[Eastern philosophy]] and religion, including [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], also play major roles. One of the most complex parts of modern Asian culture is the [[East\u2013West dichotomy]], as increasing Western influence clashes with traditional ideals.\n\n== Nationalities and ethnic groups ==\nThere is an abundance of ethnic and racial groups throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia. Some groups are primarily [[hunter-gatherer]]s, some practice [[transhumance]] (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others are becoming industrial/urban. Some nationalities are completely urban, like in [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Colonial rule in Asia largely died out by the late 20th century due to national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.-->\n\n== Multiple cultural centers ==\nAsia's various modern cultural and religious spheres correspond roughly with the principal centers of civilization.\n\nWest Asia (or Southwest Asia as [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morrison]] puts it, or sometimes referred to as the [[Middle East]]) has their cultural roots in the pioneering civilizations of the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Mesopotamia]], spawning the [[Iran|Persian]], [[Arab world|Arab]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of [[Judaism]] and later [[Islam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Mesopotamia|author=Dominique Collon |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref> According to Morrison, in his book ''Why the West Rules--For Now,'' these original civilizations of the [[Hilly flanks|Hilly Flanks]] are so far (by archaeological evidence) the oldest (first evidence of farming c9000 BC).

This is because [[Classical Chinese]] was long the written language of all China, and was replaced by [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as the national written language in the twentieth century.  Chinese writing was passed to [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]] in the post-classical era. In Japan, the set of Chinese characters used are called [[Kanji]] and form a major component of the Japanese writing system.   In the 9th century, the Japanese developed their own writing system called [[Kana]] ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) which support Kanji, thus establishing the Japanese language. Today, both [[ideograph]] Kanji and [[syllabary]] Kana is used in mixture in Japanese. In Vietnam, Chinese script (Han Tu) was used during the millennium under the influence of China, with the vernacular [[Chu Nom]] script are also used since the 13th century. However, this has now (since the early 20th century) been replaced completely by the Latin Alphabet-based [[Quoc Ngu]]. In the 15th century, Korea developed an alphabet system called Hangul to make writing and communication easier for its commoners.\n\nThough Korea, Japan and Vietnam are not Chinese speaking regions, their languages have been influenced by the Chinese greatly. However, most of these languages are different enough from Chinese to be considered parts of different language families, such as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], an [[Austro-Asiatic language]]; [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a [[Japonic language]]; and Korean, a [[Koreanic language]]; all differing from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a [[Sino-Tibetan language]]. Even though their writing systems have changed over time, Chinese is still found in the historical roots of many borrowed words. In modern times, Chinese is also influenced by other Asian languages, such as by modern technical and political terms created in Japan to represent western concepts. For example, \u6587\u5316 (culture), \u6587\u660e (civilization), \u4eba\u6c11 (people), \u7d4c\u6e08 (economy), \u5171\u548c (republic) and \u54f2\u5b66 (philosophy) are borrowed words from Japanese to Chinese, known as ''[[wasei-kango]]''. Apart from the unifying influence of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Chinese characters]], and other [[Culture of China|Chinese Cultural Influences]],\n\nthere is nevertheless much diversity between the countries of the region such as different religions, national costumes, languages, writing systems, cuisines, traditional music and so on.\n\n-->\nHowever, as Chinese writing concepts were passed on to Korea, Japan and Vietnam, these nations developed their own characteristic writing systems to complement Hanzi. Vietnam invented their own [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]] glyphs, Japan invented [[kana]], and Korea invented their own alphabet [[hangul]]. To this day, Vietnam mostly writes in [[Vietnamese alphabet|quoc ngu]] (a modified Latin alphabet) but there is also a resurgence of Hanzi (or [[History of writing in Vietnam|chu han]]) as well. Sino cognates compose a vast majority of the vocabulary of these languages (see [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]], [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]). In the 20th century, China has also re-borrowed terms from Japan to represent western concepts known as ''[[Wasei-kango]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/pubs/Japanloans_rev.pdf  | title= Some Returned Loans: Japanese Loanwords in Taiwan Mandarin | publisher= National Taiwan University |author=Karen Steffen Chung  |date= | accessdate=April 21, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nApart from the unifying influence of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Chinese characters]] and numerous other [[Culture of China|Chinese cultural influences]], East Asian national customs, architecture, literature, cuisines, traditional music, performing arts and crafts also have developed from many independent and local concepts, they have grown and diversified as many rank among the most refined expressions of aesthetic, artistic and philosophical ideas in the world.

The religions [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] gradually diffused into local cosmology.

In the case of Vietnam, it is also influenced much by [[Confucianism]] and the culture of China. [[Myanmar]] has also been exposed to Indian cultural influences. Before the 14th century, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were the dominant religions of Southeast Asia. Thereafter, Islam became dominant in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Southeast Asia has also had a lot of [[Western culture|Western]] influence due to the lasting legacy of [[colonialism]]. One example is the Philippines which has been heavily influenced by the United States and Spain, with Christianity ([[Catholicism]]) as the dominant religion. [[East Timor]] also demonstrates [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] influence through colonialism, as is also a predominantly Christian nation.\n\nA common feature found around the region are [[stilt house]]s. These houses are elevated on stilts so that water can easily pass below them in case of a flood. Another shared feature is [[rice paddy]] agriculture, which originated in Southeast Asia thousands of years ago. Dance drama is also a very important feature of the culture, utilizing movements of the hands and feet perfected over thousands of years.

Some of the best known styles of martial arts in the world were developed in East Asia, such as [[karate]] and [[judo]] from Japan, [[taekwondo]] from Korea and the various styles of [[Chinese martial arts]] known collectively as kung fu. Many other styles of martial arts originated in Southeast Asia, including [[muay Thai]] from Thailand, [[Vovinam]] from Vietnam, [[Arnis]] from the Philippines, and [[Pencak Silat]] from Indonesia. In addition, popular styles of [[wrestling]] have originated in [[Oil wrestling|Turkey]] and [[Mongolian wrestling|Mongolia]].\n\nDevelopment of Asian martial arts continues today as newer styles are created. Modern [[hybrid martial arts]] systems such as [[Jeet Kune Do]] and [[Krav Maga]] often incorporate techniques from traditional East Asian martial arts.

A sizable amount of it is written in the [[Hebrew language]], although there have been cases of literature written in Hebrew by [[non-Jews]].<ref>''Modern Palestinian literature and culture'', by Ami Elad, 37ff</ref> Without doubt, the most important such work is the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]). Many other ancient works of Hebrew literature survive, including religious and philosophical works, historical records, and works of fiction.\n\n=== Indian ===\n{{Main|Indian literature}}\nThe famous poet and playwright [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa]] wrote two epics: Raghuvamsham (Dynasty of Raghu) and Kumarasambhavam (Birth of Kumar Kartikeya); they were written in Classical [[Sanskrit]] rather than Epic Sanskrit some other examples of his plays are Abhigyanam Shakuntala . Other examples of works written in Classical Sanskrit include the P\u0101nini's Ashtadhyayi which standardized the grammar and phonetics of Classical Sanskrit. The Laws of Manu is an important text in Hinduism. K\u0101lid\u0101sa is often considered to be the greatest playwright in Sanskrit literature, and one of the greatest poets in Sanskrit literature, whose Recognition of Shakuntala and Meghaduuta are the most famous Sanskrit plays. He occupies the same position in Sanskrit literature that Shakespeare occupies in English literature. Some other famous plays were Mricchakatika by Shudraka, Svapna Vasavadattam by Bhasa, and Ratnavali by Sri Harsha. Later poetic works include Geeta Govinda by Jayadeva. Some other famous works are [[Chanakya|Chanakya's]] and Vatsyayana's [[Kama Sutra|Kamasutra]].\n\n=== Japanese ===\n{{Main|Japanese literature}}\nIn the early eleventh century, court lady [[Murasaki Shikibu]] wrote [[Tale of the Genji]] considered the masterpiece of Japanese literatures and an early example of a work of fiction in the form of a [[novel]].\n[[Japanese literature#Early-modern literature|Early-Modern Japanese literature]] (17th\u201319th centuries) developed comparable innovations such as [[haiku]], a form of [[Japanese poetry]] that evolved from the ancient ''[[hokku]]'' ([[Japanese language]]: \u767a\u53e5) mode. Haiku consists of three lines: the first and third lines each have five ''morae'' (the rough [[phonology|phonological]] equivalent of [[syllable]]s), while the second has seven. Original haiku masters included such figures as [[Edo period]] poet [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (\u677e\u5c3e\u82ad\u8549); others influenced by Bash\u014d include [[Kobayashi Issa]] and [[Masaoka Shiki]].\n\n=== Korean ===\n{{Main|Korean literature}}\nKorean literature begins in the Three Kingdoms Period, and continues through the [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] dynasties to the modern day. Examples of Korean poetric forms include [[sijo]] and [[gasa (poetry)|gasa]], with [[Jeong Cheol]] and [[Yun Seon-do]] considered to be the supreme Korean poets.

He also wrote [[Jana Gana Mana]] the national anthem of India as well as [[Amar Sonar Bangla]] the [[national anthem]] of [[Bangladesh]].  Moreover, translation of his another song \u201cNamo Namo Matha\" is the national anthem of Sri Lanka. This song  was collected by his student Mr. Ananda Samarakoon and  M. Nallathamby translated in Tamil language. Other Asian writers won Nobel Prizes in literature, including [[Yasunari Kawabata]] (Japan, 1966), and [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] (Japan, 1994). [[Yasunari Kawabata]] wrote novels and short stories distinguished by their elegant and spartan diction such as the novels [[Snow Country]] and [[The Master of Go]].\n\n== Family ==\nFamilies have very great importance in Asian cultures. They teach their kids that the family is their protection and the major source of their identity. They expect loyalty from their children. Parents define the law and the children are expected to obey them. This is called [[filial piety]], the respect for one's parents and elders, and it is a concept that originated in China as \u5b5d (xiao) with [[Confucianism|Confucian's]] teachings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2010/10/cultural-values-of-asian-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Asian Patients and Families \u2013 Dimensions of Culture|website=www.dimensionsofculture.com|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref>  They are expected to have self-control, thus making it hard for them to express emotions, they are also expected to show respect through their motions and the way they speak.

In Chinese culture, sometimes children are expected to care for their elders (\u8d61\u517b), and in various diaspora communities one may find Chinese children living with even their grandparents.\n\n== Philosophy ==\n{{Main|Eastern philosophy}}\n{{See also|Indian philosophy|Chinese philosophy|Islamic philosophy}}\nAsian philosophical traditions originated in India and China, and has been classified as [[Eastern philosophy]] covering a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings, including those popular within India and China. The [[Indian philosophy]] include [[Jain philosophy]], [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist]] philosophies. They include elements of non-material pursuits, whereas another school of thought [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]], which originated in India, and was propounded by [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka|Charvak]] around 2500 years before, preached the enjoyment of material world. Middle Eastern philosophy includes [[Islamic philosophy]] as well as [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Persian philosophy]].\n\nDuring the 20th century, in the two most populous countries of Asia, two dramatically different political philosophies took shape. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] gave a new meaning to [[Ahimsa]], and redefined the concepts of [[nonviolence]] and [[nonresistance]]. During the same period, [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communism|communist]] [[Maoism|philosophy]] was crystallized.\n\n== Religions ==\n{{Main|Religion in Asia}}\n[[File:Lightmatter buddha3.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone image of the [[Gautam Buddha|Buddha]]]]\n[[File:\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0642\u0639 \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a \u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0641\u062c\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633 25-9-2014.jpg|thumb|The [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] [[Saint Ahoadamah Church, Tikrit|Saint Ahoadamah Church]] was a 7th-century church building in the city of [[Tikrit]], one of the oldest in the world until its destruction by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] on 25 September 2014.]]\n[[File:Palestine-2013(2)-Jerusalem-Temple Mount-Dome of the Rock (SE exposure).jpg|thumb|[[Dome of the Rock]], an Islamic shrine in [[Jerusalem]].]]\nAsia is the birthplace of many religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Confucianism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zoroastranism]].

In China, [[Chinese New Year]], [[Dragon Boat Festival]], and [[Mid-Autumn Moon Festival]] are traditional holidays, while [[National Day]] is a holiday of the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn [[Japan]], [[Japanese New Year]], [[National Foundation Day]], [[Children's Day]], [[O-bon]], [[The Emperor's Birthday]] and [[Christmas worldwide#Japan|Christmas]] are popular. According to Japanese [[syncretism]], most Japanese celebrate [[Buddhism]]'s O-bon in midsummer, [[Shinto]]'s [[Shichi-Go-San]] in November, and Christmas and [[Hatsumoude]] in winter together.\n\nIn [[India]], [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] and [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] are important national festivals celebrated by people irrespective of faith. Major [[Hindu]] festivals of India include [[Diwali]], [[Vijayadashami|Dussehra or Daserra]], [[Holi]], [[Makar Sankranti]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]], [[Mahashivratri]], [[Ugadi]], [[Navratri]], [[Ramanavami]], [[Baisakhi]], [[Onam]], [[Rathayatra]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and [[Krishna Janmaashtami]]. Islamic festivals such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]], Sikh festivals such as [[Vaisakhi]], and Christian festivals such as Christmas, are also celebrated in India.\n\nThe [[Philippines]] is also tagged as the \"Fiesta Country\" because of its all-year-round celebrations nationwide. There is a very strong Spanish influence in their festivals, thus making the Philippines distinctively \"Western\", yet retaining its native Asian characteristics. Fiesta is the term used to refer to a [[festival]]. Most of these fiestas are celebrated in honor of a patron saint. To summarize it all, at least every city or municipality has a fiesta. Some prime examples include [[Sinulog]] from [[Cebu]] and [[Dinagyang]] of [[Iloilo]]. Other famous Philippine festivals include the [[MassKara Festival]] of [[Bacolod]] and [[Panagbenga Festival]] of [[Baguio]].\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[Independence Day (Indonesia)|Independence Day]] and the birthday of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] are important. This [[Muslim]] majority country also celebrates Islamic celebrations and festivals, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Mawlid]], [[Islamic New Year]], [[Ashura]], [[Tabuik]], and [[Tasyrik day]].\n\n== Sports ==\n{{Main|Sports in Asia}}\n\nDue to the vastness of Asia, popularity of sports varies greatly across the continent.\n\n[[Association football]] is widely popular in Asia. [[Boxing]], [[badminton]], and [[table tennis]] are very popular in East Asia. [[Baseball]] is popular in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. [[Cricket]] is especially popular in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka; and more recently, in Nepal and Afghanistan.\n\n== Cuisine ==\n[[File:Bali cuisine.jpg|thumb|[[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] [[Balinese cuisine]]]]\nIn many parts of Asia, [[rice]] is a staple food, and it is mostly served [[steam]]ed or as a [[porridge]] known as [[congee]]. China is the world largest producer and consumer of rice. While grain flatbread were consumed in the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nTraditionally, many Asians eat using their bare hand; this is a common practice in Central, South, and West Asia. However, western cutlery such as spoons and forks are currently being used increasingly and have also become widely available. With the advent of western cutlery, it may be viewed as rude in these nations to eat using the bare hands in some public places. In Indonesia and the Philippines, people usually use western cutlery such as the spoon, fork, and knife. While in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam, people usually use [[chopsticks]] to eat traditional food, but the shape of chopsticks are different in these countries. For example, Chinese chopsticks are long and square; Vietnamese chopsticks are long, being thick at one end and then gradually getting thinner at the other end, and are made of wood or bamboo; Japanese chopsticks are rounder, short, and spiral, having been designed to eat bony fish easily; Taiwanese chopsticks are made of materials such as [[bamboo]], wood, and metal; Korean chopsticks are short, flat, and made of metal. It is said that wood is rarer than metal on the Korean Peninsula{{Citation needed |date=February 2013}} and that metal chopsticks can prevent poisoning. Fresh raw fish cuisines, such as [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]] are very popular in East Asia (especially Japan). These raw fish dishes were influenced by two major cultures: Chinese and Japanese.\n\nIn India, people often eat food with their hands, and many [[spice]]s such as [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], and [[fennel seeds]] are used in every dish. Most spices originated within the Indian subcontinent. [[Durian]]s are a common fruit in [[Southeast Asia]], which, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], attested to its delicious flavor as worth the entire cost of his trip there.\n\nThe [[cuisine of Indonesia]] possess rich and diverse collection of dishes and recipes with regional cooking tradition flourished, such as [[Padang food|Minang]] [[Sundanese cuisine|Sundanese]] to [[Balinese cuisine|Balinese]]. Most Indonesians consume steamed rice with flavorful meat, fish, and vegetables in one serving such as in [[Nasi Padang]] and [[nasi campur]]. Other notable example include [[rendang]], [[satay]], [[soto (food)|soto]], and [[nasi goreng]].\n\nIn [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino banquet]], many unique dishes have arisen because of the country's long years of colonization and interactions with other neighboring cultures and nations; it has inherited Latin, Malay, Chinese, and American influences to its people's local blend.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604051405/http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=4 June 2007 | title= The Flavors of Asia   |author=    |publisher= Quaker Oats Company |date=   | accessdate=April 30, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Tandoorimumbai.jpg|[[Chicken tikka]], a well-known dish across the globe, reflects the amalgamation of South Asian cooking styles with those from [[Central Asia]].\nFile:Philippine Food.jpg|[[Philippine cuisine]]\nFile:Kabsa.jpg|[[Kabsa]] also called Majboos, famous in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], [[Bahrain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Culture by people ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Afghan people]]\n* [[Arab people]]\n* [[Armenian people]]\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Aryan]]\n* [[Azerbaijani people]]\n* [[Baloch people]]\n* [[Bangladeshi people]]\n* [[Bengali people]]\n* [[Betawi people]]\n* [[Buginese people]]\n* [[Bamar|Burmese people]]\n* [[Culture of China|Chinese people]]\n* [[Cambodian people]]\n* [[Dravidian people]]\n* [[Filipino people]]\n* [[Hadhrami people]]\n* [[Hmong people]]\n* [[Hong Kong people]]\n* [[Iranian people]]\n* [[Indonesians|Indonesian people]]\n* [[Israelis|Israeli people]]\n* [[Japanese people]]\n* [[Jewish people]]\n* [[Korean people]]\n* [[Kurdish people]]\n* [[Lao people]]\n* [[Macanese people]]\n* [[Ethnic Malay|Malay people]]\n* [[Malaysians|Malaysian people]]\n* [[Miao people]]\n* [[Minangkabau people]]\n* [[Mongolian people]]\n* [[Moro people]]\n* [[Punjabi people]]\n* [[Pakistani people]]\n* [[Pashto people|Pashtun People]]\n* [[Peranakan people]]\n* [[Tibetan people]]\n* [[Rohingya people]]\n* [[Romani people]]\n* [[Russian people]]\n* [[Sindhi people]]\n* [[Tajik people]]\n* [[Turkic peoples]]\n* [[Taiwanese people]]\n* [[Thai people]]\n* [[Vietnamese people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Asia|Society}}\n* [[Culture of Africa]]\n* [[Culture of Europe]]\n* [[Culture of North America]]\n* [[Culture of Oceania]]\n* [[Culture of South America]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Note|TreasuryOfBotanyVol1}} John Lindley (1889), ''Treasury of Botany'' vol 1. p.&nbsp;435.
