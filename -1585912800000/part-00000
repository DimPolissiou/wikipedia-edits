He was the son of [[Philip of Ibelin (1180\u20131227)|Philip of Ibelin]], [[bailli]] of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]], and Alice of Montb\u00e9liard, and was the nephew of [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin, the \"Old Lord of Beirut\"]]. To distinguish him from his uncle and other members of the [[Ibelin family]] named John, he is sometimes called '''John of Jaffa'''.\n\n==Family and early life==\nHis family was the first branch of Ibelins to have their seat in Cyprus, due to his father's regency there 1218-1227.<ref>Edbury, Peter W. ''John of Ibelin and the Kingdom of Jerusalem'' (Boydell Press, 1997), pg. 34.</ref> In 1229 John fled [[Cyprus]] with his family when [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] seized the Ibelin territories on the island. They settled temporarily in northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where the family had holdings. He was present at the [[Battle of Casal Imbert]] in 1232, when his uncle John of Beirut defeated [[Riccardo Filangieri]], Frederick's lieutenant in the east. Around 1240 he married Maria of Barbaron (d. 1263), the sister of [[Hethum I of Armenia]] and sister-in-law of King [[Henry I of Cyprus]].<ref>Edbury, pp. 66-67.</ref> In 1241 he was probably responsible for drafting a compromise between the Ibelins and the emperor, in which [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]] would govern the kingdom. This proposal was never implemented and Simon never came to the Holy Land; the Ibelins continued to quarrel with the representatives of the [[Hohenstaufen]]s, and in 1242 they captured [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] from their rivals. John participated in the siege.<ref>Edbury, pp. 67-69.</ref>\n\n==Participation in the Crusades==\n[[File:SempadLetter.JPG|right|thumb|Letter from [[Sempad the Constable]] to John of Ibelin, his brother-in-law]]\nShortly thereafter, sometime between 1246 and the beginning of the [[Seventh Crusade]], John became count of [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]] and [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and [[lord of Ramla]]. [[Ramla]] was an old holding of the Ibelins, but Jaffa and Ascalon had belonged to others, most recently to the murdered [[Walter IV of Brienne]], whose son [[John, Count of Brienne]] (king Henry's nephew) was supplanted by this Ibelin acquisition. This probably occurred when king Henry, John's first cousin, became regent of Jerusalem, and distributed continental lands to his Cypriot barons to create a loyal base there. Jaffa was by now a minor port and Ascalon was captured from the [[Knights Hospitaller]] by the [[Mamluk]]s in 1247.<ref>Edbury, pp. 79-81.</ref>\n\nIn 1249 John joined the Seventh Crusade and participated in [[Louis IX of France]]'s capture of [[Damietta]]. Louis was taken prisoner when Damietta was recaptured, but John seems to have escaped the same fate. Louis was released in 1252 and moved his army to Jaffa. Louis' constable and chronicler [[Jean de Joinville]] portrays John very favourably; he describes John's coat-of-arms as \"a fine thing to see...''or'' with a cross ''pate\u00e9 gules''\".<ref>''Joinvile and Villehardouin: Chronicles of the Crusades'', trans. Caroline Smith (Penguin, 2009), pg. 276.</ref> John was by now an extremely famous lord in the east, corresponding also with [[Henry III of England]] and [[Pope Innocent IV]], who had confirmed Henry I's grant to John.<ref>Edbury, pp. 84-85.</ref>\n\nHenry I died in 1253, and Louis IX left for France in 1254, leaving John as bailli of Jerusalem. John made peace with [[Damascus]] and used the forces of Jerusalem to attack Ascalon; the Egyptians besieged Jaffa in 1256 in response. John marched out and defeated them, and after this victory he gave up the [[bailliage]] to his cousin John of Arsuf.<ref>Edbury, pp. 90-91.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] trading communities in [[Akko|Acre]] came into conflict, in the \"[[War of Saint Sabas]].\" John supported the Venetians. In order to bring some order back to the kingdom, John and [[Bohemund VI of Antioch]] summoned Dowager Queen [[Plaisance of Cyprus]] to take over the regency of the kingdom for the absentee king, [[Conradin]]. Nevertheless, the Venetians defeated the Genoese in a naval battle in 1258 and the Genoese left Acre. With Plaisance and Hugh in Acre, the Ibelin family began to decline in importance, but around 1263 John began a scandalous affair with Plaisance, possibly prompting [[Pope Urban IV]] to send an official letter in protest, ''[[De sinu patris]]''.<ref>Edbury, pp. 92-96.</ref> John's wife and children were believed to have been living apart from him at the time.  Maria was visiting her family in Cilicia in 1256 and 1263, and died after visiting her father, [[Constantine of Baberon]], on his own deathbed.\n\nJohn could do little while [[Baibars]], the Mamluk [[sultan of Egypt]], fought with the [[Mongols]] in Palestine. Baibars may have reduced Jaffa to vassalage, and certainly used its port to transport food to Egypt.  John's truce with Baibars did not last, and he himself died in 1266. By 1268 Baibars had captured Jaffa.<ref>Edbury, pp. 97-98.</ref>\n\n==Treatise==\n{{See also|Assizes of Jerusalem}}\nFrom 1264 to 1266, John of Ibelin wrote an extensive legal treatise, now known as the ''Livre des Assises'', the longest such treatise known from the Levant, dealing with the so-called [[Assizes of Jerusalem]] and the procedure of the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' It also included details about the ecclesiastical and baronial structure of the Kingdom, as well as the number of knights owed to the crown by each of the kingdom's vassals.<ref>Edbury, pg. 106.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\nWith Maria of Armenia (sister of [[Hethum I, King of Armenia]] and daughter of [[Constantine of Baberon]]), John had the following children:\n* James (c. 1240&ndash; July 18, 1276), count of Jaffa and Ascalon 1266, married Marie of Montb\u00e9liard c. 1260\n* Philip (d. aft. 1263)\n* [[Guy of Ibelin (died 1304)|Guy]] (c. 1250&ndash;February 14, 1304), titular count of Jaffa and Ascalon 1276, married his cousin Marie, Lady of Naumachia c. 1290\n* John (d. aft. 1263)\n* Hethum\n* Oshin\n* Margaret (c. 1245&ndash; aft. 1317), Abbess of [[Notre Dame de Tyre]], Nicosia\n* Isabelle (c. 1250&ndash; aft. 1298), married Sempad of [[Servantikar]] c. 1270\n* Marie (d. aft. 1298), married firstly Vahran of Hamousse, secondly Gregorios Tardif October 10, 1298\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k110089k|last=Amadi|first=Francesco|title=Chroniques d'Amadi et de Strambaldi (publi\u00e9es par M.

Ukrainian First League''' was the first [[Ukrainian First League]] season with the record number of teams participating in the league at 28 divided into groups. The season started on March 14 and finished July 5, 1992.\n\nAt the end of the season the five worst teams from each of the two groups were relegated to the [[Ukrainian Second League]] (the third tier). The winners of each group qualified for the top league for the next season. Somewhat surprising was the performance of such teams as [[FC Karpaty Mukacheve|Pryladyst Mukacheve]] and [[FC Artania Ochakiv|Artania Ochakiv]] that were just a few points short of qualifying for the [[Ukrainian Premier League]].\n\n==Teams==\n\nIn the 1992 season, the Ukrainian First League consisted mostly of clubs that had competed in the Soviet Second League (Ukrainian Zone). The league was split into two groups A (mostly western and central Ukraine) and B (mostly eastern and southern Ukraine).\n\n===Map===\n{{Location map+|Ukraine|AlternativeMap = Ukraine (1991-2014)

He  was born and lived in [[Kafri]], [[Sassanid Asuristan|Sassanid Babylonia]]. He established at [[Sura (city)|Sura]] the systematic study of the [[rabbinic]] traditions, which, using the [[Mishnah]] as text, led to the compilation of the [[Talmud]]. With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia,<ref>{{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}</ref> around the year 220. In the [[Talmud]], he is frequently associated with [[Samuel of Nehardea]], with whom he debated many issues.\n\n==Biography==\nHis surname, '''Arikha''' (English, \"Long\"\u2014that is, \"Tall\"; it occurs only once\u2014''Hullin'' 137b), he owed to his height, which exceeded that of his contemporaries. Others, reading '''Arekha,''' consider it an honorary title, \"Lecturer\".<ref>Weiss, ''Dor,'' 3:147; Jastrow, ''Dictionary'' under the word</ref> In the traditional literature he is referred to almost exclusively as '''Rav''', \"the Master\", (both his contemporaries and posterity recognizing in him a master), just as his teacher, [[Judah HaNasi]], was known simply as ''Rabbi''. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the ''[[tannaitic]]'' literature,<ref>For instance, [[Tosefta]] ''Beitzah '' 1:7</ref> where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the ''Tannaim'' and the ''Amoraim'', and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an ''amora'', of disputing the opinion of a ''tanna''.<ref>''Bava Batra'' 42a and elsewhere</ref>\n\nRav was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to [[Shimei]], brother of [[King David]].<ref>''Sanhedrin'' 5a; ''Ketubot'' 62b</ref> His father, Aibo, was a brother of [[Hiyya the Great]] who lived in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch [[Judah haNasi]]. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncle's disciple and as a member of the academy at [[Sepphoris]], Rav acquired such knowledge of the tradition as to make him its foremost exponent in Babylonia. While Judah haNasi was still living, Rav, having been ordained as teacher (with certain restrictions<ref>''Sanhedrin'' 5a</ref>), returned to [[Babylonia]], where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism.\n\nIn the annals of the Babylonian schools, the year of his arrival is recorded as the starting-point in the chronology of the Talmudic age. It was the 530th year of the [[Seleucid]]an and the 219th year of the [[common era]]. As the scene of his activity, Rav first chose [[Nehardea]], where the [[exilarch]] appointed him ''[[agoranomos]]'', or market-master, and [[Rav Shela|Rabbi Shela]] made him lecturer (''amora'') of his college.<ref>''[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Bava Batra'' 5 15a; ''Yoma'' 20b</ref> Then he moved to [[Sura (city)|Sura]], on the [[Euphrates]], where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rav lived and worked in Sura until his death. [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]], another disciple of Judah haNasi, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rav that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Rav's activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.\n\nLittle is known of Rav's personal life. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture.<ref>''Hullin'' 105a</ref> He is referred to as the son of noblemen,<ref>Shabbat 29a</ref> but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. [[Rashi]] does tell us that he is being described as the son of great men. He was highly respected by the [[Gentile]]s as well as by the Jews of Babylonia, as shown by the friendship which existed between him and the last [[Parthia]]n king, [[Artabanus V (of Parthia)|Artaban]].<ref>''Avodah Zarah'' 10b</ref> He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of [[Ardashir I|Ardeshir]], founder of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty, although [[Samuel of Nehardea]] probably did so.\n\nRav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, [[Mar Ukba]] and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the Talmud, the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. Chiyya did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple [[Rav Huna]]. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of [[exilarch]].<ref>''Hullin'' 92a</ref>\n\nRav died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism.<ref>''Shabbat'' 110a, ''Mo'ed Katan'' 24a</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rav. That method takes the [[Mishnah]] of [[Judah haNasi]] as a text or foundation, adding to it the other ''tannaitic'' traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Rav's name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. His numerous disciples\u2014some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuel\u2014amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rav. In the Babylonian schools, Rav was rightly referred to as \"our great master.\" Rav also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of marriage and divorce, and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of ritual observance.\n\nRav, says tradition, found an open, neglected field and fenced it in.<ref>''Hullin'' 110a</ref>\n\n==Teachings==\nHe gave special attention to the [[liturgy]] of the [[synagogue]]. The [[Aleinu]] prayer first appeared in the manuscript of the [[Rosh Hashana]] liturgy by Rav. He included it in the Rosh Hashana [[mussaf]] service as a prologue to the Kingship portion of the [[Amidah]]. For that reason some attribute to Rav the authorship, or at least the revising, of Aleinu.<ref>Jacobson, B.S., ''The Weekday Siddur: An Exposition and Analysis of its Structure, Contents, Language and Ideas'' (2nd ed, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 307; Nulman, Macy, ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) page 24.</ref> In this noble prayer are evinced profound religious feeling and exalted thought, as well as ability to use the [[Hebrew language]] in a natural, expressive, and classical manner.<ref>''Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah'' 1 57a</ref>\n\nThe many [[homiletic]] and [[ethical]] sayings recorded of him show similar ability. The greatest aggadist among Babylonian ''[[Amoraim]]'', he is the only one of them whose aggadic utterances approach in number and contents those of the Palestinian haggadists. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] has preserved a large number of his [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggadah|aggadic]] utterances; and the Palestinian ''[[Midrashim]]'' also contain many of his ''aggadot''. Rav delivered homiletic discourses, both in the [[beit midrash]] and in the synagogues. He especially loved to discuss in his homilies the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the [[aggadah]], are his creations. His ''aggadah'' is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these teachings may be quoted here:\n* \"The commandments of the [[Torah]] were only given to purify men's morals\"<ref>[[Genesis Rabbah]] 44</ref>\n* \"Whatever may not properly be done in public is forbidden even in the most secret chamber\"<ref>''Shabbat'' 64b</ref>\n* \"In the future, a person will give a judgement and accounting over everything that his eye saw and he did not eat.\"<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], Kiddushin 4:12</ref>\n* \"Whoever lacks pity for his fellow man is no child of [[Abraham]]\"<ref>''Beitzah'' 32b</ref>\n* \"Better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace than to publicly shame one's fellow man.\"<ref>''Bava Metzia'' 59a</ref>\n* \"One should never betroth himself to a woman without having seen her; one might subsequently discover in her a blemish because of which one might loathe her and thus transgress the commandment: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'\"<ref>''Kiddushin'' 41a</ref>\n* \"A father should never prefer one child above another; the example of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] shows what evil consequences may result.\"\n* \"While the dates are still in the borders of your skirt, run off with them to the distillery!\" [Meaning, before one wastes what he has, let him convert it into something more productive]<ref>''Pesachim'' 113a</ref>\n* \"Receive the payment.

He  was born and lived in [[Kafri]], [[Sassanid Asuristan|Sassanid Babylonia]]. He established at [[Sura (city)|Sura]] the systematic study of the [[rabbinic]] traditions, which, using the [[Mishnah]] as text, led to the compilation of the [[Talmud]]. With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia,<ref>{{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}</ref> around the year 220. In the Talmud, he is frequently associated with [[Samuel of Nehardea]], with whom he debated many issues.\n\n==Biography==\nHis surname, '''Arikha''' (English, \"Long\"\u2014that is, \"Tall\"; it occurs only once\u2014''Hullin'' 137b), he owed to his height, which exceeded that of his contemporaries. Others, reading '''Arekha,''' consider it an honorary title, \"Lecturer\".<ref>Weiss, ''Dor,'' 3:147; Jastrow, ''Dictionary'' under the word</ref> In the traditional literature he is referred to almost exclusively as '''Rav''', \"the Master\", (both his contemporaries and posterity recognizing in him a master), just as his teacher, [[Judah HaNasi]], was known simply as ''Rabbi''. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the ''[[tannaitic]]'' literature,<ref>For instance, [[Tosefta]] ''Beitzah '' 1:7</ref> where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the ''Tannaim'' and the ''Amoraim'', and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an ''amora'', of disputing the opinion of a ''tanna''.<ref>''Bava Batra'' 42a and elsewhere</ref>\n\nRav was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to [[Shimei]], brother of [[King David]].<ref>''Sanhedrin'' 5a; ''Ketubot'' 62b</ref> His father, Aibo, was a brother of [[Hiyya the Great]] who lived in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch [[Judah haNasi]]. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncle's disciple and as a member of the academy at [[Sepphoris]], Rav acquired such knowledge of the tradition as to make him its foremost exponent in Babylonia. While Judah haNasi was still living, Rav, having been ordained as teacher (with certain restrictions<ref>''Sanhedrin'' 5a</ref>), returned to [[Babylonia]], where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism.\n\nIn the annals of the Babylonian schools, the year of his arrival is recorded as the starting-point in the chronology of the Talmudic age. It was the 530th year of the [[Seleucid]]an and the 219th year of the [[common era]]. As the scene of his activity, Rav first chose [[Nehardea]], where the [[exilarch]] appointed him ''[[agoranomos]]'', or market-master, and [[Rav Shela|Rabbi Shela]] made him lecturer (''amora'') of his college.<ref>''[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Bava Batra'' 5 15a; ''Yoma'' 20b</ref> Then he moved to [[Sura (city)|Sura]], on the [[Euphrates]], where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rav lived and worked in Sura until his death. [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]], another disciple of Judah haNasi, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rav that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Rav's activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.\n\nLittle is known of Rav's personal life. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture.<ref>''Hullin'' 105a</ref> He is referred to as the son of noblemen,<ref>Shabbat 29a</ref> but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. [[Rashi]] does tell us that he is being described as the son of great men. He was highly respected by the [[Gentile]]s as well as by the Jews of Babylonia, as shown by the friendship which existed between him and the last [[Parthia]]n king, [[Artabanus V (of Parthia)|Artaban]].<ref>''Avodah Zarah'' 10b</ref> He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of [[Ardashir I|Ardeshir]], founder of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty, although [[Samuel of Nehardea]] probably did so.\n\nRav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, [[Mar Ukba]] and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the Talmud, the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. Chiyya did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple [[Rav Huna]]. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of [[exilarch]].<ref>''Hullin'' 92a</ref>\n\nRav died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism.<ref>''Shabbat'' 110a, ''Mo'ed Katan'' 24a</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rav. That method takes the [[Mishnah]] of [[Judah haNasi]] as a text or foundation, adding to it the other ''tannaitic'' traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Rav's name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. His numerous disciples\u2014some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuel\u2014amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rav. In the Babylonian schools, Rav was rightly referred to as \"our great master.\" Rav also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of marriage and divorce, and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of ritual observance.\n\nRav, says tradition, found an open, neglected field and fenced it in.<ref>''Hullin'' 110a</ref>\n\n==Teachings==\nHe gave special attention to the [[liturgy]] of the [[synagogue]]. The [[Aleinu]] prayer first appeared in the manuscript of the [[Rosh Hashana]] liturgy by Rav. He included it in the Rosh Hashana [[mussaf]] service as a prologue to the Kingship portion of the [[Amidah]]. For that reason some attribute to Rav the authorship, or at least the revising, of Aleinu.<ref>Jacobson, B.S., ''The Weekday Siddur: An Exposition and Analysis of its Structure, Contents, Language and Ideas'' (2nd ed, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 307; Nulman, Macy, ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) page 24.</ref> In this noble prayer are evinced profound religious feeling and exalted thought, as well as ability to use the [[Hebrew language]] in a natural, expressive, and classical manner.<ref>''Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah'' 1 57a</ref>\n\nThe many [[homiletic]] and [[ethical]] sayings recorded of him show similar ability. The greatest aggadist among Babylonian ''[[Amoraim]]'', he is the only one of them whose aggadic utterances approach in number and contents those of the Palestinian haggadists. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] has preserved a large number of his [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggadah|aggadic]] utterances; and the Palestinian ''[[Midrashim]]'' also contain many of his ''aggadot''. Rav delivered homiletic discourses, both in the [[beit midrash]] and in the synagogues. He especially loved to discuss in his homilies the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the [[aggadah]], are his creations. His ''aggadah'' is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these teachings may be quoted here:\n* \"The commandments of the [[Torah]] were only given to purify men's morals\"<ref>[[Genesis Rabbah]] 44</ref>\n* \"Whatever may not properly be done in public is forbidden even in the most secret chamber\"<ref>''Shabbat'' 64b</ref>\n* \"In the future, a person will give a judgement and accounting over everything that his eye saw and he did not eat.\"<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], Kiddushin 4:12</ref>\n* \"Whoever lacks pity for his fellow man is no child of [[Abraham]]\"<ref>''Beitzah'' 32b</ref>\n* \"Better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace than to publicly shame one's fellow man.\"<ref>''Bava Metzia'' 59a</ref>\n* \"One should never betroth himself to a woman without having seen her; one might subsequently discover in her a blemish because of which one might loathe her and thus transgress the commandment: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'\"<ref>''Kiddushin'' 41a</ref>\n* \"A father should never prefer one child above another; the example of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] shows what evil consequences may result.\"\n* \"While the dates are still in the borders of your skirt, run off with them to the distillery!\" [Meaning, before one wastes what he has, let him convert it into something more productive]<ref>''Pesachim'' 113a</ref>\n* \"Receive the payment. Deliver the goods!\" [i.e. do not sell on credit]<ref>''Pesachim'' 113a</ref>\n* \"[Better to come] under the displeasure of Ishmael (i.e. the Arabs) than [the displeasure of] Rome; [better to come] under the displeasure of Rome than [the displeasure of] a Persian; [better to come] under the displeasure of a Persian than [the displeasure of] a disciple of the Sages;  [better to come] under the displeasure of a disciple of the Sages than [the displeasure of] an orphan and widow.\"<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.11a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Shabbat 11a]</ref>\n* \"A man ought always to occupy himself in the words of the Law, and in the commandments, even if it were not for their own sake.
