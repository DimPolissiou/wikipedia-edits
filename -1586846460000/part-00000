In this country, a fried egg served with boiled rice covered in tomato sauce is called ''[[arroz a la cubana]]'' in Spanish and the same dish is served in parts of Latin America, Italy (so-called ''occhio di bue'', transl: ox's eye), the Philippines, and Portugal as well.\n\nPoet [[Naz\u0131m Hikmet]] says, in an interview, that he stayed with a Spanish friend for a month and ate fried eggs almost every day.<ref name=\"Hikmet1989\">{{cite book|author=Vera Tulyakova Hikmet|title=N\u00e2z\u0131m\u02bela s\u00f6yle\u015fi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GjiAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Cem Yay\u0131nevi}}</ref>\n\nSpanish painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] painted a portrait of an elderly lady frying eggs in 1618.<ref>[[:es:Vieja friendo huevos|Spanish painter Vel\u00e1zquez painted a portrait of an elderly lady frying eggs in 1618]]</ref>\n\n=== Japan ===\nCalled \"medama yaki\" (\u76ee\u7389\u713c\u304d, lit.: cooked eyeball), fried eggs are usually made sunny side up. They may be served with salt and pepper, soy sauce or Japanese style [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Fried eggs are a popular breakfast dish, with toasted sliced bread or rice.\n\n=== Korea ===\nCalled \uacc4\ub780\ubd80\uce68 (gyeranbuchim, 'egg pancake') or more commonly \uacc4\ub780\ud6c4\ub77c\uc774 (gyeran hurai, 'egg fry'). Eggs are fried in [[cooking oil]], sometimes with a sprinkle of salt. It is common to put a fried egg on top of ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[bibimbap]]}}'' or ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[Kimchi bokkeumbap]]}}''. Sometimes, rice dishes, such as ''{{lang|ko-Latn|bokkeumbap}}'', are simply made by applying a fried egg on a top of a bowl of hot rice, drizzled with a spoonful of ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gochujang]]}}'' and [[sesame oil]]. Occasionally, [[sodium chloride|salt]] is added to fried eggs, and served as ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[Banchan]]}}'', which refers to small dishes of food served along with [[Bap (food)|bap]]. In [[Busan]] area, fried eggs are often served with [[Jjajangmyeon]].\n\n=== Malaysia and Singapore ===\nJust like in Indonesia, [[nasi goreng]], one of the popular [[fried rice]] dish in [[Cuisine of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]] and [[Cuisine of Singapore|Singapore]] is often served with a fried egg.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[File:Uitsmijter bacon kaas.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|uitsmijter spek en kaas}}'': fried eggs with bacon and cheese]]\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], a fried egg (''{{lang|nl|spiegelei}}'') is normally served on top of a slice of bread (white or whole wheat), often with fried bacon, for breakfast or lunch.<ref>{{cite book|author=van Limburg Stirum, C.

Another version is placed on buttered bread over a generous slice of cold meat, e.g., cooked beef or ham, and usually garnished with a dill pickle.

It is served in the morning with garlic rice and a choice of breakfast meat such as beef [[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|''tapa'']], [[Longaniza#Philippines|longaniza]], fried milkfish, dried fish, ''[[tocino]]'' (caramelised pork), [[Spam (food)|Spam]], or [[corned beef]], such as in [[tapsilog]] and its variants.  In addition, fried eggs are eaten in a dish called [[Arroz a la cubana]], which is seasoned ground beef with raisins, cubed potatoes, tomato sauce, and olives, along with white rice and fried ripe plantains.

The egg white is thoroughly cooked.\n; over hard ''or'' over well\n: Cooked on both sides all the way through, with the yolk intact.\n; sunny side up\n: Cooked on one side only, until the egg white is set, but the yolk remains liquid. This is often known simply as ''eggs up''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Gently splashing the hot cooking oil or fat over the sunny side uncooked white (i.e., [[Basting (cooking)|basting]]) may be done to thoroughly cook the white. Covering the frying pan with a lid during cooking (optionally adding a cover and half-teaspoon of water just before finishing) allows for a less \"runny\" egg, and is an alternative method to flipping for cooking an egg over easy (this is occasionally called ''sunny side down'' or ''basted''). Sunny side up eggs are also commonly referred to as ''dippy eggs'' or ''dip eggs'' by [[Maryland]]ers, by [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] people living in central [[Pennsylvania]], in parts of [[Ohio]], and in [[Pittsburgh]] mainly due to the practice of dipping toast into the yolk while eating. This term is also occasionally used in Canada.\n\n=== Vietnam and Cambodia ===\nA fried egg served over white rice, topped with a dab of [[Oyster sauce|oyster]] or [[hoisin sauce]], is also popular in east Asia. Fried eggs are also sometimes used in a [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]] [[Banh Mi|breakfast roll]].\n\nIn Cambodia, a common dish is called loc lok, is a fried egg served on top of a ring of spinach, onion finely shaven and tomoto with either a portion of deer or beef and gravy topped with a fried egg either duck or chicken.\n\n== Egg in the basket ==\n[[File:Making eggs in basket.jpg|thumb|right|Eggs in the basket]]\n<!-- This section can be clarified as \"a description of the 'egg in a basket' organized around how it is made.\" -->\n{{Main|Egg in the basket}}\n\nThis dish is usually made by cutting a circle or other shape out of a slice of bread, often using a drinking glass or biscuit cutter.  The bread is fried until brown on one side and then flipped, and an egg is broken into the center and seasoned, usually with [[edible salt|salt]] and [[black pepper|pepper]], and sometimes [[herb]]s. The pan is then covered, and the egg is cooked until the white is just set.  The cutout center of the bread is often fried as well, and served alongside or on top of the finished egg.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}\n*[[Egg sandwich]]\n*[[List of egg dishes]]\n*''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cookbook-inline|Fried Eggs}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Fried eggs}}\n\n{{Eggs}}\n\n[[Category:Egg dishes]]\n[[Category:Fried foods]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRegional adaptations and specialities", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_egg"}

He denies existed norms and creates his own new rules. People in Korean society, where is very authoritative, get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo because he says what they want to say on behalf of them. Pengsoo always says \"right thing\". Sometimes he says so straight to his boss and even he calls just his boss's name. This could not be imagined in Korean society. Probably, It seems to people get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo. He was chosen as the person of the year (even he is not a person). Also, there is a fun situation in Korea. People who are big fans of Pengsoo promised that \"Pengsoo is Pengsoo.\" That means Pengsoo is just a 10-years-old Penguin from the South Pole. General people can think Pengsoo is a \"penguin doll and there is another person in the doll.\" But there is a kind of promise among the Pengsoo's fans. They just see Pengsoo is Pengsoo, not a doll. If you are not a Pengsoo's fan, it can be heard strange to you, but just think of this a kind of the game. \n\n== Influence ==\nHe was chosen as the person of the year. He is one of the most influential penguins in Korea now and he has shot lots of TV commercial and public advertisements like vote encouragement and cheering the public from COVID-19 pandemic.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQjzH0QQ3I Pengsoo COVID-19 cheering ]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-rhqWpjVag Pengsoo's the right way to wash your hand.]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqE0NIHQwU Pengsoo Vote encouragement]\n\n== Pengsoo's fandom ==\nPensoo's fanclub name is \ud3ad\ud074\ub7fd (Pengclub).

However, Pengsoo is not gentle or stereotypical of [[Children's television series]]. Its personality is confident, out-spoken, yet caring and warm-hearted. So, Pengsoo shows the role of an [[antihero]] to compare with Pororo or other characters.<ref>[https://www.hankyung.com/life/article/201910028249Y '\ud3adTV' \ud3ad\uc218 \"\uad50\uc721\uc740 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc778\uc0dd \uadf8 \uc790\uccb4\"], \ud55c\uad6d\uacbd\uc81c, 2019-10-2.</ref> This works as a charming point for [[Kidult]]s, \"adults who were kids at once\"<ref>[https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/5229291 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\ub7f0 \ud3ad\uadc4\uc740 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4\u20262030\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ub85c\uc7a1\uc740 '\ud3ad\uc218'], \ub178\ucef7\ub274\uc2a4, 2019-10-17.</ref>, and has built a fandom with over 1.96 million [[YouTube]] subscribers.

EP.31], [[YouTube]]</ref>\n\n== Pengsoo syndrome ==\nPeople, especially adults (Kidults) love him because he is genuine, independent and self-confident. He denies existed norms and creates his own new rules. People in Korean society, where is very authoritative, get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo because he says what they want to say on behalf of them. Pengsoo always says \"right thing\". Sometimes he says so straight to his boss and even he calls just his boss's name. This could not be imagined in Korean society. Probably, It seems to people get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo. He was chosen as the person of the year (even he is not a person). Also, there is a fun situation in Korea. People who are big fans of Pengsoo promised that \"Pengsoo is Pengsoo.\" That means Pengsoo is just a 10-years-old Penguin from the South Pole. General people can think Pengsoo is a \"penguin doll and there is another person in the doll.\" But there is a kind of promise among the Pengsoo's fans. They just see Pengsoo is Pengsoo, not a doll. If you are not a Pengsoo's fan, it can be heard strange to you, but just think of this a kind of the game. \n\n== Influence ==\nHe was chosen as the person of the year. He is one of the most influential penguins in Korea now and he has shot lots of TV commercial and public advertisements like vote encouragement and cheering the public from COVID-19 pandemic.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQjzH0QQ3I Pengsoo COVID-19 cheering ]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-rhqWpjVag Pengsoo's the right way to wash your hand.]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqE0NIHQwU Pengsoo Vote encouragement]\n\n== Pengsoo's fandom ==\nPensoo's fanclub name is \ud3ad\ud074\ub7fd (Pengclub).

EBS made Pengsoo calendar, Pengsoo pajama, Pengsoo mug, Pengsoo diary, Pengsoo clothes... and so on.

On 1 June 1832, {{lang|fr|[[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]]|italic=no}}, a popular former Army commander who became a member of the French parliament and was critical of the monarchy, died of [[cholera]]. The riots that followed his funeral sparked the rebellion. This was the last outbreak of violence linked with the [[July Revolution]] of 1830.\n\nThe French author {{lang|fr|[[Victor Hugo]]|italic=no}} described the rebellion in his novel {{lang|fr|[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]|italic=yes}}, and it figures largely in the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|stage musical]] and [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Adaptations|films]] that are based on the book.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1830 [[July Revolution]], the elected [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] had established a constitutional monarchy and replaced [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] of the [[House of Bourbon]] with his more liberal cousin [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]].

Harvest failures, food shortages, and increases in the cost of living created discontent throughout the classes. In the spring of 1832 [[Paris]] suffered a widespread outbreak of [[cholera]], which ended with a death toll of 18,402 in the city and 100,000 across France. The poor neighbourhoods of Paris were devastated by the disease, arousing suspicion of the government poisoning wells.<ref name=\"harsin\" />{{rp|57\u201358}}\n\nThe [[epidemic]] soon claimed two well-known victims. Prime Minister [[Casimir Perier]] fell sick and died on 16 May, and the hero of the Napoleonic wars and reformer [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]] died on 1 June. The conservative Perier was given a grand [[state funeral]]. The funeral of the popular Lamarque\u2014described by Hugo as \"loved by the people because he accepted the chances the future offered, loved by the mob because he served the emperor well\"\u2014was an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the opposition.<ref name=\"harsin\">{{cite book |last=Harsin |first=Jill |title=Barricades: The War of the Streets in Revolutionary Paris, 1830\u20131848 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcMfGnKKRu0C |publication-place=New York |publisher=Palgrave |year=2002 |isbn=9780312294793}}</ref>{{rp|58}}\n\nThe monarchy of [[Louis Philippe]], which had become the government of the middle class, was now attacked from two opposite sides at once.<ref name=\"seignobos\">{{cite book |last=Seignobos |first=Charles |title=A Political History of Europe, Since 1814 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.180159 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.180159/page/n158 136]\u2013138 |publication-place=New York |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |year=1900 |translator-first=Silas Marcus |translator-last=Macvane}}</ref>\n\nBefore these two deaths, there had been two significant  rebellions.

The duchess was captured in late 1832 and imprisoned until 1833. After this, the Legitimists renounced war and fell back on the press as a weapon.<ref name=\"seignobos\" />\n\n==Insurrections==\nThe republicans were led by [[secret societies]] formed of the most determined and ferocious members of their movement. These groups planned to provoke riots similar to those that had led to the 1830 July Revolution against the ministers of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. The \"[[Society of the Rights of Man]]\" was one of the most instrumental. It was organized like an army, divided into sections of twenty members each (to evade the law that forbade the association of more than twenty persons), with a president and vice president for each section.<ref name=\"seignobos\" />\n\nThe republican conspirators made their move at the public funeral of General Lamarque on 5 June.

They gathered around the [[catafalque]] on which the body rested. Speeches were made about Lamarque's support for Polish and Italian liberty, of which he had been a strong advocate in the months before his death.  When a red flag bearing the words {{lang|fr|La Libert\u00e9 ou la Mort}} (\"Liberty or Death\") was raised, the crowd broke into disorder and shots were exchanged with government troops.<ref name = \"marh\"/> The [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], who had given a speech in praise of Lamarque, called for calm, but the outbreak spread.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYew2jAV3-cC&pg=PA393 |title=Memoirs of General Lafayette and of the French Revolution of 1830 |last=Sarrans |first=Bernard |publisher=R.

Louis-Philippe had shown more energy and personal courage than his Bourbon predecessor [[Charles X]] had during the [[July Revolution]] two years before.<ref name=\"mansel\" /> When the king appeared in public, his supporters greeted him with cheers.

On 1 June 1832, {{lang|fr|[[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]]|italic=no}}, a popular former Army commander who became a member of the French parliament and was critical of the monarchy, died of [[cholera]]. The riots that followed his funeral sparked the rebellion. This was the last outbreak of violence linked with the [[July Revolution]] of 1830.\n\nThe French author {{lang|fr|[[Victor Hugo]]|italic=no}} described the rebellion in his novel {{lang|fr|[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]|italic=yes}}, and it figures largely in the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|stage musical]] and [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Adaptations|films]] that are based on the book.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1830 [[July Revolution]], the elected [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] had established a constitutional monarchy and replaced [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] of the [[House of Bourbon]] with his more liberal cousin [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]]. This angered [[Republicanism|republicans]] who saw one king replaced by another, and by 1832 the sentiment that their revolution, for which many of them had died, had been stolen.<ref name = \"marh\">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Traugott |title=The Insurgent Barricade |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |pages=4\u20138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isK7AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT21 |isbn=9780520947733}}</ref> However, over and above the easily-provoked 'fury' or 'rage' of the Parisian population (at the differences between their poverty and the differences in income and opportunities of the bourgoisie and the aristocracy), [[Bonapartism|Bonapartists]] for their part lamented the loss of Napoleon's empire, and the [[Legitimists]] supported the deposed Bourbon dynasty, seeking to place the man they regarded as the true king in power: Charles's grandson and designated successor [[Henri, Count of Chambord]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Causes and catalysts==\n[[File:General Jean Maximilien Lamarque.jpg|thumb|General Jean Lamarque was admired by republicans for his defeat of Legitimists in the Vend\u00e9e in 1815 and his support of international republican movements.]]\nLeading up to the rebellion, there were significant economic problems, particularly acute in the period from 1827 to 1832.  Harvest failures, food shortages, and increases in the cost of living created discontent throughout the classes. In the spring of 1832 [[Paris]] suffered a widespread outbreak of [[cholera]], which ended with a death toll of 18,402 in the city and 100,000 across France. The poor neighbourhoods of Paris were devastated by the disease, arousing suspicion of the government poisoning wells.<ref name=\"harsin\" />{{rp|57\u201358}}\n\nThe [[epidemic]] soon claimed two well-known victims. Prime Minister [[Casimir Perier]] fell sick and died on 16 May, and the hero of the Napoleonic wars and reformer [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]] died on 1 June. The conservative Perier was given a grand [[state funeral]]. The funeral of the popular Lamarque\u2014described by Hugo as \"loved by the people because he accepted the chances the future offered, loved by the mob because he served the emperor well\"\u2014was an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the opposition.<ref name=\"harsin\">{{cite book |last=Harsin |first=Jill |title=Barricades: The War of the Streets in Revolutionary Paris, 1830\u20131848 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcMfGnKKRu0C |publication-place=New York |publisher=Palgrave |year=2002 |isbn=9780312294793}}</ref>{{rp|58}}\n\nThe monarchy of [[Louis Philippe]], which had become the government of the middle class, was now attacked from two opposite sides at once.<ref name=\"seignobos\">{{cite book |last=Seignobos |first=Charles |title=A Political History of Europe, Since 1814 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.180159 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.180159/page/n158 136]\u2013138 |publication-place=New York |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |year=1900 |translator-first=Silas Marcus |translator-last=Macvane}}</ref>\n\nBefore these two deaths, there had been two significant  rebellions. In France's second city, [[Lyon]], a workers' uprising known as the [[Canut revolts|Canut revolt]], caused by economic hardships, had occurred in December 1831.

The duchess was captured in late 1832 and imprisoned until 1833. After this, the Legitimists renounced war and fell back on the press as a weapon.<ref name=\"seignobos\" />\n\n==Insurrections==\nThe republicans were led by [[secret societies]] formed of the most determined and ferocious members of their movement. These groups planned to provoke riots similar to those that had led to the 1830 July Revolution against the ministers of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. The \"[[Society of the Rights of Man]]\" was one of the most instrumental. It was organized like an army, divided into sections of twenty members each (to evade the law that forbade the association of more than twenty persons), with a president and vice president for each section.<ref name=\"seignobos\" />\n\nThe republican conspirators made their move at the public funeral of General Lamarque on 5 June.

They gathered around the [[catafalque]] on which the body rested. Speeches were made about Lamarque's support for Polish and Italian liberty, of which he had been a strong advocate in the months before his death.  When a red flag bearing the words {{lang|fr|La Libert\u00e9 ou la Mort}} (\"Liberty or Death\") was raised, the crowd broke into disorder and shots were exchanged with government troops.<ref name = \"marh\"/> The [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], who had given a speech in praise of Lamarque, called for calm, but the outbreak spread.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYew2jAV3-cC&pg=PA393 |title=Memoirs of General Lafayette and of the French Revolution of 1830 |last=Sarrans |first=Bernard |publisher=R.

She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''. On 1 September 1762,<ref name=nomprestigieux>{{cite web |last1=Mioque |first1=Nicolas |title=La Bretagne : origine d\u2019un nom prestigieux dans la Marine fran\u00e7aise |url=https://troisponts.net/2019/02/01/la-bretagne-origine-dun-nom-prestigieux-dans-la-marine-francaise/ |website=Trois Ponts ! |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=French |date=1 February 2019}}</ref> the [[Estates of Brittany]] gathered at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Rennes<ref name=binet212>Binet, p.212</ref> and decided to raise one million [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] in order to offer a 100-gun [[Three-decker]].<ref name=binet211>Binet, p.211</ref> [[Ship-of-the-line lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Jean-Claude Louis de Quelen rode to [[Choisy-le-Roi]]<ref name=binet215>Binet, p.215</ref> to inform [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], arriving on 5 and returning on 9 with acceptance letters from the King and from the Duke de Choiseul.<ref name=nomprestigieux /> Administrative dispositions for the loan started on 2 November, and were completed by 17.<ref name=binet217>Binet, p.217</ref> Budget would eventually reach  1,010,000 [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]].<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 />\n\nThe donation had political connotations, both in terms of rivalry between the various donating institutions, and for the status of Bretagne within France.<ref name=forrer13>Forrer, p. 13</ref> Therefore, the Estates of Brittany attached their gift to a number of requests: that the ship be named ''Bretagne'' rather than ''\u00c9tats de Bretagne'', that the crew be composed of Bretons exlusively, and that the ship be a three-decker.<ref name=binet213>Binet, p.213</ref> Furthermore, rather than donate funds that the Crown would invest in construction, the Estates demanded to supervise construction themselves at the shipyards of the [[French East India Company]] in [[Lorient]].<ref name=nomprestigieux /><ref name=binet211 />\n\n== Construction ==\nOn 2 November 1761, the Commission of the Estates of Brittany in charge of construction mandated [[Antoine Groignard]] as chief engineer, with Gaubry as deputy and Damel as an advisor.<ref name=binet218>Binet, p.218</ref> Groignard worked both for the French Royal Navy and for the French East India Company; he had recently directed the construction of the 80-gun [[French ship Orient (1756)|''Orient'']], the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], the 64-gun [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] and [[French ship Solitaire (1774)|''Solitaire'']], and was supervising ongoing construction of the 74-gun [[French ship Diligent (1763)|''Diligent'']] and [[French ship Six Corps (1762)|''Six Corps'']], the 56-gun [[French ship Bordelois|''Bordelois'']] in Lorient, that of the 56-gun [[French ship Utile (1764)|''Utile'']],  [[French ship Ferme (1763)|''Ferme'']] and [[French ship Flamand|''Flamand'']] in [[Bordeaux]], and four frigates in Nantes.<ref name=binet219>Binet, p.219</ref> \n\nOn 17 November 1761, Groignard sent of proposal for a budget between 919,000 and 1,115,000 pounds.<ref name=binet220>Binet, p.220</ref> The shipyards in Lorient received their first orders in early December.<ref name=binet221>Binet, p.221</ref> Choiseul wrote the Groignard to congratulate him for his appointment, and to argue in favour of building a 80-gun two-decker, with [[36-pounder long gun|36-pounders]] on the lower battery and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]] on the upper, although he conceded that political considerations mandated a three-decker.

On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.
