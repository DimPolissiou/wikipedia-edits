Rajendrasinghji, DSO.\n\nThe attack from Solapur was led by Major General [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]] and was composed of four task forces:\n# Strike Force comprising a mix of fast moving infantry, cavalry and light artillery,\n# Smash Force consisting of predominantly armoured units and artillery,\n# Kill Force composed of infantry and engineering units\n# Vir Force which comprised infantry, anti-tank and engineering units.\nThe attack from [[Vijaywada|Vijayawada]] was led by Major General [[Ajit Rudra]] and comprised the 2/5 Gurkha Rifles, one squadron of the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], and a troop from the [[19th Field Battery]] along with engineering and ancillary units. In addition, four infantry battalions were to neutralize and protect lines of communication. Two squadrons of [[Hawker Tempest]] aircraft were prepared for air support from the [[Pune]] base.\n\nThe date for the attack was fixed as 13 September, even though [[General]] Sir [[Roy Bucher]], the Indian chief of staff, had objected on grounds that Hyderabad would be an additional front for the Indian army after [[Kashmir]].\n\n==Commencement of hostilities==\n{{more citations needed section|date = February 2012}}\n[[File:Operation Polo 1948.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Indian Army movements during the Operation Polo]]\n\n===Day 1, 13 September===\nIndian forces entered the state at 4 a.m.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Note|url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1948-JULY-DEC-MIN-OF-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1948-09-13_170.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive|date=13 September 1948|accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> The first battle was fought at [[Naldurg]] Fort on the Solapur Secundarabad Highway between a defending force of the [[Hyderabad Infantry, Indian State Forces|1st Hyderabad Infantry]] and the attacking force of the 7th Brigade. Using speed and surprise, the 7th Brigade managed to secure a vital bridge on the Bori river intact, following which an assault was made on the Hyderabadi positions at Naldurg by the 2nd Sikh Infantry. The bridge and road secured, an armoured column of the 1st Armoured Brigade \u2013 part of the Smash force \u2013 moved into the town of [[Jalkot]], 8&nbsp;km from Naldurg, at 0900 hours, paving the way for the Strike Force units under Lt.

This armoured column reached the town of [[Umarge]], 61&nbsp;km inside Hyderabad by 1515 hours, where it quickly overpowered resistance from Razakar units defending the town.\nMeanwhile, another column consisting of a squadron of [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], a troop from [[18th King Edward's Own Cavalry]], a troop from 9 Para Field Regiment, 10 Field Company Engineers, [[2nd Punjab Regiment|3/2 Punjab Regiment]], [[1 Gorkha Rifles|2/1 Gurkha Rifles]], 1 [[Mewar]] Infantry, and ancillary units attacked the town of [[Tuljapur]], about 34&nbsp;km north-west of Naldurg. They reached Tuljapur at dawn, where they encountered resistance from a unit of the 1st Hyderabad Infantry and about 200 Razakars who fought for two hours before surrendering. Further advance towards the town of [[Lohara, Osmanabad|Lohara]] was stalled as the river had swollen. The first day on the Western front ended with the Indians inflicting heavy casualties on the Hyderabadis and capturing large tracts of territory. Amongst the captured defenders was a British mercenary who had been tasked with blowing up the bridge near [[Naldurg]].\n\nIn the East, forces led by Lt. Gen A.A.

Pressing on, the force reached [[Mungala]] by the afternoon.\n\nThere were further incidents in [[Hospet]] \u2013 where the [[1st Mysore]] assaulted and secured a [[sugar factory]] from units of Razakars and [[Pashtun people|Pathans]] \u2013 and at [[Tungabhadra]] \u2013 where the [[5 Gorkha Rifles|5/5 Gurkha]] attacked and secured a vital bridge from the Hyderabadi army.\n\n===Day 2, 14 September===\nThe force that had camped at Umarge proceeded to the town of [[Rajeshwar]], 48&nbsp;km east. As aerial reconnaissance had shown well entrenched ambush positions set up along the way, the air strikes from squadrons of [[Hawker Tempest|Tempests]] were called in. These air strikes effectively cleared the route and allowed the land forces to reach and secure Rajeshwar by the afternoon.\n\nThe Assault force from the East was meanwhile slowed down by an anti-tank ditch and later came under heavy fire from hillside positions of the [[1st Duke of York's Own Lancers (Skinner's Horse)|1st Lancers]] and [[5th Mahratta Light Infantry|5th Infantry]] 6&nbsp;km from Suryapet. The positions were assaulted by the 2/5 Gurkha \u2013 veterans of the [[Burma Campaign]] \u2013 and was neutralised with the Hyderabadis taking severe casualties.\n\nAt the same time, the [[11 Gorkha Rifles|3/11 Gurkha Rifles]] and a squadron of 8th Cavalry attacked [[Osmanabad]] and took the town after heavy street combat with the Razakars who determinedly resisted the Indians.<ref name=\"hindu\">{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/14/stories/2005091405050200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=When the Indian Army liberated thousands | date=14 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nA force under the command of Maj. Gen. D.S. Brar was tasked with capturing the city of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]. The city was attacked by six columns of infantry and cavalry, resulting in the civil administration emerging in the afternoon and offering a surrender to the Indians.\n\nThere were further incidents in [[Jalna (city)|Jalna]] where 3 Sikh, a company of 2 Jodhpur infantry and some tanks from 18 Cavalry faced stubborn resistance from Hyderabadi forces.\n\n===Day 3, 15 September===\nLeaving a company of 3/11 Gurkhas to occupy the town of [[Jalna (city)|Jalna]], the remainder of the force moved to [[Latur]], and later to [[Ambajogai|Mominabad]] where they faced action against the 3 Golconda Lancers who gave token resistance before surrendering.\n\nAt the town of [[Suryapet|Surriapet]], air strikes cleared most of the Hyderabadi defences, although some Razakar units still gave resistance to the 2/5 Gurkhas who occupied the town. The retreating Hyderabadi forces destroyed the bridge at Musi to delay the Indians but failed to offer covering fire, allowing the bridge to be quickly repaired. Another incident occurred at [[Narketpally|Narkatpalli]] where a Razakar unit was decimated by the Indians.\n\n===Day 4, 16 September===\nThe task force under Lt. Col. Ram Singh moved towards [[Zahirabad]] at dawn, but was slowed down by a minefield, which had to be cleared. On reaching the junction of the Bidar road with the Solapur-[[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad City]] Highway, the forces encountered gunfire from ambush positions. However, leaving some of the units to handle the ambush, the bulk of the force moved on to reach 15 kilometres beyond Zahirabad by nightfall in spite of sporadic resistance along the way. Most of the resistance was from Razakar units who ambushed the Indians as they passed through urban areas. The Razakars were able to use the terrain to their advantage until the Indians brought in their 75&nbsp;mm guns.\n\n===Day 5, 17 September===\nIn the early hours of 17 September, the Indian army entered [[Bidar]]. Meanwhile, forces led by the 1st Armoured regiment were at the town of [[Chityal, Nalgonda district|Chityal]] about 60&nbsp;km from [[Hyderabad]], while another column took over the town of [[Hingoli]]. By the morning of the 5th day of hostilities, it had become clear that the Hyderabad army and the Razakars had been routed on all fronts and with extremely heavy casualties. At 5 pm on 17 September the Nizam announced ceasefire thus ending the armed action.<ref name=\"hindu\"/>\n\n==Capitulation and surrender==\n\n===Consultations with Indian envoy===\nOn 16 September, faced with imminent defeat, the Nizam summoned the Prime Minister [[Mir Laiq Ali]] and requested his resignation by the morning of the following day. The resignation was delivered along with the resignations of the entire cabinet.\n\nOn the noon of 17 September, a messenger brought a personal note from the Nizam to India's Agent General to Hyderabad, [[K.M. Munshi]] summoning him to the Nizam's office at 1600 hours. At the meeting, the Nizam stated \"The vultures have resigned. I don't know what to do\". Munshi advised the Nizam to secure the safety of the citizens of Hyderabad by issuing appropriate orders to the Commander of the Hyderabad State Army, Major General [[Syed Ahmed El Edroos|El Edroos]].

This was largely done on the basis of local informants, who used this opportunity to settle scores. The estimated number of people detained was close to 18,000, which resulted in overcrowded jails and a paralyzed criminal system.\n\nThe Indian government set up Special Tribunals to prosecute these. These strongly resembled the colonial governments earlier, and there were many legal irregularities, including denial or inability to access lawyers and delayed trials - about which the Red Cross was pressuring Nehru.\n\nThe viewpoint of the government was: \"in political physics, Razakar action and Hindu reaction have been almost equal and opposite.\" A quiet decision was taken to release all Hindus and for a review of all Muslim cases, aiming to let many of them out. Regarding atrocities by Muslims, Nehru was sympathetic to Hyderabadi culture, and considered the actions during the operation as \"madness\" seizing \"decent people\", analogous to experience elsewhere during the [[Partition of India#Independence.2C population transfer.2C and violence|partition of India]]. Nehru was also concerned that disenfranchised Muslims would join the communists. Patel opposed this viewpoint, treating the penal action as restoring law and order, and signaling that there was no partiality towards Muslims.\n\nThe government was under pressure to not prosecute participants in communal violence, which often made communal relations worse. Patel had also died in 1950. Thus, by 1953 the Indian government released all but a few persons.<ref name=ShermanLSE />{{rp|12\u201316}}\n\n=== Overhaul of bureaucracy ===\nThe question of Hindu-Muslim balance in the bureaucracy was a sensitive one. Muslims had predominated in the executive, police and administrative services. Before the invasion, the Indian Cabinet, with Nehru's leadership, decided that there would be as few changes as possible. However, Patel, who had a differences of opinion with Nehru, ran his Ministry with little consultation with the Indian Cabinet. The initial plans were not followed after the invasion, partly due to different ideas at various levels of administration. Over a hundred officers were dismissed on an ethnic basis, from all levels, and many local officers were detained for their role in the violence. This pattern was seen in new hirings as well.\n\nJunior officers from neighbouring Bombay, [[Central Provinces|CP]] and Madras regions were appointed to replace the vacancies. They were unable to speak the language and were unfamiliar with local conditions. Nehru objected to this \"communal chauvinism\" and called them \"incompetent outsiders\", and tried to impose Hyderabadi residency requirements: however, this was circumvented by using forged documents.<ref name=ShermanLSE />{{rp|17\u201318}}\n\n==References==\n<section begin=SharedRef /> <!-- Needed for transclusion in [[Hyderabad State (1948\u201356)]] -->\n{{reflist|30em|\nrefs=\n<ref name=\"BBC Hyderabad 1948\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24159594 | title=Hyderabad 1948: India's hidden massacre | publisher=BBC | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 | author=Thomson, Mike}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2017|reason=The version of the Sunderlal report is different from the original}}</ref>\n<section end=SharedRef />\n<ref name=ShermanLSE>{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|first1=Taylor C.|title=The integration of the princely state of Hyderabad and the making of the postcolonial state in India, 1948 \u2013 56|journal=Indian Economic & Social History Review|volume=44|issue=4|pages=489\u2013516|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/32805/1/Sherman_Integration_princely_state_2007.pdf|date=2007|doi=10.1177/001946460704400404}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n<section begin=bibliography />\n* {{citation |first=Lucien D. |last=Benichou |title=From Autocracy to Integration: Political Developments in Hyderabad State, 1938-1948 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Loiq3YrFy40C&pg=PA214 |year=2000 |publisher=Orient Blackswan |isbn=978-81-250-1847-6 |ref={{sfnref|Benichou, From Autocracy to Integration|2000}}}}\n* {{citation |first=Mohammed |last=Hyder |title=October Coup, A Memoir of the Struggle for Hyderabad |publisher=Roli Books |year=2012 |isbn=978-8174368508 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdumBAAAQBAJ}}\n* {{citation |last=Hodson |first=H.

The bridge and road secured, an armoured column of the 1st Armoured Brigade \u2013 part of the Smash force \u2013 moved into the town of [[Jalkot]], 8&nbsp;km from Naldurg, at 0900 hours, paving the way for the Strike Force units under Lt.

This armoured column reached the town of [[Umarge]], 61&nbsp;km inside Hyderabad by 1515 hours, where it quickly overpowered resistance from Razakar units defending the town.\nMeanwhile, another column consisting of a squadron of [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], a troop from [[18th King Edward's Own Cavalry]], a troop from 9 Para Field Regiment, 10 Field Company Engineers, [[2nd Punjab Regiment|3/2 Punjab Regiment]], [[1 Gorkha Rifles|2/1 Gurkha Rifles]], 1 [[Mewar]] Infantry, and ancillary units attacked the town of [[Tuljapur]], about 34&nbsp;km north-west of Naldurg. They reached Tuljapur at dawn, where they encountered resistance from a unit of the 1st Hyderabad Infantry and about 200 Razakars who fought for two hours before surrendering. Further advance towards the town of [[Lohara, Osmanabad|Lohara]] was stalled as the river had swollen. The first day on the Western front ended with the Indians inflicting heavy casualties on the Hyderabadis and capturing large tracts of territory. Amongst the captured defenders was a British mercenary who had been tasked with blowing up the bridge near [[Naldurg]].\n\nIn the East, forces led by Lt. Gen A.A.

Pressing on, the force reached [[Mungala]] by the afternoon.\n\nThere were further incidents in [[Hospet]] \u2013 where the [[1st Mysore]] assaulted and secured a [[sugar factory]] from units of Razakars and [[Pashtun people|Pathans]] \u2013 and at [[Tungabhadra]] \u2013 where the [[5 Gorkha Rifles|5/5 Gurkha]] attacked and secured a vital bridge from the Hyderabadi army.\n\n===Day 2, 14 September===\nThe force that had camped at Umarge proceeded to the town of [[Rajeshwar]], 48&nbsp;km east. As aerial reconnaissance had shown well entrenched ambush positions set up along the way, the air strikes from squadrons of [[Hawker Tempest|Tempests]] were called in. These air strikes effectively cleared the route and allowed the land forces to reach and secure Rajeshwar by the afternoon.\n\nThe Assault force from the East was meanwhile slowed down by an anti-tank ditch and later came under heavy fire from hillside positions of the [[1st Duke of York's Own Lancers (Skinner's Horse)|1st Lancers]] and [[5th Mahratta Light Infantry|5th Infantry]] 6&nbsp;km from Suryapet. The positions were assaulted by the 2/5 Gurkha \u2013 veterans of the [[Burma Campaign]] \u2013 and was neutralised with the Hyderabadis taking severe casualties.\n\nAt the same time, the [[11 Gorkha Rifles|3/11 Gurkha Rifles]] and a squadron of 8th Cavalry attacked [[Osmanabad]] and took the town after heavy street combat with the Razakars who determinedly resisted the Indians.<ref name=\"hindu\">{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/14/stories/2005091405050200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=When the Indian Army liberated thousands | date=14 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nA force under the command of Maj. Gen. D.S. Brar was tasked with capturing the city of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]. The city was attacked by six columns of infantry and cavalry, resulting in the civil administration emerging in the afternoon and offering a surrender to the Indians.\n\nThere were further incidents in [[Jalna (city)|Jalna]] where 3 Sikh, a company of 2 Jodhpur infantry and some tanks from 18 Cavalry faced stubborn resistance from Hyderabadi forces.\n\n===Day 3, 15 September===\nLeaving a company of 3/11 Gurkhas to occupy the town of [[Jalna (city)|Jalna]], the remainder of the force moved to [[Latur]], and later to [[Ambajogai|Mominabad]] where they faced action against the 3 Golconda Lancers who gave token resistance before surrendering.\n\nAt the town of [[Suryapet|Surriapet]], air strikes cleared most of the Hyderabadi defences, although some Razakar units still gave resistance to the 2/5 Gurkhas who occupied the town. The retreating Hyderabadi forces destroyed the bridge at Musi to delay the Indians but failed to offer covering fire, allowing the bridge to be quickly repaired. Another incident occurred at [[Narketpally|Narkatpalli]] where a Razakar unit was decimated by the Indians.\n\n===Day 4, 16 September===\nThe task force under Lt. Col. Ram Singh moved towards [[Zahirabad]] at dawn, but was slowed down by a minefield, which had to be cleared. On reaching the junction of the Bidar road with the Solapur-[[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad City]] Highway, the forces encountered gunfire from ambush positions. However, leaving some of the units to handle the ambush, the bulk of the force moved on to reach 15 kilometres beyond Zahirabad by nightfall in spite of sporadic resistance along the way. Most of the resistance was from Razakar units who ambushed the Indians as they passed through urban areas. The Razakars were able to use the terrain to their advantage until the Indians brought in their 75&nbsp;mm guns.\n\n===Day 5, 17 September===\nIn the early hours of 17 September, the Indian army entered [[Bidar]]. Meanwhile, forces led by the 1st Armoured regiment were at the town of [[Chityal, Nalgonda district|Chityal]] about 60&nbsp;km from [[Hyderabad]], while another column took over the town of [[Hingoli]]. By the morning of the 5th day of hostilities, it had become clear that the Hyderabad army and the Razakars had been routed on all fronts and with extremely heavy casualties. At 5 pm on 17 September the Nizam announced ceasefire thus ending the armed action.<ref name=\"hindu\"/>\n\n==Capitulation and surrender==\n\n===Consultations with Indian envoy===\nOn 16 September, faced with imminent defeat, the Nizam summoned the Prime Minister [[Mir Laiq Ali]] and requested his resignation by the morning of the following day. The resignation was delivered along with the resignations of the entire cabinet.\n\nOn the noon of 17 September, a messenger brought a personal note from the Nizam to India's Agent General to Hyderabad, [[K.M. Munshi]] summoning him to the Nizam's office at 1600 hours. At the meeting, the Nizam stated \"The vultures have resigned. I don't know what to do\". Munshi advised the Nizam to secure the safety of the citizens of Hyderabad by issuing appropriate orders to the Commander of the Hyderabad State Army, Major General [[Syed Ahmed El Edroos|El Edroos]].

This was largely done on the basis of local informants, who used this opportunity to settle scores. The estimated number of people detained was close to 18,000, which resulted in overcrowded jails and a paralyzed criminal system.\n\nThe Indian government set up Special Tribunals to prosecute these. These strongly resembled the colonial governments earlier, and there were many legal irregularities, including denial or inability to access lawyers and delayed trials - about which the Red Cross was pressuring Nehru.\n\nThe viewpoint of the government was: \"in political physics, Razakar action and Hindu reaction have been almost equal and opposite.\" A quiet decision was taken to release all Hindus and for a review of all Muslim cases, aiming to let many of them out. Regarding atrocities by Muslims, Nehru was sympathetic to Hyderabadi culture, and considered the actions during the operation as \"madness\" seizing \"decent people\", analogous to experience elsewhere during the [[Partition of India#Independence.2C population transfer.2C and violence|partition of India]]. Nehru was also concerned that disenfranchised Muslims would join the communists. Patel opposed this viewpoint, treating the penal action as restoring law and order, and signaling that there was no partiality towards Muslims.\n\nThe government was under pressure to not prosecute participants in communal violence, which often made communal relations worse. Patel had also died in 1950. Thus, by 1953 the Indian government released all but a few persons.<ref name=ShermanLSE />{{rp|12\u201316}}\n\n=== Overhaul of bureaucracy ===\nThe question of Hindu-Muslim balance in the bureaucracy was a sensitive one. Muslims had predominated in the executive, police and administrative services. Before the invasion, the Indian Cabinet, with Nehru's leadership, decided that there would be as few changes as possible. However, Patel, who had a differences of opinion with Nehru, ran his Ministry with little consultation with the Indian Cabinet. The initial plans were not followed after the invasion, partly due to different ideas at various levels of administration. Over a hundred officers were dismissed on an ethnic basis, from all levels, and many local officers were detained for their role in the violence. This pattern was seen in new hirings as well.\n\nJunior officers from neighbouring Bombay, [[Central Provinces|CP]] and Madras regions were appointed to replace the vacancies. They were unable to speak the language and were unfamiliar with local conditions. Nehru objected to this \"communal chauvinism\" and called them \"incompetent outsiders\", and tried to impose Hyderabadi residency requirements: however, this was circumvented by using forged documents.<ref name=ShermanLSE />{{rp|17\u201318}}\n\n==References==\n<section begin=SharedRef /> <!-- Needed for transclusion in [[Hyderabad State (1948\u201356)]] -->\n{{reflist|30em|\nrefs=\n<ref name=\"BBC Hyderabad 1948\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24159594 | title=Hyderabad 1948: India's hidden massacre | publisher=BBC | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 | author=Thomson, Mike}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2017|reason=The version of the Sunderlal report is different from the original}}</ref>\n<section end=SharedRef />\n<ref name=ShermanLSE>{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|first1=Taylor C.|title=The integration of the princely state of Hyderabad and the making of the postcolonial state in India, 1948 \u2013 56|journal=Indian Economic & Social History Review|volume=44|issue=4|pages=489\u2013516|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/32805/1/Sherman_Integration_princely_state_2007.pdf|date=2007|doi=10.1177/001946460704400404}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n<section begin=bibliography />\n* {{citation |first=Lucien D. |last=Benichou |title=From Autocracy to Integration: Political Developments in Hyderabad State, 1938-1948 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Loiq3YrFy40C&pg=PA214 |year=2000 |publisher=Orient Blackswan |isbn=978-81-250-1847-6 |ref={{sfnref|Benichou, From Autocracy to Integration|2000}}}}\n* {{citation |first=Mohammed |last=Hyder |title=October Coup, A Memoir of the Struggle for Hyderabad |publisher=Roli Books |year=2012 |isbn=978-8174368508 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdumBAAAQBAJ}}\n* {{citation |last=Hodson |first=H.
