He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers, [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]], [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], reigned in turn before him.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting [[Viking]] invasions. He won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the [[Danelaw]] in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader [[Guthrum]] to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people's quality of life. He was given the epithet \"the Great\" during and after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and, alongside the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Cnut the Great]], remains the only king of England to be given such a name.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the royal estate of [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]], between 847 and 849.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Nelson|2y=2003|2p=295}}{{efn|According to Asser, Alfred was born in 849 but a regnal list thought to have been produced at his court states that he was 23 years old when he acceded and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that he acceeded after Easter in 871. These sources imply that he was born between Easter 847 and Easter 848.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=47\u201348}}}} He was the youngest of five sons of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. In 853 Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}}\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how, as a child, Alfred won a book of Saxon poems, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}} Statues of Alfred in [[Winchester]] and [[Wantage]] portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc=\"Historical Note\" (p. 385 and following)}}\n\n==Alfred's brothers==\n[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]\n\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]] of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16\u201317}} Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old \u00c6thelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius'', which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic [[Tanistry|tanist]], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander. {{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}} The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870 and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} \u00c6thelred died shortly afterwards in April.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n==King at war==\n\n===Early struggles===\nIn April 871 King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though \u00c6thelred left two under-age sons, [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=135}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nThe Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91\u2013110}}\n\nIn 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} He negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a \"holy ring\" associated with the worship of [[Thor]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 876}}{{sfn|Arnold|2011|p=59}} The Danes broke their word and after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 877}}\n\nAlfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas \"and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount a resistance campaign, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} 878 was the nadir of the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}}\n\n===The cake legend===\nA legend tells how when Alfred first fled to the [[Somerset Levels]], he was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}}{{sfn|Horspool|2006|p=2}} Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return. There is no contemporary evidence for the legend, although it is possible that there was an early oral tradition. The first time that it was actually written down was about one hundred years after Alfred's death.{{sfn|Horspool|2006|p=2}}\n\n===Counter-attack and victory===\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on the supposed site of Egbert's Stone, the mustering place before the [[Battle of Edington]].{{efn|The inscription reads \"ALFRED THE GREAT AD 879 on this Summit Erected his Standard Against Danish Invaders To him We owe The Origin of Juries The Establishment of a Militia The Creation of a Naval Force ALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age Was a Philosopher and a Christian The Father of his People The Founder of the English MONARCHY and LIBERTY\".{{harv|Horspool|2006|pages=73}} }} ]]\n\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4\u201310 May 878), around [[Whitsuntide]], Alfred rode to [[Egbert's Stone]] east of [[Selwood, Somerset|Selwood]] where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of [[Wiltshire]] and of that part of [[Hampshire]] which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of [[Southampton Water]]), and they rejoiced to see him\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the [[fyrd]]s of three [[shire]]s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pages=187\u201391}}\n\nAlfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Edington]] which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]]. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\nAccording to Asser,\n\n{{quote|The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A chrisom was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[Baptism|baptised]] or christened.

Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 60}} The formal [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}\n\nThat treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101|loc= [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} In 825 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the peoples of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey had surrendered to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], Alfred's grandfather. From then until the arrival of the [[Great Heathen Army]] Essex had formed part of Wessex. After the foundation of Danelaw, it seems that some of Essex would have been ceded to the Danes, but how much is not clear.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nIn 2015, two metal detectorists operating without landowner permission found a large hoard near [[Leominster]] consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. The hoard is believed to have been buried by a Viking during their raids of the area, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred and Mercia by Ceolwulf II. Coins recovered from the treasure hunters depict both kings, \"indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms\u2014at least, for a time\u2014that was previously unknown to historians\".<ref name=\"newsweek.com\" /> According to Gareth Williams of the [[British Museum]], \"these coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom.\"<ref name=\"bbc.com\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that the find \"rewrites Anglo-Saxon history&nbsp;...

According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=23}}\n\nThis is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=106}} This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact, he would never adopt the title for himself. Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died.

Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation.

They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore.

The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west.

(Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Military reorganisation==\n[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service|source={{harvnb|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n[[File:winchesterwalls.jpg|thumb|right|The walled defence round a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations.]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (of which twenty two developed into [[borough]]s.{{efn|The Alfredian ''burh'' represented a stage in the evolution of English medieval towns and boroughs. Of the twenty two burhs that became boroughs three did not attain full town status.{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}{{sfn|Loyn|1991|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}) ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{Hdvkuaddkfgh{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean western Asia, as other versions say \"[[Iudea]]\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"[[Scoti|Scots]]\" (i.e. [[Early medieval Ireland|Irish]]) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]] may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.{{sfn|Keynes|1999|loc=\"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\"}}\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to [[Adam]], thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Effect of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''</ref> He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.{{sfn|Bately|2014|pp=113-142}}\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Life of King Alfred]]'',\n\n{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ... [He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour ... [and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind.|source={{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=74\u201375}} }}\n\nIt is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as \"shameful negligence\" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became lady of the Mercians; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler#Ancient through medieval eras|Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita \u00c6lfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as [[Bede]] tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under [[C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex|C\u00e6dwalla]].{{sfn|Bristol University|2010}}\n\n[[Osferth]] was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother \u2013 mistakenly according to Keynes and Lapidge, and in the view of [[Janet Nelson]] he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=322, n. 79}}{{sfn|Nelson|1999|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n{| class = wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Name!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Birth!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Death!! style=\"width:64%;\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]]||||12 June 918||Married c. 886, [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]] d. 911; had issue\n|-\n|[[Edward the Elder|Edward]]||c. 874||17 July 924||Married (1) [[Ecgwynn]], (2) [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], (3) 919 [[Eadgifu of Kent|Eadgifu]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]]||||||Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]]||||16 October 922(?)|| Married and had issue\n|-\n|[[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]]||||929||Married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] d. 918; had issue\n|}\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Alfred the Great's will.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred's will]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=308}} How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness.

Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred.

In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis that had been unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, and had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period.

Later medieval historians such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.

He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers, [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]], [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], reigned in turn before him.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting [[Viking]] invasions. He won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the [[Danelaw]] in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader [[Guthrum]] to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people's quality of life. He was given the epithet \"the Great\" during and after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and, alongside the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Cnut the Great]], remains the only king of England to be given such a name.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the royal estate of [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]], between 847 and 849.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Nelson|2y=2003|2p=295}}{{efn|According to Asser, Alfred was born in 849 but a regnal list thought to have been produced at his court states that he was 23 years old when he acceded and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that he acceeded after Easter in 871. These sources imply that he was born between Easter 847 and Easter 848.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=47\u201348}}}} He was the youngest of five sons of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. In 853 Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}}\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how, as a child, Alfred won a book of Saxon poems, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}} Statues of Alfred in [[Winchester]] and [[Wantage]] portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc=\"Historical Note\" (p. 385 and following)}}\n\n==Alfred's brothers==\n[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]\n\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]] of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16\u201317}} Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old \u00c6thelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius'', which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic [[Tanistry|tanist]], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander. {{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}} The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870 and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} \u00c6thelred died shortly afterwards in April.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n==King at war==\n\n===Early struggles===\nIn April 871 King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though \u00c6thelred left two under-age sons, [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=135}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nThe Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91\u2013110}}\n\nIn 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} He negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a \"holy ring\" associated with the worship of [[Thor]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 876}}{{sfn|Arnold|2011|p=59}} The Danes broke their word and after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 877}}\n\nAlfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas \"and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount a resistance campaign, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} 878 was the nadir of the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.

This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pages=187\u201391}}\n\nAlfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Edington]] which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]]. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\nAccording to Asser,\n\n{{quote|The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A chrisom was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[Baptism|baptised]] or christened.

Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 60}} The formal [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}\n\nThat treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101|loc= [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} In 825 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the peoples of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey had surrendered to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], Alfred's grandfather. From then until the arrival of the [[Great Heathen Army]] Essex had formed part of Wessex. After the foundation of Danelaw, it seems that some of Essex would have been ceded to the Danes, but how much is not clear.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nIn 2015, two metal detectorists operating without landowner permission found a large hoard near [[Leominster]] consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. The hoard is believed to have been buried by a Viking during their raids of the area, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred and Mercia by Ceolwulf II.

According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia.

Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died.

The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of King Alfred The Great and the Danes|url=http://www.localhistories.org/alfred.html|publisher=Local Histories|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Viking attacks (890s)===\n\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege of Exeter (893)|Siege of Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Military reorganisation==\n[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service|source={{harvnb|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n[[File:winchesterwalls.jpg|thumb|right|The walled defence round a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations.]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (of which twenty two developed into [[borough]]s.{{efn|The Alfredian ''burh'' represented a stage in the evolution of English medieval towns and boroughs. Of the twenty two burhs that became boroughs three did not attain full town status.{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}{{sfn|Loyn|1991|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}) ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean western Asia, as other versions say \"[[Iudea]]\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"[[Scoti|Scots]]\" (i.e. [[Early medieval Ireland|Irish]]) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]] may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.{{sfn|Keynes|1999|loc=\"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\"}}\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to [[Adam]], thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Effect of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''</ref> He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.{{sfn|Bately|2014|pp=113-142}}\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Life of King Alfred]]'',\n\n{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ...

Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became lady of the Mercians; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler#Ancient through medieval eras|Butler]] of England.

His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either [[Crohn's disease]] or [[haemorrhoids]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}}{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=58}} His grandson King [[Eadred]] seems to have suffered from a similar illness.{{sfn|Malmesbury|1904|p=145}}{{efn|According to St Dunstan's apprentice, \"poor King Eadred would suck the juice out of the food, chew what remained for a little while and spit it out: a nasty practice that often turned the stomachs of the thegns who dined with him.\"{{sfn|Dunstan|1992|p=248}}}}\n\nAlfred was buried temporarily in the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] in [[Winchester]]. Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}}\n\nExcavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}} The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones, suggested at the time to be those of Alfred; they proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}} In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The diocese made no claim that they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of [[King Richard III]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}}{{sfn|Cohen|2013}} The bones were radiocarbon-dated but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore not of Alfred. In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis that had been unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, and had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], but this remains unproven.{{sfn|BBC|2014}}{{sfn|Keys|2014}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|Cultural depictions of Alfred the Great}}\n[[File:Statue of King Alfred in Wantage Market Square.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Alfred the Great at [[Wantage]], Oxfordshire]]\n\nAlfred is venerated as a saint by some Christian traditions.<ref name=\"cathsaints\">{{cite web|title=Saint Alfred the Great|url=https://catholicsaints.info/saint-alfred-the-great/|website=CatholicSaints.info|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref> Though [[Henry VI of England]] attempted unsuccessfully to have him canonized by [[Pope Eugene IV]] in 1441, he was venerated sometimes in the Catholic Church; however the current \"[[Roman Martyrology]]\" does not mention him.<ref>http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92430</ref>{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=231}}{{efn|Some Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that Alfred should be recognised as a saint.

Later medieval historians such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.

To date Amos Gitai has created over 90 works of art throughout 40 years. His films were presented in the Cannes Film Festival for the Palme d'Or as well as The Venice International Film Festival for the Golden Lion award.[citation needed] \nHe has worked with Juliette Binoche, Jeanne Moreau, Natalie Portman, Yael Abecassis, Samuel Fuller, Hanna Schygulla, Annie Lennox, Barbara Hendricks, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, Henri Alekan, Renato Berta, Nurith Aviv, \u00c9ric Gautier and more. \nSince 2000 he has been collaborating with the French screenwriter Marie-Jos\u00e9 Sanselme. He received several prestigious prizes, such as the Leopard of Honor at the Locarno International Film Festival (2008), the Roberto Rossellini prize (2005), the Robert Bresson prize (2013), the Paradjanov prize (2014), and L\u00e9gion d'Honneur (2017). In 2018, Amos Gitai has been elected professor at the chair of artistic creation at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, with a series of 12 lessons on cinema.\n\n\n==Early life==\nGitai was born to [[Munio Weinraub]] (Gitai), an architect formed at the [[Interbellum|pre-war]] German [[Bauhaus]] art school, and to [[Efratia Margalit]], an intellectual, storyteller and a teacher.<ref name=\"Cannes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmfestivals.com/cannes99/html/seloff4.htm |title=Film Festival : Cannes 99 |publisher=Filmfestivals.com |date= |accessdate=29 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183721/http://www.filmfestivals.com/cannes99/html/seloff4.htm |archivedate=29 June 2011 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web |url= http://www.amosgitai.com/html/page.asp?docid=5&lang=1 |title= Conversation Amos Gitai / Peter Cowie|work=Amos Gitai official homepage |accessdate=26 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215071253/http://www.amosgitai.com/html/page.asp?docid=5&lang=1|archivedate=15 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"IMDb\">{{IMDb name|0321159}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=60&lang=1 |title=Munio Weinraub Gitai Architect (1909-1970) &#124; The Films of Amos Gitai |publisher=Amosgitai.com |date= |accessdate=29 July 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015183905/http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=60&lang=1|archivedate=15 October 2009}}</ref> He holds a degree in Architecture from the [[Technion]] in Haifa and a PhD in Architecture from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. \n\nIn 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], Gitai had to interrupt his architecture studies as he was called up to reserve service as part of a helicopter rescue crew.

The film follows a house in West Jerusalem, abandoned during the 1948 war by its Palestinian owner. It was rejected and was censored by Israeli television; however, it was screened at the Berlin and the Rotterdam International Film Festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=36&lang=0 |title=House / La Maison &#124; The Films of Amos Gitai |publisher=Amosgitai.com |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328095650/http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=36&lang=0|archivedate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nHouse was the first trilogy of many others; a concept Gitai consistently worked with during his career, offering a complex and layered view on the Geo-political Israeli reality.\n\n\"Gita\u00ef wants this house to be both a symbol and something very concrete; he wants it to become a character in a film. He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape. The film's central idea is simple and the film has simply the force of that idea, no more, no less.\" (Serge Daney, Lib\u00e9ration, 1 March 1982)\n\nWadi (''Wadi'' 1981, ''Wadi Ten Years After'' 1991, ''Wadi Grand Canyon'' 2001), similar to House is dealing with a specific location and examines the complex relationships between the residents of the former stone quarry: Eastern European immigrants, survivors of the camps and Arabs who have also been expelled from their homes. Gitai turns the valley into a symbol of a possible coexistence.<ref>http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=39&lang=1</ref>\n \nIn 1982 he directed \"Field Diary\" (1982).

Events are re-enacted in a sequence of ritual tableaux shot in the ruins of Wadi Salib, the old Arab neighbourhood of Haifa that the Palestinians abandoned after the 1948 war. The sense of ancient unsettled scores that have simmered for centuries is almost palpable in this beautiful but ravaged territory. In the most striking shots, the actors seem to blend into the architecture like the figures in Persian miniatures. These shots are pointedly contrasted with others photographed in the same vicinity, which make it look like a squalid contemporary junkyard. The juxtapositions suggest how overwhelmingly the region's history continues to haunt Israel's present.\" (Stephen Holden, ''The New York Times'', 19 May 1989)\n\n[[File:Gitai88.jpg|thumb|250px|Amos Gitai and [[Henri Alekan]], shooting Esther, 1986.]]\n\nThe \"City Trilogy\" (''[[Devarim (film)|Devarim]]'', 1995 ; ''[[Yom Yom]]'', 1998 ; ''[[Kadosh]]'', 1999), was created after Gitai's return to Israel in 1993, after [[Yitzhak Rabin]]\u2019s victory in the elections and the [[Oslo Accords]]. Each film is dedicated to a different city in Israel: \"Devarim\" takes place in Tel Aviv, and is after the novel by Yaakov Shabtai, Past Continuous. The film depicts the spiritual disarray of three men in their thirties and forties, in the agitation and turmoil of Tel Aviv, the city created by Jewish pioneers in 1909. None of them has the life he had imagined. \"Yom Yom\" draws upon Haifa's tradition of peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jewish neighbours to tell a dark comic tale of characters driven by divided loyalties and neurotic inhibitions. Leslie Camhi wrote \"Gita\u00ef\u2019s genius is to show the conflict infiltrating every encounter, from the marketplace to the bedroom and beyond; the vivid portraits of Israeli social types, whether arrogant reservists or hapless nebbishes, stand in sharp contrast to images promoted in the media.\" (Leslie Camhi, Village Voice, 20 February 2001). \n''[[Kadosh]]'' is set in [[Mea Shearim]], the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem and tells the story of Me\u00efr and Rivka, that have been married for ten years but have to divorce because they have no children.

Among them are the demands of ultra-orthodox religion, which confines as it sustains, and the suffering of men and women whose religion comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain. Yet Kadosh is also foreign in the extreme, an austere and shocking portrait of daily life in Mea Shearim, the Hasidic Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. ( ... ) Kadosh is a horror story, or rather two horror stories intertwined, about women tyrannised by men in the name of religious belief.\"\n(The Wall Street Journal, 17 March 2000)\n\"Kadosh\" was entered into the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/kadosh Kadosh in 1999 Cannes Film Festival]</ref>\n\nAnother fiction trilogy deals with important historical events in Israel: ''[[Kippur]]'', 2000; ''[[Eden (2001 film)|Eden]]'', 2001; ''[[Kedma (film)|Kedma]]'', 2002.\n''Kippur''  (2000) was Israel's first large-scale cinematic depiction of the considerably difficult and traumatic [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973.

We never know for certain and then we realise that this uncertainty is in fact the most profound truth of war, as cinema has hardly ever shown it, with a force and an intensity that takes your breath away. [\u2026] The principle for filming warfare in Kippur is simple, limpid. Favouring real time spaces, [\u2026] making the camera an extra person walking with the soldiers, running behind the others to get on the helicopter before it takes off.

His killer apprehended at the scene turned out to be a 25-year-old Jewish observant. Investigation into this brutal murder reveals a dark and frightening world that made this tragic deed possible. A subculture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure Talmudic ruling. The prominent right wing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. \nAnd the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it. The film sheds light on an ever-growing crisis of hate in Israeli society today. \nGitai combines staged re-enactments with actual news footage of the shooting and its aftermath to create a thought-provoking political thriller.<ref>https://charlierose.com/videos/23077.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n\"A few years ago we decided to make this project on the assassination of Rabin as a kind of a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not the most efficient way to change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects. I hope that this is something that we do with this multi-format presentation, with a film installation, a performance, and research materials about and around the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin\" (Amos Gitai).\n\nIn 2017, Amos Gitai returns to the occupied territories for the first time since his 1982 documentary \"Field Diary\". \"WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER\" describes the efforts of Israelis and Palestinians citizens, who try to overcome the consequences of the occupation. Gitai's documentary shows the human ties woven by the military, human rights activists, journalists, mourning mothers and even Jewish settlers. Faced with the failure of politics to solve the occupation, these men and women rise and act in the name of their civic consciousness. This human energy is a proposal for long overdue change. The film was premiered in Cannes International Film Festival 2017 \u2013 Directors' Fortnight.\n\n2018 is a year of intense activity for Amos Gitai, who presents at [[the Venice Film Festival]] \"A TRAMWAY IN JERUSALEM\", a light-hearted and dramatic fare on a tramway that connects several of Jerusalem's neighborhoods from East to West, bringing together a mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"The film describes an ironic, almost utopian situation in which most of the conflicts are contained and this beautiful city of Jerusalem charged with thousands of years of history facilitates people\u2019s way of living side by side.\" (Amos Gitai) \nCast: [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Pippo Delbono]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Hanna Laszlo]], among 36 Israeli, Palestinian and European actors and actresses.\n\nThe film is preceded by Amos Gitai's \"[[A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GAZA]]\" (2018, 34 mins, in Hebrew & Arabic). The film responds to the current crisis between Israel and Gaza. 2 Palestinians and 2 Israelis read texts inspired by [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Yizhar Smilansky]], [[Emile Habibi]] and [[Amira Hass]], as an homage to a famous letter written by [[Albert Camus]] in 1943, which gives its title to the film.\n\n===Novel adaptations===\nGitai created several novel adaptations. ''One day you'll understand'' (\"Plus tard tu comprendras\", 2008) is based on an autobiographical book by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]], president of the Arte television channel and one of the leading figures of French culture, and tells the story of a French writer tracing the story of his Jewish mother ([[Jeanne Moreau]]) and her family during World War II.<ref>[[:fr:J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n<ref>A.

''[[Tsili]]'' (2014) is inspired by the novel by [[Aharon Appelfeld]], and tells the story of the wandering of its heroine submerged in the nightmare of the war. Tsili, a young Jewish woman, gathers all the forces of intuition and vitality to survive in this desperate universe. \nstarring [[Sarah Adler]], Meshi Olinski, and [[Lea Koenig]].\n<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/e-nina-rothe/best-of-venice-with-tsili_b_5815176.html</ref>\n\"I was inspired by what Aharon Appelfeld told Philip Roth :The reality of the Holocaust surpassed any imagination. If I remained true to the facts, no one would believe me. But the moment I chose a girl, a little older than I was at that time, I removed ''the story of my life'' from the mighty grip of memory and gave it over to the creative laboratory. There memory is not the only proprietor. There one needs a causal explanation, a thread to tie things together. The exceptional is permissible only if it is part of an overall structure and contributes to its understanding. \nWhen I wrote ''Tsili'' I was interested in the possibilities of naiveness in art. Can there be a naive modern art? It seemed to me that without the naivete still found among children and old people and, to some extent, in ourselves, the work of art would be flawed. I tried to correct that flaw.\" (Amos Gitai)\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller\".jpg|thumb|Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller]] -->\n\n===Exhibitions, publications and performances===\nGitai\u2019s work include film installations, stage work and books publications. Various publications and exhibitions took place, devoted to his parents Munio and Efratia: Traces at the Palais de Tokyo (Paris), the [[Bauhaus]] (Dessau, Germany), the art museum of the Ein Harod kibbutz (Israel), and Kib- butz Kfar Masaryk Dining Hall at the MoMA (New York, 2013). Retrospective and installation at the Museo nazionale del cinema in Turin.\nIn 2010 Gitai presents at The Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe \"The War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness\", a work staged in the Boulbon quarry, at the Avignon Festival (July 2009). He publishes as well the letters of his mother Efratia (Efratia Gitai: Correspondence 1929\u20131994, Gallimard), which are read by Jeanne Moreau at the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe and on France Culture.

In Yitzhak Rabin : chronique d\u2019un assassinat, Gitai uses the memories of Leah Rabin, the Prime Minister's widow, as a springboard. Four voices (two actresses, Hiam Abbass and Sarah Adler, and two musicians, Edna Stern (piano) and [[Sonia Wieder-Atherton]] (cello) create a recitative, \u201chalfway between lament and lullaby,\u201d to travel back through History and explore the incredible violence with which the nationalist forces fought the peace project, tearing Israel apart. Four voices caught \u201clike in an echo chamber,\u201d between image-documents and excerpts from classic and contemporary literature.\n\nIn July 2016, a 540-page book on Amos Gitai was published by Galerie Enrico Navarra and S\u00e9bastien Moreu. The book includes more than 250 reproductions from movies and research, but also family archives and creations by Amos Gitai and 7 conversations between Gitai and : [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]], [[Guy Amsellem]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Hou Hanru]], [[Annette Michelson]], [[Richard Ingersoll]], [[Elisabeth Lebovici]] & [[Stephan Levine]]), two poems (Mount Carmel and Lullaby to My Father) and a poetic essay on the Golem.\n<ref>[[\u00c9lisabeth Lebovici]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\nOn 8 October 2018, the [[Philharmonie de Paris]] presents \"[[Yitzhak Rabin Chronicle of an Assassination]]\" created in Avignon in 2016, with [[Barbara Hendricks]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Sarah Adler]], [[Gavriel Lipkind]] (cello), [[Edna Stern]] (piano).\n\n==Personal life==\nGitai was born in Haifa and divides his time today between Paris and Haifa.\n\n==Filmography==\n[[File:Golem l'esprit de l'exil - Shemesh and Schygulla - 1992.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Ophrah Shemesh]] and [[Hanna Schygulla]] in ''[[Golem, the Spirit of the Exile]]'', 1991]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''My Mother at the Seashore'' (1973)\n* ''Bayit'' (1980)\n* ''Yoman Sadeh'' (1982)\n* ''Bangkok-Bahrein'' (1983) \n* ''Ananas'' (1984)\n* ''[[Esther (1986 film)|Esther]]'' (1986)\n* ''Brand New Day''\n* ''[[Berlin-Jerusalem]]'' (1989)\n* ''{{ill|Birth of a Golem|fr|Naissance d'un Golem}}'' (1991)\n* ''[[Golem, the Spirit of the Exile]]'' (1992)\n* ''{{ill|Zihron Devarim|fr|Devarim (film)}}'' (1995)\n* ''Zirat Ha'Rezach'' (1996)\n* ''[[Metamorphosis of a Melody]]'' (1996)\n* ''War and Peace in Vesoul'' (1997)\n* ''{{ill|A House in Jerusalem|it}}'' (1998)\n* ''Orange'' (1998)\n* ''Zion, Auto-Emancipation'' (1998)\n* ''{{ill|Yom Yom|fr}}'' (1998)\n* ''[[Kadosh]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Kippur]]'' (2000)\n* ''{{ill|Eden (2001 film)|lt=Eden|fr|Eden (film, 2001)}}'' (2001)\n* ''[[Kedma (film)|Kedma]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[11'09\"01 September 11]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Alila]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Promised Land (2004 film)|Promised Land]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Free Zone (film)|Free Zone]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Disengagement (film)|Disengagement]]'' (2007)\n* ''{{ill|One day you'll understand|fr|Plus tard tu comprendras}}'' (2008)\n* ''{{ill|Carmel (film 2009)|it|lt=Carmel}}'' (2009)\n* ''The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness'' (2009)\n* ''{{lang|fr|[[Roses \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit]]}}'' (2010)\n* ''[[Lullaby to My Father]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Ana Arabia]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Words With Gods]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Tsili]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Rabin, the Last Day]]'' (2015)\n* ''West of the Jordan River'' (2017)\n* ''{{ill|A Tramway in Jerusalem|fr|Un tramway \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem}}'' (2018)\n* ''Letter to A Friend in Gaza'' (2018)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Exhibitions, performances==\n* The Law Of The Pursuer.

He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape.

In the most striking shots, the actors seem to blend into the architecture like the figures in Persian miniatures.

Each film is dedicated to a different city in Israel: \"Devarim\" takes place in Tel Aviv, and is after the novel by Yaakov Shabtai, Past Continuous. The film depicts the spiritual disarray of three men in their thirties and forties, in the agitation and turmoil of Tel Aviv, the city created by Jewish pioneers in 1909. None of them has the life he had imagined. \"Yom Yom\" draws upon Haifa's tradition of peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jewish neighbours to tell a dark comic tale of characters driven by divided loyalties and neurotic inhibitions. Leslie Camhi wrote \"Gita\u00ef\u2019s genius is to show the conflict infiltrating every encounter, from the marketplace to the bedroom and beyond; the vivid portraits of Israeli social types, whether arrogant reservists or hapless nebbishes, stand in sharp contrast to images promoted in the media.\" (Leslie Camhi, Village Voice, 20 February 2001). \n''[[Kadosh]]'' is set in [[Mea Shearim]], the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem and tells the story of Me\u00efr and Rivka, that have been married for ten years but have to divorce because they have no children.

Among them are the demands of ultra-orthodox religion, which confines as it sustains, and the suffering of men and women whose religion comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain. Yet Kadosh is also foreign in the extreme, an austere and shocking portrait of daily life in Mea Shearim, the Hasidic Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. ( ... ) Kadosh is a horror story, or rather two horror stories intertwined, about women tyrannised by men in the name of religious belief.\"\n(The Wall Street Journal, 17 March 2000)\n\"Kadosh\" was entered into the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/kadosh Kadosh in 1999 Cannes Film Festival]</ref>\n\nAnother fiction trilogy deals with important historical events in Israel: ''[[Kippur]]'', 2000; ''[[Eden (2001 film)|Eden]]'', 2001; ''[[Kedma (film)|Kedma]]'', 2002.\n''Kippur''  (2000) was Israel's first large-scale cinematic depiction of the considerably difficult and traumatic [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973.

His killer apprehended at the scene turned out to be a 25-year-old Jewish observant. Investigation into this brutal murder reveals a dark and frightening world that made this tragic deed possible. A subculture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure Talmudic ruling. The prominent right wing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. \nAnd the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it. The film sheds light on an ever-growing crisis of hate in Israeli society today. \nGitai combines staged re-enactments with actual news footage of the shooting and its aftermath to create a thought-provoking political thriller.<ref>https://charlierose.com/videos/23077.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n\"A few years ago we decided to make this project on the assassination of Rabin as a kind of a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not the most efficient way to change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects. I hope that this is something that we do with this multi-format presentation, with a film installation, a performance, and research materials about and around the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin\" (Amos Gitai).\n\nIn 2017, Amos Gitai returns to the occupied territories for the first time since his 1982 documentary \"Field Diary\". \"WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER\" describes the efforts of Israelis and Palestinians citizens, who try to overcome the consequences of the occupation. Gitai's documentary shows the human ties woven by the military, human rights activists, journalists, mourning mothers and even Jewish settlers. Faced with the failure of politics to solve the occupation, these men and women rise and act in the name of their civic consciousness. This human energy is a proposal for long overdue change. The film was premiered in Cannes International Film Festival 2017 \u2013 Directors' Fortnight.\n\n2018 is a year of intense activity for Amos Gitai, who presents at [[the Venice Film Festival]] \"A TRAMWAY IN JERUSALEM\", a light-hearted and dramatic fare on a tramway that connects several of Jerusalem's neighborhoods from East to West, bringing together a mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"The film describes an ironic, almost utopian situation in which most of the conflicts are contained and this beautiful city of Jerusalem charged with thousands of years of history facilitates people\u2019s way of living side by side.\" (Amos Gitai) \nCast: [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Pippo Delbono]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Hanna Laszlo]], among 36 Israeli, Palestinian and European actors and actresses.\n\nThe film is preceded by Amos Gitai's \"[[A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GAZA]]\" (2018, 34 mins, in Hebrew & Arabic). The film responds to the current crisis between Israel and Gaza. 2 Palestinians and 2 Israelis read texts inspired by [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Yizhar Smilansky]], [[Emile Habibi]] and [[Amira Hass]], as an homage to a famous letter written by [[Albert Camus]] in 1943, which gives its title to the film.\n\n===Novel adaptations===\nGitai created several novel adaptations. ''One day you'll understand'' (\"Plus tard tu comprendras\", 2008) is based on an autobiographical book by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]], president of the Arte television channel and one of the leading figures of French culture, and tells the story of a French writer tracing the story of his Jewish mother ([[Jeanne Moreau]]) and her family during World War II.<ref>[[:fr:J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n<ref>A.

''[[Tsili]]'' (2014) is inspired by the novel by [[Aharon Appelfeld]], and tells the story of the wandering of its heroine submerged in the nightmare of the war. Tsili, a young Jewish woman, gathers all the forces of intuition and vitality to survive in this desperate universe. \nstarring [[Sarah Adler]], Meshi Olinski, and [[Lea Koenig]].\n<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/e-nina-rothe/best-of-venice-with-tsili_b_5815176.html</ref>\n\"I was inspired by what Aharon Appelfeld told Philip Roth :The reality of the Holocaust surpassed any imagination. If I remained true to the facts, no one would believe me. But the moment I chose a girl, a little older than I was at that time, I removed ''the story of my life'' from the mighty grip of memory and gave it over to the creative laboratory. There memory is not the only proprietor. There one needs a causal explanation, a thread to tie things together. The exceptional is permissible only if it is part of an overall structure and contributes to its understanding. \nWhen I wrote ''Tsili'' I was interested in the possibilities of naiveness in art. Can there be a naive modern art? It seemed to me that without the naivete still found among children and old people and, to some extent, in ourselves, the work of art would be flawed. I tried to correct that flaw.\" (Amos Gitai)\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller\".jpg|thumb|Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller]] -->\n\n===Exhibitions, publications and performances===\nGitai\u2019s work include film installations, stage work and books publications.

Following the introduction of modernity in sculpture in Bangladesh in the 1950s by [[Novera Ahmed]], Khan was instrumental in the popularization of sculpture in the country through his distinctive form of modernity. Influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Henry Moore]], his works manifest expressionism, minimalism, and a constant exploration of purity of material. He worked on both figurative as well as abstract genres.  \n\nIn addition to sculpture, Khan is notable as a painter. Even before becoming a sculptor, he gained recognition for his watercolor and acrylic paintings in the late 1960s. [[Zainul Abedin]], the founding father of Bangladeshi modern art, acclaimed and encouraged Khan for his watercolors. His watercolors are characterized by abstract expressionism and predominantly on the subjects of natural landscape and human figure. \n\nFor his contribution to sculpture, Khan was awarded [[Ekushey Padak]], the second-highest civilian award in [[Bangladesh]], in 2006. In a career spanning over five decades, his works have been exhibited and installed in Bangladesh, [[South Korea]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].       \n\n==Early life and education==\nKhan was born in 1946 in the village Sahasram in [[Kishoreganj District| Kishoreganj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/hamiduzzaman-khan-retrospective-opens-bnm-1482982|title=Hamiduzzaman Khan Retrospective opens at BNM|date=2017-10-29|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Indian artist [[Hemen Majumdar]] hailed from Gachihata, a neighboring village of Sahasram. Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]].

When he was a student in the Institute of Fine Arts, the then principal of the institute Zainul Abedin bought Khan\u2019s paintings. An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla (Onslaught)'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]].

Majority of Khan\u2019s sculptures are made of bronze and steel. He also worked with stone, aluminum, white granite, marble and mixed-media. His large-scale sculptures are mostly made of concrete and bronze. Though majority of his early sculptures were built in the expressionist style, his works after 2000 reflect minimalism with constant exploration for purity of forms and material. The composition of his sculptures is characterized by architectural and geometric shapes.<ref name=Critics>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=87-90 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> The war remembrance theme continued in Khan through 1985 till 1988, in different styles.

Following the introduction of modernity in sculpture in Bangladesh in the 1950s by [[Novera Ahmed]], Khan was instrumental in the popularization of sculpture in the country through his distinctive form of modernity. Influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Henry Moore]], his works manifest expressionism, minimalism, and a constant exploration of purity of material. He worked on both figurative as well as abstract genres.  \n\nIn addition to sculpture, Khan is notable as a painter. Even before becoming a sculptor, he gained recognition for his watercolor and acrylic paintings in the late 1960s. [[Zainul Abedin]], the founding father of Bangladeshi modern art, acclaimed and encouraged Khan for his watercolors. His watercolors are characterized by abstract expressionism and predominantly on the subjects of natural landscape and human figure. \n\nFor his contribution to sculpture, Khan was awarded [[Ekushey Padak]], the second-highest civilian award in [[Bangladesh]], in 2006. In a career spanning over five decades, his works have been exhibited and installed in Bangladesh, [[South Korea]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].       \n\n==Early life and education==\nKhan was born in 1946 in the village Sahasram in [[Kishoreganj District| Kishoreganj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/hamiduzzaman-khan-retrospective-opens-bnm-1482982|title=Hamiduzzaman Khan Retrospective opens at BNM|date=2017-10-29|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Indian artist [[Hemen Majumdar]] hailed from Gachihata, a neighboring village of Sahasram. Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet.
