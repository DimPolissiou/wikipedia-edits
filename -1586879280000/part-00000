Even though he loves his family more than anything in this world, he fails to express his love. He had been looking after the family since the death of their mother. Their father Pillechan ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]) is married again with two daughters and his children from the first marriage do not even speak with him (Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon is responsible for the separation between the children and Pillechan, which is revealed in a later part of the story). Madhavankutty's marriage was fixed with his neighbour Gauri and his sister Ammu\u2019s marriage with Gauri's brother Balachandran. Once in Madhavankutty's absence, Balachandran sneaked in to his house to be with Ammu, but get caught which results in hostility between the two families and Madhavankutty opposes any of the decided marriages to happen between the families. Balachandran on the other hand wants to make them happen.\n\nThings change when the eldest sister Seetha goes through an unfortunate event, where her unmarried professor under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], rapes her. Coming back to senses, the professor confesses his act to Madhavankutty. Devastated on hearing this and learning how this incident can affect the lives of his younger sisters, he is forced to go with the solution that the professor puts forward. He gets Seetha married to the professor. His sister Ammu unaware of the facts behind the marriage gets furious with him, while he, being inherently stoic, behaved as a rude dominant to hide the facts. Balachandran finds this as an opportunity to get Ammu, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t do anything against her brother\u2019s wishes. Balachandran and Ammu get married and settle in the neighbourhood.\n\nDue to the new developments, Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon ([[Kozhikode Narayanan Nair]]) tries to befriend their rival family \u2013 Kompara. They on the other hand were waiting for an opportunity to take revenge, pretend to offer help, while their real intention was to increase the hatred between Madhavankutty and his uncle as they see Madhavankutty as a threat and can never do anything unless they remain enemies. They also suggest a marriage alliance with Gauri, which Gangadhara Menon approves. Gauri, still in love with Madhavankutty, acts pregnant saying Madhavankutty as the one responsible for it to prevent the marriage. This agitates Gangadhara Menon and under the advice of Nandakumar (from Kompara family), he decides to destroy the lives of Madhavankutty\u2019s sisters, the way he destroyed Gauri's life. Madhavankutty's father learns about the plot and foils them, but it causes the girls and him to end up in the police station. He fails to convince his son about the truth and they become angrier at their father for his behaviour. Nandakumar sees the opportunity and they murder Pillechan. Madhavankutty, even though angry at his father\u2019s deeds, does not desert his half sisters and brings them home, much to the dismay of his sisters who have an argument with him and leaves to Ammu's home to stay. Balachandran realises the seriousness of the situation and asks the girls to go back to their brother. He also say that whatever he did, was for Madhavankutty to stop sacrificing his life for his sisters and to get him married to his sister who loves him for life. Balachandran goes to find Madhavankutty to apologise, but gets attacked by a gang of thugs under the command of a person, seemingly Madhavankutty, while it actually was Krishnanunni the eldest of Kompara family who framed him. Balachandran survives and thinks Madhavankutty did it, which causes everyone, even Gauri to turn against him. Gangadhara Menon along with the ones from Kompara family goes to finish Madhavankutty once and for all, but learns that he himself was the target and Balachandran was not attacked by Madhavankutty. They try to murder Menon thinking after all that has happened Madhavankutty will not dare rescue him, but to their surprise he shows up to save Menon. Wounded Menon at the hospital tells to the rest of the family about his nephew's innocence. Madhavankutty survives the attack and succeeds in getting rid of the Kompara family from their lives. Losing hope at everything he believes, he decides to leave all behind and go someplace. He does not listen to the apologies or requests of the sisters to stay. He asks Balachandran to take care of the sisters and to find a better person for Gauri as he will never be a good husband for her. He begins to leave while a youngster shows up staring at his sisters leading him to chase the one, indicating that he can't stop being himself and can never leave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Mamangalath Madhavankutty/'Hitler' Madhavankutty\n* [[Mukesh (Malayalam actor)|Mukesh]] as Mamangalath Balachandran (Madhavankutty's cousin)\n* [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as Pillai Chettan, Madhavan Kutty's Father\n* [[Jagadish]] as Hrudayabhanu\n* [[Saikumar (actor)|Saikumar]] as Nandakumar\n* [[M.G.

The boomerang hits him in this order:\n\n* Hammy is first hit and hisses like a cat at the boomerang (the kids giggle during this time but RJ dismisses it) before throwing it away again.\n* Hammy throws it again and barely dodges it but stands up and laughs triumphantly, to be hit again.\n* Hammy continuously dodges it and starts throwing the boomerang without stopping but soon realizes he is actually throwing a [[cookie]], a [[cupcake]], and an [[ice cream cone]] which prove distractive as he is hit again.\n* He scurries up a tree but the boomerang freezes next to him. He shouts \"Begone! I don't believe in you!\" but the boomerang keeps spinning around the tree, forcing him to shout \"All right, I believe in you!\" He then buries the boomerang in a deep hole and proceeds to cover it up.\n* He is hit again and finally chops it into pieces with an [[axe]], puts it in a [[trunk (luggage)|trunk]], devilishly burns it with a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]] then stomps on the hot ashes but then steps off before he is continuously hit again, until an annoyed Hammy cries \"Aww c'mon!\"\n\nRJ then asks the audience if they should tell him that the kids actually had a lot of boomerangs in a box. Verne then appears and figures out what they are doing and throws the camera away and informs them that humans do the same thing. Hammy finds the camera in the meantime and claims it. RJ and the kids then inform Verne they will not do it again.\n\nThe crew (joined by Hammy) later perform another so-called \"Unrated Version\" episode which shows Verne bathing without his shell on.

Distributed via newsstands, most comics were sold throughout Yugoslavia, written by and large in the common [[Shtokavian]] dialect and often printed in the Latin alphabet. \n\nPublications from other republics, especially Croatia, from Plavi Vjesnik to ''[[Alan Ford (comics)|Alan Ford]]'', had a great influence on creators and readers in Serbia. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] titled ''Alan Ford'' written by Mirjana Lazi\u0107 and directed by Kokan Mladenovi\u0107 was staged at Teatar T in Belgrade in 1994. [[Radio Belgrade]] produced a [[radio drama]] based on the play in 2002. \n\nAlso, authors worked for publishers outside Serbia, e.g. artists Du\u0161an Relji\u0107, Bojan \u0110uki\u0107, Ratomir Petrovi\u0107, [[Zdravko Zupan]], [[Nikola Maslovara]] and Zoran Kova\u010devi\u0107, as well as writer Lazar Odanovi\u0107 collaborated on the licensed [[Tom and Jerry]] comics for ''[[Vjesnik]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/60godina/60gstripa_10.html|title=Slobodan Ivkov: 60 godina stripa u Srbiji|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> Finally, artists exhibited at the joint Yugoslav Comics Festival in [[Vinkovci]] (Salon jugoslovenskog stripa).\n\nThe local comic book industry collapsed with the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n=== 1991 - present ===\n\n[[File:Treci_argument_cover.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel ''Tre\u0107i argument'' (''[[The Third Argument]]''), drawn by Zoran Tuci\u0107 and written by [[Zoran Stefanovi\u0107]], was based on the works of writer [[Milorad Pavi\u0107]].]]In the 1990s dozens of Serbian artists turned to foreign publishers.

The magazine lasted for 85 issues and ended in 1987.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the scene rebounded after the blow it had suffered from the 1972 tax law<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=429075|title=Mirko, Slavko i Kekec|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> which targeted not only the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] but also comics.

Published by Forum in [[Novi Sad]], ''Panorama'' was eventually transformed into ''[[Stripoteka]]'', which reached issue 1000 in 2004<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://happynovisad.com/strip/stripoteka-broj-1000.270.html|title=STRIPOTEKA broj 1000!|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> and still comes out today. [[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]] launched ''Zlatna serija'' and ''Lunov magnus strip'', featuring [[Italian comics|Italian comic books]] like [[Tex Willer|''Tex'']] and ''[[Zagor]]''. In the 1980s Kerac spearheaded teams of writers and artists working on [[Licensed production|licensed]] [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]] and [[Il Grande Blek|Blek]] comics for these two publishers. The list included artists [[Branko Plav\u0161i\u0107]], [[Goran \u0110uki\u0107 Gorski (artist)|Goran \u0110uki\u0107]], [[Miodrag Ivanovi\u0107 Mikica|Miodrag Ivanovi\u0107]], [[Pavel Koza]], [[Marinko Lebovi\u0107]], [[Petar Meseld\u017eija]], Milan Mileti\u0107, [[Sibin Slavkovi\u0107]] and [[Dragan Stoki\u0107 Raja\u010dki]]. The [[Ninja (comic book)|Ninja]] and [[Mitar Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Lun kralj pono\u0107i]] comics were similarly manufactured, but were based on the Yugoslav pulp novels of the same names.\n\nUntil 1991 Serbian comics were part of Yugoslav comics. Distributed via newsstands, most comics were sold throughout Yugoslavia, written by and large in the common [[Shtokavian]] dialect and often printed in the Latin alphabet. \n\nPublications from other republics, especially Croatia, from Plavi Vjesnik to ''[[Alan Ford (comics)|Alan Ford]]'', had a great influence on creators and readers in Serbia. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] titled ''Alan Ford'' written by Mirjana Lazi\u0107 and directed by Kokan Mladenovi\u0107 was staged at Teatar T in Belgrade in 1994. [[Radio Belgrade]] produced a [[radio drama]] based on the play in 2002. \n\nAlso, authors worked for publishers outside Serbia, e.g. artists Du\u0161an Relji\u0107, Bojan \u0110uki\u0107, Ratomir Petrovi\u0107, [[Zdravko Zupan]], [[Nikola Maslovara]] and Zoran Kova\u010devi\u0107, as well as writer Lazar Odanovi\u0107 collaborated on the licensed [[Tom and Jerry]] comics for ''[[Vjesnik]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/60godina/60gstripa_10.html|title=Slobodan Ivkov: 60 godina stripa u Srbiji|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> Finally, artists exhibited at the joint Yugoslav Comics Festival in [[Vinkovci]] (Salon jugoslovenskog stripa).\n\nThe local comic book industry collapsed with the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n=== 1991 - present ===\n\n[[File:Treci_argument_cover.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel ''Tre\u0107i argument'' (''[[The Third Argument]]''), drawn by Zoran Tuci\u0107 and written by [[Zoran Stefanovi\u0107]], was based on the works of writer [[Milorad Pavi\u0107]].]]In the 1990s dozens of Serbian artists turned to foreign publishers.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings. It was a large island in the Sundering Seas to the west of [[Middle-earth]], the main setting of Tolkien's writings, and was the greatest civilization of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. However, after centuries of prosperity many of the inhabitants ceased to worship the One God, [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], and rebelled against the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], resulting in the destruction of the island and the death of most of its people. Tolkien intended N\u00famenor to allude to the legendary [[Atlantis]].<ref name=\"Letters Atlantis\" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', ##131, 154, 156, 227.</ref>\n\nN\u00famenor first appeared in print in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set thousands of years after N\u00famenor's destruction. Within ''The Lord of the Rings'', N\u00famenor looms as a fabulous [[Lost city (fiction)|lost civilization]].\n\nAn unfinished story, ''[[Aldarion and Erendis]]'', is set in N\u00famenor at its [[zenith]]; another, ''[[Akallab\u00eath]]'', summarizes its downfall. The appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and several accounts published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series also touch upon it.\n\nOriginally intended to be a part of a time-travel story, Tolkien once saw the tale of the fall of N\u00famenor as a conclusion to his ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the \"last tale\" about the Elder Days.<ref name=\"LR1\" group=T>''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|Lost Road]]'', \"The early history of the legend\", pp. 7\u201310.</ref> Later, with the emergence of ''The Lord of the Rings'', it became the link between these two works and a major part of his [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]].\n\n==Fictional history==\n\n===Land of Gift===\n\nThe island of N\u00famenor was raised from the sea as a gift from the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] to the [[Edain]], the Fathers of Men who had stood with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Beleriand]] against [[Morgoth]] in the wars of the [[First Age]]. N\u00famenor was offered as a reward, a \"rest after the war\" for the Edain.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'': Part Two, II Aldarion and Erendis, \"The Further Course of the Narrative\"</ref> Early in the [[Second Age]] the greater part of those Edain who had survived the wars left Middle-earth and journeyed to the isle, sailing in ships provided and steered by the Elves. The migration took 50 years and brought 5,000 to 10,000 people to the island.<ref group=T>''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', p.145.</ref>\nThe realm was established early in the [[Second Age]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Day |first=David |title=Tolkien The Illustrated Encyclopedia |date=1996 |page=108 |ISBN=978-0684839790}}</ref><ref name=\"LE\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2, III, \"The Line of Elros\".</ref> and Elros [[Half-elven]], son of [[E\u00e4rendil]], and brother of [[Elrond]] and descendant of all the royal houses of Elves and Edain, became the first King of N\u00famenor, an [[absolute monarch]]. Under his rule, and those of his descendants, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans rose to become a powerful people, friendly with Elves, both of [[Eress\u00eba]] and of Middle-earth. The Elves of Eress\u00eba brought gifts  including skills and wonderful plants. Among these gifts were seven ''[[palant\u00edri]]'', magical orbs that could foresee the future, for the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\n===Sea-kings===\nN\u00famenor was surrounded by the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]], and the sea had a profound influence on N\u00famenor's culture and history. From the earliest times in its history, [[Fish as food|fish]] from the sea were a significant part of N\u00famen\u00f3rean diet; those providing this food were N\u00famenor's first sea-farers.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2 ch. 1 \"A Description of the Island of Numenor\"</ref> The N\u00famen\u00f3reans swiftly became skilled [[Shipbuilding|shipbuilders]] and [[Seafaring|mariners]], with a desire to explore and master the ocean. There was one limitation on this activity: the Ban of the Valar. When the island of N\u00famenor had been gifted to the Edain, they were strictly \"forbidden to sail west out of sight\" of the island. This was because the [[Undying Lands]], forbidden to mortals, lay tantalizingly not far west of N\u00famenor.\nSo the N\u00famen\u00f3reans began exploring the seas to the north, east and south. They reached [[Middle-earth]] to the east, and explored its coasts including the Eastern Sea on the far side of Middle-earth. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans brought the gifts of their superior civilization to the Men of Middle-earth, who called the N\u00famen\u00f3reans the Sea-kings.<ref name=\"R. Tolkien 1977 p. 263\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Akallab\u00eath]]\"</ref> News of N\u00famen\u00f3rean seafarers spread far inland in Middle-earth; even the reclusive [[Ents]] heard of the coming of \"the Great Ships\".<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', p. 76</ref>\nN\u00famen\u00f3reans had established good relations with [[Gil-galad]], the king of the High Elves of the northwest of Middle-earth, whose ships sailed from the Grey Havens.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2, ch. 2 \"Aldarion and Erendis\" </ref>\nAldarion founded the Uinendili, a guild of sea-farers, in honour of Uinen, goddess of the Sea.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', pp. 171 & 176</ref> He succeeded to the throne and became known as the Mariner-king. He established Vinyalond\u00eb (later called [[Lond Daer]]), the first N\u00famen\u00f3rean settlement in Middle-earth. This port provided access to the great forests of [[Eriador]], which the N\u00famen\u00f3reans needed for ship-building.\nThe N\u00famen\u00f3reans assisted Gil-galad in Middle-earth's War of the Elves and Sauron, which broke out after the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], in particular the [[One Ring]]. Tar-Minastir, later the eleventh King of N\u00famenor, assembled an armada, and sent it to Gil-galad's aid. The forces of N\u00famenor were without peer in war, and together with the Elves, they were able to temporarily defeat Sauron.\n\n===The Shadow looms===\nThe increasing power of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had a dark side; the exploitation of Middle-earth's forests had devastated large regions of Eriador. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans established further settlements in Middle-earth, coming to rule a coastal empire with no rival. At first they had engaged with the Men of Middle-earth in a friendly manner, but Minastir's successors, Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir 'the Great', became increasingly tyrannical, oppressing the Men of Middle-earth and exacting heavy tribute. \nThe N\u00famen\u00f3reans made [[Umbar]], the harbour-city in [[Harad|the south]] of Middle-earth, into a great fortress, and greatly expanded [[Pelargir]], a landing in [[Gondor]] near the Mouths of the [[Anduin]]. \nIncreasing numbers of N\u00famen\u00f3reans became jealous of Elves for their immortality, resenting the Ban of the Valar, and sought everlasting life. Those of this persuasion were the faction of \"King's Men\". \nThose who remained loyal to the Valar and friendly to the Elves (and using Elvish languages) were the \"Faithful\", also called the \"Elf-friends\" or ''Elendili''; they were led by the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. In the reign of Tar-Ancalimon (S.A. 2221-2386) the King's Men became dominant, and the Faithful became a persecuted minority accused of being \"spies of the Valar\". \n\n{{anchor|Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n}}\n===Sauron===\nLate in the Second Age, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the 25th monarch of N\u00famenor, sailed to Middle-earth to challenge [[Sauron]], known to the N\u00famen\u00f3reans as ''Zig\u00fbr'',<ref group=T>''[[Sauron Defeated]]''. pp. 250, 284, 437</ref> had claimed to be the King of Men and overlord of Middle-earth. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed at Umbar, but seeing the might of N\u00famenor, Sauron's armies fled, and Sauron surrendered without a fight. He was brought back to N\u00famenor as a prisoner, but he soon seduced the king and many other N\u00famen\u00f3reans, promising them eternal life if they worshipped his master Melkor. With Sauron as his advisor, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n had a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} tall temple erected in Armenelos, the capital. In this temple [[human sacrifice]]s were offered to Melkor. During this time, the White Tree Nimloth, which stood before the King's House in Armenelos and whose fate was  tied to the line of kings, was cut down and burned as a sacrifice to Melkor, at Sauron's direction. [[Isildur]] rescued a fruit of the tree which became an ancestor of the [[White Tree of Gondor]].\n\n===Cataclysm===\n[[File:Downfall of N\u00famenor.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|The Downfall of N\u00famenor and the Changing of the World.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=324-328}} The outlines of the continents are purely schematic.]]\n\nPrompted by Sauron and fearing old age and death, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n built a great armada and sailed into the West to make war upon the Valar, intending to seize the Undying Lands and achieve immortality. Sauron remained behind. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed on the shores of [[Aman (Tolkien)|Aman]]. As the Valar were forbidden to take direct action against Men, [[Manw\u00eb]], chief of the Valar, called upon [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], the One God.\nIn response, Eru caused the Changing of the World: the hitherto [[flat Earth]] was transformed into a globe, N\u00famenor sank beneath the ocean, <ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Foster |date=1978 |title=[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]] |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin|Unwin Paperbacks]] |chapter=Change of the World |ISBN=0-04-803001-5}}</ref> and the Undying Lands were removed from the Earth forever. The whole population on the island, except Sauron, was drowned. Most of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's armada, too, met their doom in the cataclysm. This was the second fall of Men, the first being when Men first awoke and fell swiftly under the dominion of Melkor.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\nSauron was caught in the cataclysm he had helped bring about. His body perished, and he could never again assume a fair form. He fled back to Middle-earth as a monstrous \"spirit of hatred borne upon a dark wind\", returning to [[Mordor]].<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 4 \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref>\n\nSome N\u00famen\u00f3reans had left the island before its destruction. Some survivors, the [[Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans]], continued to serve Sauron, whereas Elendil and the Faithful came to Middle-earth; Elendil's sons Isildur and An\u00e1rion founded the two Kingdoms in Exile: Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south. The two kingdoms endeavoured to maintain N\u00famen\u00f3rean culture. Gondor flourished, and \"for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of N\u00famenor\".<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 2 \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> Sauron gathered strength in nearby Mordor, setting the scene for a struggle lasting thousands of years. Gondor long defended the west against the threat of Sauron, but the seeds of Sauron's ultimate destruction lay in Arnor.\n\nThe Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, including [[Aragorn]], were directly descended from Isildur and An\u00e1rion, and therefore from the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.

In later centuries their chief industries were shipbuilding and seafaring, exploring the world in all directions save for the west, where the Ban of the Valar was in force. They often travelled to the shores of Middle-earth, teaching the men there the arts and crafts, and they introduced farming. The best mariners joined the Uinendili, who honoured Uinen, goddess of the Sea. The veneration of the sea was combined with the N\u00famen\u00f3reans' astronomical and chronological skills. Among their enhancements of the calendar, they standardized the day to begin when the sun rose out of the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Eastern Sea|eastern sea]], and they added a seventh day to the week, which they named ''E\u00e4renya'' (Quenya; Sindarin ''Oraearon''), meaning 'Sea-day'. They constructed great cities, towers, walls, harbours and highways, and bred great horses that roamed the open plains of Mittalmar. Emeri\u00eb, a district within Mittalmar, specialized in sheep.\n\n===Rituals===\nBefore the coming of the Shadow, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans maintained several traditions connected with the worship of [[Il\u00favatar]] and respect to the Valar. Among them are recorded the setting a bough of ''oiolair\u00eb'' upon the prow of a departing ship,<ref name=\"AE\" group=T/> the ceremonies concerned with the passing of the Sceptre, and laying down one's life. The most famous traditions were the Three Prayers, during which a great concourse of people ascended to the holy summit of Meneltarma and the King praised Eru Il\u00favatar. These were: the spring prayer for a good year, ''Erukyerm\u00eb''; the midsummer prayer for a good harves, ''Erulaital\u00eb''; and the autumn harvest thanksgiving, ''Eruhantal\u00eb''.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/> With the coming of the Shadow, many N\u00famen\u00f3reans turned away from Il\u00favatar and worshipped the evil Vala Morgoth with [[human sacrifice]] in a great temple in Armenelos.\n\n===Calendar===\n\nThe N\u00famen\u00f3rean calendar, the \"King's Reckoning\", is similar to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] with a week of seven days, a year of 365 days except in [[leap year]]s, and twelve months (''astar''): ten with 30 days and two with 31. However, King's Reckoning has some days outside the months, a feature borrowed from Elvish Calendars, which were generally holidays. Two of these were the pair which book-ends the year; thus the last month of the year was followed by ''mettar\u00eb'', the last day of the year; this was followed by ''yestar\u00eb'', New Year's Day, before the start of the first month. The other monthless day was ''lo\u00ebnd\u00eb'', mid-year day. In a leap year there were two mid-year days. In the Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the age. Various irregularities occur in this calendar, especially following the Downfall. Mardil Voronw\u00eb revised the calendar, and the new version became the \"Steward's Reckoning\": all the months had 30 days, with two additional \"extra\" days at the [[equinox]]es, ''tuil\u00e9r\u00eb'' and ''y\u00e1vi\u00e9r\u00eb''. The five extra days (the equinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\nThe Reunited Kingdom adopted a \"New Reckoning\", which began the year on March 25 (cf. [[Lady Day]], the English new year between [[A.D.]] 1155 and 1752), the date of the downfall of Sauron. This made it correspond more closely to the spring beginning of the Elven calendar.\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the D\u00fanedain):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Quenya name<ref name=\"RotK_Appendix D\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=Appendix D|Ref=Return of the King 1955}}</ref>\n!Sindarin name<ref name=\"RotK_Appendix D\" group=T/>\n!Meaning\n|'''[[French Republican calendar|French]]'''<ref name=\"Allan 1978 151\"/>\n|-\n|Narviny\u00eb || Narwain || new sun<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Salo|2004|loc=Appendix 6}}</ref> || ''[[Niv\u00f4se]]''<!--snowy-->\n|-\n|N\u00e9nim\u00eb || N\u00ednui || watery<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T/> || ''[[Pluvi\u00f4se]]''<!--rainy-->\n|-\n|S\u00falim\u00eb || Gwaeron || windy / wind month<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T/><ref name=\"Silm_Appendix, sul entry\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Silmarillion|loc=Appendix, s.v.

For him, the existence of ideas embodied in ancient words and names indicated that there must have been \"some original conception\",{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}} a once-living tradition, behind those ideas. The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] notes that in Tolkien's ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]'', the key names are from Germanic legend, and they speak of elves:{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Oswald || [[Valandil]]\n|}\n\nThese names formed for Tolkien the possibility of a kind of progression, from his long-lost mythical world of N\u00famenor, to his fantasy world of Middle-earth, also now lost, to the real ancient Germanic and Anglo-Saxon thousands of years later, and finally down to the modern world, where names like Edwin still survive, carrying for the knowledgeable philologist the shadow of a hint of a rich living English mythology. Shippey notes that in N\u00famenor, the mythology would have been still stronger, as being an Elf-friend, one of the hated ''Elendili'', marked a person out to the King's Men faction as a target for human sacrifice to Morgoth. Tolkien's \"continuous playing with names\" led to characters and situations, and sometimes to stories.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n[[C. S.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings. It was a large island in the Sundering Seas to the west of [[Middle-earth]], the main setting of Tolkien's writings, and was the greatest civilization of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. However, after centuries of prosperity many of the inhabitants ceased to worship the One God, [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], and rebelled against the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], resulting in the destruction of the island and the death of most of its people. Tolkien intended N\u00famenor to allude to the legendary [[Atlantis]].<ref name=\"Letters Atlantis\" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', ##131, 154, 156, 227.</ref>\n\nN\u00famenor first appeared in print in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set thousands of years after N\u00famenor's destruction. Within ''The Lord of the Rings'', N\u00famenor looms as a fabulous [[Lost city (fiction)|lost civilization]].\n\nAn unfinished story, ''[[Aldarion and Erendis]]'', is set in N\u00famenor at its [[zenith]]; another, ''[[Akallab\u00eath]]'', summarizes its downfall. The appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and several accounts published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series also touch upon it.\n\nOriginally intended to be a part of a time-travel story, Tolkien once saw the tale of the fall of N\u00famenor as a conclusion to his ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the \"last tale\" about the Elder Days.<ref name=\"LR1\" group=T>''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|Lost Road]]'', \"The early history of the legend\", pp. 7\u201310.</ref> Later, with the emergence of ''The Lord of the Rings'', it became the link between these two works and a major part of his [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]].\n\n==Fictional history==\n\n===Land of Gift===\n\nThe island of N\u00famenor was raised from the sea as a gift from the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] to the [[Edain]], the Fathers of Men who had stood with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Beleriand]] against [[Morgoth]] in the wars of the [[First Age]].

Under his rule, and those of his descendants, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans rose to become a powerful people, friendly with Elves, both of [[Eress\u00eba]] and of Middle-earth. The Elves of Eress\u00eba brought gifts  including skills and wonderful plants. Among these gifts were seven ''[[palant\u00edri]]'', magical orbs that could foresee the future, for the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\n===Sea-kings===\nN\u00famenor was surrounded by the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]], and the sea had a profound influence on N\u00famenor's culture and history. From the earliest times in its history, [[Fish as food|fish]] from the sea were a significant part of N\u00famen\u00f3rean diet; those providing this food were N\u00famenor's first sea-farers.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2 ch. 1 \"A Description of the Island of Numenor\"</ref> The N\u00famen\u00f3reans swiftly became skilled [[Shipbuilding|shipbuilders]] and [[Seafaring|mariners]], with a desire to explore and master the ocean. There was one limitation on this activity: the Ban of the Valar. When the island of N\u00famenor had been gifted to the Edain, they were strictly \"forbidden to sail west out of sight\" of the island. This was because the [[Undying Lands]], forbidden to mortals, lay tantalizingly not far west of N\u00famenor.\nSo the N\u00famen\u00f3reans began exploring the seas to the north, east and south. They reached [[Middle-earth]] to the east, and explored its coasts including the Eastern Sea on the far side of Middle-earth. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans brought the gifts of their superior civilization to the Men of Middle-earth, who called the N\u00famen\u00f3reans the Sea-kings.<ref name=\"R. Tolkien 1977 p. 263\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Akallab\u00eath]]\"</ref> News of N\u00famen\u00f3rean seafarers spread far inland in Middle-earth; even the reclusive [[Ents]] heard of the coming of \"the Great Ships\".<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', p. 76</ref>\nN\u00famen\u00f3reans had established good relations with [[Gil-galad]], the king of the High Elves of the northwest of Middle-earth, whose ships sailed from the Grey Havens.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2, ch. 2 \"Aldarion and Erendis\" </ref>\nAldarion founded the Uinendili, a guild of sea-farers, in honour of Uinen, goddess of the Sea.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', pp. 171 & 176</ref> He succeeded to the throne and became known as the Mariner-king. He established Vinyalond\u00eb (later called [[Lond Daer]]), the first N\u00famen\u00f3rean settlement in Middle-earth. This port provided access to the great forests of [[Eriador]], which the N\u00famen\u00f3reans needed for ship-building.\nThe N\u00famen\u00f3reans assisted Gil-galad in Middle-earth's War of the Elves and Sauron, which broke out after the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], in particular the [[One Ring]]. Tar-Minastir, later the eleventh King of N\u00famenor, assembled an armada, and sent it to Gil-galad's aid. The forces of N\u00famenor were without peer in war, and together with the Elves, they were able to temporarily defeat Sauron.\n\n===The Shadow looms===\nThe increasing power of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had a dark side; the exploitation of Middle-earth's forests had devastated large regions of Eriador. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans established further settlements in Middle-earth, coming to to rule a coastal empire with no rival. At first they had engaged with the Men of Middle-earth in a friendly manner, but Minastir's successors, Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir 'the Great', became increasingly tyrannical, oppressing the Men of Middle-earth and exacting heavy tribute. \nThe N\u00famen\u00f3reans made [[Umbar]], the harbour-city in [[Harad|the south]] of Middle-earth, into a great fortress, and greatly expanded [[Pelargir]], a landing in [[Gondor]] near the Mouths of the [[Anduin]]. \nIncreasing numbers of N\u00famen\u00f3reans became jealous of Elves for their immortality, resenting the Ban of the Valar, and sought everlasting life. Those of this persuasion were the faction of \"King's Men\". \nThose who remained loyal to the Valar and friendly to the Elves (and using Elvish languages) were the \"Faithful\", also called the \"Elf-friends\" or ''Elendili''; they were led by the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. In the reign of Tar-Ancalimon (S.A. 2221-2386) the King's Men became dominant, and the Faithful became a persecuted minority accused of being \"spies of the Valar\". \n\n{{anchor|Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n}}\n===Sauron===\nLate in the Second Age, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the 25th monarch of N\u00famenor, sailed to Middle-earth to challenge [[Sauron]], known to the N\u00famen\u00f3reans as ''Zig\u00fbr'',<ref group=T>''[[Sauron Defeated]]''. pp. 250, 284, 437</ref> had claimed to be the King of Men and overlord of Middle-earth. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed at Umbar, but seeing the might of N\u00famenor, Sauron's armies fled, and Sauron surrendered without a fight. He was brought back to N\u00famenor as a prisoner, but he soon seduced the king and many other N\u00famen\u00f3reans, promising them eternal life if they worshipped his master Melkor. With Sauron as his advisor, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n had a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} tall temple erected in Armenelos, the capital. In this temple [[human sacrifice]]s were offered to Melkor. During this time, the White Tree Nimloth, which stood before the King's House in Armenelos and whose fate was  tied to the line of kings, was cut down and burned as a sacrifice to Melkor, at Sauron's direction. [[Isildur]] rescued a fruit of the tree which became an ancestor of the [[White Tree of Gondor]].\n\n===Cataclysm===\n[[File:Downfall of N\u00famenor.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|The Downfall of N\u00famenor and the Changing of the World.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=324-328}} The outlines of the continents are purely schematic.]]\n\nPrompted by Sauron and fearing old age and death, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n built a great armada and sailed into the West to make war upon the Valar, intending to seize the Undying Lands and achieve immortality. Sauron remained behind. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed on the shores of [[Aman (Tolkien)|Aman]]. As the Valar were forbidden to take direct action against Men, [[Manw\u00eb]], chief of the Valar, called upon [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], the One God.\nIn response, Eru caused the Changing of the World: the hitherto [[flat Earth]] was transformed into a globe, N\u00famenor sank beneath the ocean, <ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Foster |date=1978 |title=[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]] |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin|Unwin Paperbacks]] |chapter=Change of the World |ISBN=0-04-803001-5}}</ref> and the Undying Lands were removed from the Earth forever. The whole population on the island, except Sauron, was drowned. Most of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's armada, too, met their doom in the cataclysm. This was the second fall of Men, the first being when Men first awoke and fell swiftly under the dominion of Melkor.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\nSauron was caught in the cataclysm he had helped bring about. His body perished, and he could never again assume a fair form. He fled back to Middle-earth as a monstrous \"spirit of hatred borne upon a dark wind\", returning to [[Mordor]].<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 4 \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref>\n\nSome N\u00famen\u00f3reans had left the island before its destruction. Some survivors, the [[Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans]], continued to serve Sauron, whereas Elendil and the Faithful came to Middle-earth; Elendil's sons Isildur and An\u00e1rion founded the two Kingdoms in Exile: Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south. The two kingdoms endeavoured to maintain N\u00famen\u00f3rean culture. Gondor flourished, and \"for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of N\u00famenor\".<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 2 \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> Sauron gathered strength in nearby Mordor, setting the scene for a struggle lasting thousands of years. Gondor long defended the west against the threat of Sauron, but the seeds of Sauron's ultimate destruction lay in Arnor.\n\nThe Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, including [[Aragorn]], were directly descended from Isildur and An\u00e1rion, and therefore from the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. The kings of Arnor inherited the silver rod of the Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb; this rod was renamed the Sceptre of Ann\u00faminas, and was the chief symbol of Arnor's kingship.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix A \u00a7I(iii) p. 323 footnote 1</ref> The Princes of Dol Amroth were descended from a family of The Faithful from N\u00famenor who had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the Second Age.

In later centuries their chief industries were shipbuilding and seafaring, exploring the world in all directions save for the west, where the Ban of the Valar was in force. They often travelled to the shores of Middle-earth, teaching the men there the arts and crafts, and they introduced farming. The best mariners joined the Uinendili, who honoured Uinen, goddess of the Sea. The veneration of the sea was combined with the N\u00famen\u00f3reans' astronomical and chronological skills. Among their enhancements of the calendar, they standardized the day to begin when the sun rose out of the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Eastern Sea|eastern sea]], and they added a seventh day to the week, which they named ''E\u00e4renya'' (Quenya; Sindarin ''Oraearon''), meaning 'Sea-day'. They constructed great cities, towers, walls, harbours and highways, and bred great horses that roamed the open plains of Mittalmar. Emeri\u00eb, a district within Mittalmar, specialized in sheep.\n\n===Rituals===\nBefore the coming of the Shadow, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans maintained several traditions connected with the worship of [[Il\u00favatar]] and respect to the Valar. Among them are recorded the setting a bough of ''oiolair\u00eb'' upon the prow of a departing ship,<ref name=\"AE\" group=T/> the ceremonies concerned with the passing of the Sceptre, and laying down one's life. The most famous traditions were the Three Prayers, during which a great concourse of people ascended to the holy summit of Meneltarma and the King praised Eru Il\u00favatar. These were: the spring prayer for a good year, ''Erukyerm\u00eb''; the midsummer prayer for a good harves, ''Erulaital\u00eb''; and the autumn harvest thanksgiving, ''Eruhantal\u00eb''.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/> With the coming of the Shadow, many N\u00famen\u00f3reans turned away from Il\u00favatar and worshipped the evil Vala Morgoth with [[human sacrifice]] in a great temple in Armenelos.\n\n===Calendar===\n\nThe N\u00famen\u00f3rean calendar, the \"King's Reckoning\", is similar to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] with a week of seven days, a year of 365 days except in [[leap year]]s, and twelve months (''astar''): ten with 30 days and two with 31. However, King's Reckoning has some days outside the months, a feature borrowed from Elvish Calendars, which were generally holidays. Two of these were the pair which book-ends the year; thus the last month of the year was followed by ''mettar\u00eb'', the last day of the year; this was followed by ''yestar\u00eb'', New Year's Day, before the start of the first month. The other monthless day was ''lo\u00ebnd\u00eb'', mid-year day. In a leap year there were two mid-year days. In the Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the age. Various irregularities occur in this calendar, especially following the Downfall. Mardil Voronw\u00eb revised the calendar, and the new version became the \"Steward's Reckoning\": all the months had 30 days, with two additional \"extra\" days at the [[equinox]]es, ''tuil\u00e9r\u00eb'' and ''y\u00e1vi\u00e9r\u00eb''. The five extra days (the equinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\nThe Reunited Kingdom adopted a \"New Reckoning\", which began the year on March 25 (cf. [[Lady Day]], the English new year between [[A.D.]] 1155 and 1752), the date of the downfall of Sauron. This made it correspond more closely to the spring beginning of the Elven calendar.\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the D\u00fanedain):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Quenya name<ref name=\"RotK_Appendix D\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=Appendix D|Ref=Return of the King 1955}}</ref>\n!Sindarin name<ref name=\"RotK_Appendix D\" group=T/>\n!Meaning\n|'''[[French Republican calendar|French]]'''<ref name=\"Allan 1978 151\"/>\n|-\n|Narviny\u00eb || Narwain || new sun<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Salo|2004|loc=Appendix 6}}</ref> || ''[[Niv\u00f4se]]''<!--snowy-->\n|-\n|N\u00e9nim\u00eb || N\u00ednui || watery<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T/> || ''[[Pluvi\u00f4se]]''<!--rainy-->\n|-\n|S\u00falim\u00eb || Gwaeron || windy / wind month<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T/><ref name=\"Silm_Appendix, sul entry\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Silmarillion|loc=Appendix, s.v.

For him, the existence of ideas embodied in ancient words and names indicated that there must have been \"some original conception\",{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}} a once-living tradition, behind those ideas. The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] notes that in Tolkien's ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]'', the key names are from Germanic legend, and they speak of elves:{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Germanic || [[Old English]] !! Meaning !! Modern name !! In N\u00famenor{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}}\n|-\n| [[Alboin]] || [[\u00c6lfwine]] || Elf-friend || Alwin, Elwin, Aldwin || [[Elendil]]\n|-\n| [[Audoin]] || [[Eadwine]] || Bliss-friend || Edwin || [[Herendil]]\n|-\n| \u2014 || Oswine || God-friend<br/>([[Valar]]-friend) || Oswin, cf. Oswald || [[Valandil]]\n|}\n\nThese names formed for Tolkien the possibility of a kind of progression, from his long-lost mythical world of N\u00famenor, to his fantasy world of Middle-earth, also now lost, to the real ancient Germanic and Anglo-Saxon thousands of years later, and finally down to the modern world, where names like Edwin still survive, carrying for the knowledgeable philologist the shadow of a hint of a rich living English mythology. Shippey notes that in N\u00famenor, the mythology would have been still stronger, as being an Elf-friend, one of the hated ''Elendili'', marked a person out to the King's Men faction as a target for human sacrifice to Morgoth. Tolkien's \"continuous playing with names\" led to characters and situations, and sometimes to stories.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=336-337}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n[[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1945 novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' makes reference to \"Numinor and the True West\", which Lewis credits as a then-unpublished creation of [[J. R. R.

The dynamic situation of the business movement spurred Pahala Kencana to continue to expand its marketing operations area to reach several large and small cities in [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Madura]], [[Bali]], and [[Lombok]]. In 1993, PK developed the Pahala Kencana Depository Services business, which initially only served destinations on the bus operating route, relied on the remaining passenger luggage space, and operated a few small vehicles as modes of delivery between goods. In the same year, PK established PT BPW Pahala Kencana Travel Bureau which later became better known as Pahala Tours & Travel. In 1997, PK operated a number of city bus fleets in Jakarta, and in 1998 Pahala Kencana resumed business by opening inter-city routes within the province (AKDP).\n\nIn 2000, PT Pahala Kencana began to expand into the field of tourism transportation transportation business which included the provision of tourism buses and rental vehicles under the Nirwana Luxury Tourist Bus brand. In the same year, Pahala Kencana moved its headquarters from [[Kudus, Indonesia|Kudus]], [[Central Java]] to [[Jakarta]].

The dynamic situation of the business movement spurred Pahala Kencana to continue to expand its marketing operations area to reach several large and small cities in [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Madura]], [[Bali]], and [[Lombok]]. In 1993, PK developed the Pahala Kencana Depository Services business, which initially only served destinations on the bus operating route, relied on the remaining passenger luggage space, and operated a few small vehicles as modes of delivery between goods. In the same year, PK established PT BPW Pahala Kencana Travel Bureau which later became better known as Pahala Tours & Travel. In 1997, PK operated a number of city bus fleets in Jakarta, and in 1998 Pahala Kencana resumed business by opening inter-city routes within the province (AKDP).\n\nIn 2000, PT Pahala Kencana began to expand into the field of tourism transportation transportation business which included the provision of tourism buses and rental vehicles under the Nirwana Luxury Tourist Bus brand. In the same year, Pahala Kencana moved its headquarters from [[Kudus, Indonesia|Kudus]], [[Central Java]] to [[Jakarta]]. Then in 2005, PT Pahala Kencana developed an airplane ticket sales business that concentrated on selling airline tickets at low rates by establishing PT Nata Tours.<ref>{{cite|url=https://ayonaikbis.com/sejarah-po-pahala-kencana/2995}}</ref>\n\n== Route ==\nPahala Kencana currently serves more than 93 cities in [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]] with the frequency of the main route commuting 86 times.
