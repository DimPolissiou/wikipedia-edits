He beat Jim Crawford there by getting a knockout in three rounds. Fitzsimmons had his first 28 definite professional fights in Australia, where he lost the [[List of Australian middleweight boxing champions|Australian Middleweight title]] to Mick Dooley (rumours spoke of a fixed bout) and where he also won a fight by [[knockout]] while on the floor: when Edward Starlight Robins dropped Fitzsimmons to the canvas in round nine of their fight, he also broke his hand and could not continue, therefore the referee declared Fitzsimmons the winner by a knockout.\n\nBy this stage, Fitzsimmons had established his own style. He developed a certain movement and caginess from one of the greatest bare-knuckle fighters, [[Jem Mace]]. Mace encouraged Fitzsimmons to develop his punching technique, drawing on the enormous power he had gained from blacksmithing. Fitzsimmons delivered short, accurate and occasionally conclusive punches. He soon built up a reputation as by far the hardest puncher in boxing.\n\n=== Winning the Middleweight title ===\nMoving on to the United States, Fitzsimmons fought four more times in 1890, winning three and drawing one.\n\n[[File:FitzsimmonsDempseyNOLAJan1891FB1.JPG|right|thumb|Fitzsimmons knocks down Dempsey in New Orleans, 1891]]\nThen, on 14 January 1891, in [[New Orleans]], he won his first world title from [[Jack (Nonpareil) Dempsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middlleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> Fitzsimmons knocked out Dempsey (from whom the later [[Jack Dempsey]] took his name) in the 13th round to become the World Middleweight Champion. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey down at least 13 times and by the finish left him in such a pitiable condition that he begged him to quit. Since Dempsey would not do so, Fitzsimmons knocked him out and then carried him to his corner. On 22 July, police broke off his fight with [[Jim Hall (boxer)|Jim Hall]] after he had knocked Hall down several times.\n\nFitzsimmons spent the next two years fighting non-title bouts and exhibitions until giving Hall a chance at the title in 1893. He retained the crown by a knockout in round four. He spent the rest of that year doing exhibitions, and on 2 June, he had scheduled a two-way exhibition where he would demonstrate in public how to hit the boxing bag and then how to box against a real opponent. Reportedly, two freak accidents happened that day: Fitzsimmons hit the bag so hard that it broke, and then his opponent of that day allegedly slipped, getting hit in the head and the boxing exhibition was cancelled.\n\nAt a public sparring performance on 16 November 1894 at Jacob's Opera House, Syracuse, New York, Fitzsimmons knocked out sparring partner Con Riordan, who was carried off unconscious and died several hours later. Two months later Fitzsimmons was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted.<ref>Toronto Star, 19 January 1895.</ref>\n\n===Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey===\n{{main|Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey}}\nAfter vacating the Middleweight title, Fitzsimmons began campaigning at [[heavyweight]] (the [[light heavyweight]] division did not exist at that time). On 2 December 1896, the [[San Francisco Athletic Club]] sponsored a fight at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco between Fitzsimmons and [[Tom Sharkey]]. Unable to find a referee, they called on former lawman [[Wyatt Earp]]. He had officiated 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]].<ref name=reilly>{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Joe |title=Born To Uphold The Law: Frank Sulloway\u2019s Principles Applied to the Earp-Clanton Feud of 1879\u20131882 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |publisher=Drexel E-Repository and Archive |accessdate=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712215527/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favoured to win, and bets flowed heavily his way. Earp entered the ring still armed with his customary Colt .45 and drew a lot of attention when he had to be disarmed. He later said he forgot he was wearing it. Fitzsimmons was taller and quicker than Sharkey and dominated the fight from the opening bell. In the eighth round, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famed \"solar plexus punch,\" an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless.

He out-boxed Fitzsimmons for several rounds, knocked him down in the sixth round and badly damaged his face with his jab, left hook and right hand, but Fitzsimmons kept coming and Corbett began to tire. In the 14th round, Fitzsimmons won the title with his \"solar plexus\" punch. Corbett collapsed in agony. Fitzsimmons' \"solar plexus\" punch became legendary, although he himself may never have used the phrase. The entire fight was filmed by [[Enoch J. Rector]] and released to cinemas as ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', the longest film ever released at the time. Using her maiden name, it was covered by [[Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis]], the first woman to report a prize fight.<ref name=\"unr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/bios/women/davis.htm|title=Nellie Mighels Davis|work=Nevada Women's History Project|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nFitzsimmons spent the rest of 1897 and 1898 doing stage tours.{{clarify|date=October 2014}} In 1899, Fitzsimmons fought [[James J. Jeffries]] at the Coney Island Athletic Club near Brooklyn, New York. Most people gave Jeffries little chance, even though at over 15 stones (95&nbsp;kg) he massively outweighed his opponent and was far younger, but Jeffries lifted the World Heavyweight Championship from Fitzsimmons with an 11th-round knockout.\n\nIn June 1901 Fitzsimmons took part in a [[wrestling]] match against Gus Ruhlin. He lost and went back to boxing. He then enjoyed legitimate boxing knockouts of leading contenders Ruhlin and [[Tom Sharkey]].\n\nIn 1901 he published a book ''Physical Culture and Self-Defense'' (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, but he kept going until his enormous strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight.\n\n=== Winning the Light Heavyweight title ===\nIn November 1903, Fitzsimmons made history by defeating World Light Heavyweight Champion [[George Gardiner (boxer)|George Gardiner]] (also known as Gardner) by a decision in 20 rounds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> becoming the first boxer to win titles in three weight-divisions.<ref name=ADP/>\n\nSoon afterward, he went back to the Heavyweights, where he kept fighting until 1914, with mixed results. In 1907 at age 44, Fitzsimmons fought much younger [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], during the time period in which reigning champion [[James J. Jeffries]] refused to fight Johnson. The bout between Johnson and Fitzsimmons ended in victory for Johnson with a second round [[knockout]].<ref name=Burns>Ken Burns, ''Unforgivable Blackness''</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAlthough Fitzsimmons became a world champion in each of the Middleweight, Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight divisions, historians do ''not'' consider him the first world Light Heavyweight Champion to become World Heavyweight Champion, because he won the Heavyweight title before winning the Light Heavyweight belt. [[Michael Spinks]] counts as the first Light Heavyweight World Champion to win the Heavyweight belt as well. However, Fitzsimmons was the first Middleweight Champion to win the Heavyweight title and the only Heavyweight Champion to drop down and win the Light Heavyweight title. Fitzsimmons and later [[Henry Armstrong]] were the only men to win undisputed world championships in three different weight classes.\n\nFitzsimmons had a final professional record of 66 wins with 59 by knockout, 8 losses, 4 draws, 19 no contests and 2 no decisions (Newspaper Decisions: 2\u20130\u20130).\n\nFitzsimmons's exact record remains unknown, as the boxing world often kept records poorly during his era, but Fitzsimmons said he had had more than 350 fights (which could have involved exaggeration on his part).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}) It's also possible that Bob may have included his many exhibition bouts in his total.\n\n==Death and Legacy==\nFitzsimmons died of [[pneumonia]] on 22 October 1917 in Chicago, survived by his fourth wife. His grave lies in the [[Graceland Cemetery]], [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]]. Having four wives, a gambling habit and a susceptibility to confidence tricksters, he did not hold on to the money he made.\n\nThe statue ''Peace'' on the [[Dewey Arch]] was modelled on Fitzsimmons by the sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A statue of Fitzsimmons has also stood in the city centre of Timaru, New Zealand, since 1987. It was commissioned by New Zealand millionaire boxing fan [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]] and sculpted by [[Margriet Windhausen]].<ref>Romanos, J. \"[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/37951/statue-of-bob-fitzsimmons-timaru Statue of Bob Fitzsimmons, Timaru]\", ''[[Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', 27 January 2015. Retrieved 10 December 2016.</ref>\n\nThe [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] has made Fitzsimmons a member in its \"Old Timer\" category.\n\nIn 2003 ''[[Ring Magazine]]'' named Fitzsimmons number eight of all time among boxing's best punchers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\nFitzsimmons married four times and had six children, four of whom survived infancy.<ref>http://www.fitzsimmons.co.nz/html/genealogy.html</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|draws=14\n|nc=9\n|ko-wins=79\n|ko-losses=7\n|dec-wins=10\n|dec-losses=4\n|dq-wins=0\n|dq-losses=1\n}}\n{{clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|125\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|90\u201312\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Jersey Bellew\n|NWS\n|6\n|20 Feb 1914\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Municipal Hall,[[South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|South Bethlehem]], Pennsylvania, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|124\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|89\u201312\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Dan Sweeney\n|NWS\n|6\n|29 Jan 1914\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Athletic Club, [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], Pennyslvania, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|123\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|88\u201312\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Bill Lang]]\n|KO\n|12 (20)\n|27 Dec 1909\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|AUS}} {{small|[[Sydney Stadium]], Sydney, Australia}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|For [[List of Australian heavyweight boxing champions|Australian heavyweight title]]}}\n|-\n|122\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|88\u201311\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]\n|KO\n|2 (6)\n|17 Jul 1907\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Washington Sports Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|121\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|88\u201310\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Charlie Haghey\n|KO\n|4 (6)\n|31 Jan 1906\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Webster, Massachusetts|Webster]], Massachusetts, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|120\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|87\u201310\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Philadelphia Jack O'Brien]]\n|RTD\n|13 (20)\n|20 Dec 1905\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Mechanic's Pavilion, San Francisco, California, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Lost lineal light-heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|119\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|87\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Philadelphia Jack O'Brien]]\n|NWS\n|6, {{small|1:22}}\n|23 Jul 1904\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Baker Bowl]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|118\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|86\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[George Gardiner (boxer)|George Gardiner]]\n|PTS\n|20\n|25 Nov 1903\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Mechanic's Pavilion, San Francisco, California, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Won [[List of world light-heavyweight boxing champions|lineal light-heavyweight title]]}}\n|-\n|117\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|85\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Joe Grim]]\n|NWS\n|6\n|14 Oct 1903\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Southern Athletic Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|116\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|84\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|IRE}} Con Coughlin\n|TKO\n|1 (6), {{small|2:52}}\n|30 Sep 1903\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Washington Sporting Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|115\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|83\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Mike Ranke\n|KO\n|2 (4), {{small|0:15}}\n|27 Dec 1902\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]], Montana, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|114\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|82\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Steward\n|KO\n|1 (4)\n|19 Dec 1902\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Butte, Montana]], U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|113\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|81\u20139\u201314 {{small|(9)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[James J.

He wanted to join the crew of the ''Isabella Ridley'', and do some service as a sailor, hoping that it would toughen him up for a career in boxing, but the ship was badly damaged in storms while still docked in Timaru.<ref>Nicholson 2011, p. 45.</ref> Instead, he took on a range of jobs; as a butcher's delivery boy, a carriage painter, striker at an iron foundry, and a decorator, before becoming an apprentice at his family's blacksmith's forge with his brother Jarrett. His time working in the blacksmith's forge helped to develop his upper body, particularly his arms and shoulders.<ref name=\"odnb\"/><ref name=\"teara\"/> During his time working in the blacksmith's forge, there are stories that Fitzsimmons was not averse to fighting quarrelsome, often drunk, customers, and it was suggested that this even boosted business, as customers returned to the forge, hoping to see a fight.<ref>Nicholson 2011, p. 46.</ref>\n\n== Amateur career ==\nIn the early 1880s [[Jem Mace]], an English bare-knuckle boxer, travelled to New Zealand, and Timaru hosted both his boxing school, and the first boxing championships held in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/boxing-and-wrestling/page-1 |title=Boxing and wrestling \u2013 Professional boxing |last=Romanos |first=Joseph |website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> Fitzsimmons entered the tournament, and knocked out four opponents on his way to winning the competition.

He beat Jim Crawford there by getting a knockout in three rounds. Fitzsimmons had his first 28 definite professional fights in Australia, where he lost the [[List of Australian middleweight boxing champions|Australian Middleweight title]] to Mick Dooley (rumours spoke of a fixed bout) and where he also won a fight by [[knockout]] while on the floor: when Edward Starlight Robins dropped Fitzsimmons to the canvas in round nine of their fight, he also broke his hand and could not continue, therefore the referee declared Fitzsimmons the winner by a knockout.\n\nBy this stage, Fitzsimmons had established his own style. He developed a certain movement and caginess from one of the greatest bare-knuckle fighters, [[Jem Mace]]. Mace encouraged Fitzsimmons to develop his punching technique, drawing on the enormous power he had gained from blacksmithing. Fitzsimmons delivered short, accurate and occasionally conclusive punches. He soon built up a reputation as by far the hardest puncher in boxing.\n\n=== Winning the Middleweight title ===\nMoving on to the United States, Fitzsimmons fought four more times in 1890, winning three and drawing one.\n\n[[File:FitzsimmonsDempseyNOLAJan1891FB1.JPG|right|thumb|Fitzsimmons knocks down Dempsey in New Orleans, 1891]]\nThen, on 14 January 1891, in [[New Orleans]], he won his first world title from [[Jack (Nonpareil) Dempsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middlleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> Fitzsimmons knocked out Dempsey (from whom the later [[Jack Dempsey]] took his name) in the 13th round to become the World Middleweight Champion. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey down at least 13 times and by the finish left him in such a pitiable condition that he begged him to quit. Since Dempsey would not do so, Fitzsimmons knocked him out and then carried him to his corner. On 22 July, police broke off his fight with [[Jim Hall (boxer)|Jim Hall]] after he had knocked Hall down several times.\n\nFitzsimmons spent the next two years fighting non-title bouts and exhibitions until giving Hall a chance at the title in 1893. He retained the crown by a knockout in round four. He spent the rest of that year doing exhibitions, and on 2 June, he had scheduled a two-way exhibition where he would demonstrate in public how to hit the boxing bag and then how to box against a real opponent. Reportedly, two freak accidents happened that day: Fitzsimmons hit the bag so hard that it broke, and then his opponent of that day allegedly slipped, getting hit in the head and the boxing exhibition was cancelled.\n\nAt a public sparring performance on 16 November 1894 at Jacob's Opera House, Syracuse, New York, Fitzsimmons knocked out sparring partner Con Riordan, who was carried off unconscious and died several hours later. Two months later Fitzsimmons was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted.<ref>Toronto Star, 19 January 1895.</ref>\n\n===Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey===\n{{main|Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey}}\nAfter vacating the Middleweight title, Fitzsimmons began campaigning at [[heavyweight]] (the [[light heavyweight]] division did not exist at that time). On 2 December 1896, the [[San Francisco Athletic Club]] sponsored a fight at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco between Fitzsimmons and [[Tom Sharkey]]. Unable to find a referee, they called on former lawman [[Wyatt Earp]]. He had officiated 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]].<ref name=reilly>{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Joe |title=Born To Uphold The Law: Frank Sulloway\u2019s Principles Applied to the Earp-Clanton Feud of 1879\u20131882 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |publisher=Drexel E-Repository and Archive |accessdate=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712215527/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favoured to win, and bets flowed heavily his way. Earp entered the ring still armed with his customary Colt .45 and drew a lot of attention when he had to be disarmed. He later said he forgot he was wearing it. Fitzsimmons was taller and quicker than Sharkey and dominated the fight from the opening bell. In the eighth round, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famed \"solar plexus punch,\" an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. The punch caught Sharkey, Earp, and most of the crowd by surprise, and Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screamed foul.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barra|first=Alan|title=BACKTALK;When Referee Wyatt Earp Laid Down the Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/sports/backtalk-when-referee-wyatt-earp-laid-down-the-law.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 November 1995}}</ref>\n\nEarp stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey when he was down.

He out-boxed Fitzsimmons for several rounds, knocked him down in the sixth round and badly damaged his face with his jab, left hook and right hand, but Fitzsimmons kept coming and Corbett began to tire. In the 14th round, Fitzsimmons won the title with his \"solar plexus\" punch. Corbett collapsed in agony. Fitzsimmons' \"solar plexus\" punch became legendary, although he himself may never have used the phrase. The entire fight was filmed by [[Enoch J. Rector]] and released to cinemas as ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', the longest film ever released at the time. Using her maiden name, it was covered by [[Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis]], the first woman to report a prize fight.<ref name=\"unr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/bios/women/davis.htm|title=Nellie Mighels Davis|work=Nevada Women's History Project|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nFitzsimmons spent the rest of 1897 and 1898 doing stage tours.{{clarify|date=October 2014}} In 1899, Fitzsimmons fought [[James J. Jeffries]] at the Coney Island Athletic Club near Brooklyn, New York. Most people gave Jeffries little chance, even though at over 15 stones (95&nbsp;kg) he massively outweighed his opponent and was far younger, but Jeffries lifted the World Heavyweight Championship from Fitzsimmons with an 11th-round knockout.\n\nIn June 1901 Fitzsimmons took part in a [[wrestling]] match against Gus Ruhlin. He lost and went back to boxing. He then enjoyed legitimate boxing knockouts of leading contenders Ruhlin and [[Tom Sharkey]].\n\nIn 1901 he published a book ''Physical Culture and Self-Defense'' (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, but he kept going until his enormous strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight.\n\n=== Winning the Light Heavyweight title ===\nIn November 1903, Fitzsimmons made history by defeating World Light Heavyweight Champion [[George Gardiner (boxer)|George Gardiner]] (also known as Gardner) by a decision in 20 rounds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> becoming the first boxer to win titles in three weight-divisions.<ref name=ADP/>\n\nSoon afterward, he went back to the Heavyweights, where he kept fighting until 1914, with mixed results. In 1907 at age 44, Fitzsimmons fought much younger [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], during the time period in which reigning champion [[James J. Jeffries]] refused to fight Johnson. The bout between Johnson and Fitzsimmons ended in victory for Johnson with a second round [[knockout]].<ref name=Burns>Ken Burns, ''Unforgivable Blackness''</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAlthough Fitzsimmons became a world champion in each of the Middleweight, Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight divisions, historians do ''not'' consider him the first world Light Heavyweight Champion to become World Heavyweight Champion, because he won the Heavyweight title before winning the Light Heavyweight belt. [[Michael Spinks]] counts as the first Light Heavyweight World Champion to win the Heavyweight belt as well. However, Fitzsimmons was the first Middleweight Champion to win the Heavyweight title and the only Heavyweight Champion to drop down and win the Light Heavyweight title. Fitzsimmons and later [[Henry Armstrong]] were the only men to win undisputed world championships in three different weight classes.\n\nFitzsimmons had a final professional record of 66 wins with 59 by knockout, 8 losses, 4 draws, 19 no contests and 2 no decisions (Newspaper Decisions: 2\u20130\u20130).\n\nFitzsimmons's exact record remains unknown, as the boxing world often kept records poorly during his era, but Fitzsimmons said he had had more than 350 fights (which could have involved exaggeration on his part).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}) It's also possible that Bob may have included his many exhibition bouts in his total.\n\n==Death and Legacy==\nFitzsimmons died of [[pneumonia]] on 22 October 1917 in Chicago, survived by his fourth wife. His grave lies in the [[Graceland Cemetery]], [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]]. Having four wives, a gambling habit and a susceptibility to confidence tricksters, he did not hold on to the money he made.\n\nThe statue ''Peace'' on the [[Dewey Arch]] was modelled on Fitzsimmons by the sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A statue of Fitzsimmons has also stood in the city centre of Timaru, New Zealand, since 1987. It was commissioned by New Zealand millionaire boxing fan [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]] and sculpted by [[Margriet Windhausen]].<ref>Romanos, J. \"[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/37951/statue-of-bob-fitzsimmons-timaru Statue of Bob Fitzsimmons, Timaru]\", ''[[Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', 27 January 2015.

It stars  [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], and [[Michael Caine]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of [[astronaut]]s who travel through a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]] in search of a new home for humanity.\n\nBrothers Christopher and [[Jonathan Nolan]] wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced ''Interstellar'' with his wife, [[Emma Thomas]], through their production company [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]], and with [[Lynda Obst]] through [[Lynda Obst Productions]]. [[Caltech]] theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]] was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, ''[[The Science of Interstellar]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Legendary Pictures]] co-financed the film. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] shot it on [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] in [[anamorphic format]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 70 mm]]. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[Iceland]] and [[Los Angeles]]. ''Interstellar'' uses extensive practical and [[miniature effect]]s and the company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] created additional [[Visual effect|digital effects]].\n\n''Interstellar'' premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on [[film stock]], expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million, making it the [[2014 in film|tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014]]. ''Interstellar'' received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, acting, and ambition. At the [[87th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words -->\nIn 2067, crop [[blight]]s and [[dust storm]]s threaten [[Human extinction|humanity's survival]]. Corn is the last viable crop. The world has also regressed into a [[Post-truth politics|post-truth]] society where younger generations are taught ideas such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] moon missions [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|were faked]]. Widowed engineer and former [[NASA]] pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom; and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy. After a storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear on Murphy's bedroom floor; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Murphy initially believes the patterns to be [[Morse code]]. However, Cooper eventually deduces that [[gravity]] variations caused the patterns and are a binary code for geographic coordinates. Cooper, accompanied by Murphy, who hides inside the truck, follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened elsewhere. Forty-eight years earlier, unknown beings positioned a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]], opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a [[black hole]] named ''Gargantua''. Twelve volunteers (the Lazarus astronauts) traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel a mass exodus; utilizing gravity to 'jettison' artificial habitat stations into orbit and beyond. Plan B involves launching the ''Endurance'' spacecraft carrying 5,000 [[Cryopreservation|frozen]] human embryos to colonize a [[habitable planet]].\n\nAfter some persuasion, Cooper is recruited to pilot the ''Endurance'' by Professor Brand. The crew includes scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and CASE. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murphy his wristwatch to compare their [[relative time]] for when he returns. Murphy is upset that her father is leaving her because Cooper does not even know when he will be back to earth. Cooper mentions to Murphy that by the time he gets back to earth, Cooper and Murphy may be the same age. After traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the black hole while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a landing craft to investigate Miller's planet, an [[ocean world]]. The plan is to descend into the planet and get out as fast as possible. This is because of time dilation and every hour on the Miller's planet is 7 years on Earth. If the crew spends too much time on Miller's planet, too much time may pass and everyone would die on Earth. After finding wreckage from Miller's ship, a tidal wave as huge as a mountain kills Doyle and delays the lander's departure. Due to the proximity of the black hole, time is [[gravitational time dilation|severely dilated]]. As a result, 23 years and 4 months have elapsed for Romilly on ''Endurance'' by the time Cooper and Brand return a few hours later.\n\nWith the ''Endurance'' having only enough fuel to reach one planet, the crew debates on whether to go to Edmunds' planet, which has slightly better [[telemetry]], or Mann's planet, which is still sending positive data. Brand wants to go to Edmunds' planet, but Cooper claims she wants to go there only because she is in love with Edmunds. Cooper chooses Mann's planet. On Mann's planet, the ''Endurance'' crew revive him from [[cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryostasis]]. Meanwhile, Murphy, now a scientist, transmits a message announcing Professor Brand has died. She has learned that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable. Plan B was always Professor Brand's only option. The reason Professor Brand lied about Plan A being viable is to give everyone hope. Murphy accuses Amelia and Cooper of knowing those left on Earth were doomed. Mann's frozen planet is uninhabitable; he had sent falsified data in order to be rescued. Mann attempts to murder Cooper, then escapes in a lander and heads for ''Endurance''.  Romilly is killed by Mann's explosive booby trap and Amelia and Cooper race to the ''Endurance'' in another lander. Mann dies during a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging ''Endurance''. The explosion causes the ''Endurance'' to spin and slowly descend into Mann's planet, but Cooper regains control after a difficult docking Maneuver. However, the ''Endurance'' has drifted too close to Gargantua and has been caught in its' gravitational pull.\n\n[[File:Black hole Interstellar.png|thumb|227px|right|Miller's planet orbiting ''Gargantua'']]\n\nWith insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, Cooper and Amelia plan to use a [[Gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] by using Gargantua's gravity to propel them towards Edmund's planet. However, being so close to Gargantua's gravity, time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper tricks Amelia by ejecting himself and TARS  to shed weight to ensure the ''Endurance'' reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the [[event horizon]] of ''Gargantua'', Cooper and TARS eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive [[tesseract]], possibly constructed by future humans. Across different time periods, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Cooper realizes he was Murphy's \"ghost\" and manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, using [[Morse code]] to transmit the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon. Cooper and TARS are ejected from the tesseract. Cooper awakens on a [[space habitat]] orbiting Saturn, where he reunites with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy solved the gravitational propulsion theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's exodus and survival. Nearing death and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return to Amelia. Cooper, who is now 124 years old, along with TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Amelia and CASE, who have begun to colonize Edmunds' planet. In the ending scene, Amelia can be seen crouching over a burial grave made with the identification plaque from Edmunds' cryo-capsule. She removes her [[space suit]]'s helmet, breathing the air of humanity's eventual new planet.\n\n==Cast==\n\n<!-- See the talk page before making changes to the listed cast. -->\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Joseph Cooper (referred only to as \"Cooper\" or \"Coop\" in the film), a widowed [[NASA]] pilot who, as the agency was closed by the [[Federal government of the United States |government of the US]], has retired to become a farmer.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Amelia Brand, a NASA astronaut and scientist.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Murphy Cooper, Joseph's younger daughter, who eventually becomes a Plan A scientist at NASA.\n** [[Mackenzie Foy]] as young Murphy\n** [[Ellen Burstyn]] as old Murphy\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mann, a NASA astronaut sent on an icy planet during the Lazarus program.\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Donald, Cooper's elderly father-in-law.\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Professor Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper and father of Amelia.\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Tom Cooper, Joseph's eldest son, who eventually grows up to become an egoist father.\n** [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as young Tom\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member and ''Endurance'' crew member.\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as TARS {{small|(voice and puppetry)}} and CASE {{small|(puppetry)}}\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as CASE {{small|(voice)}}\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Getty\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Romilly, another high-ranking NASA member and ''Endurance'' crewmember.\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Lois, Tom's wife.\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as School Principal\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Ms. Hanley\n* [[William Devane]] as Williams\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as Administrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Christopher Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Director, producer, writer\n* [[Jonathan Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Writer\n* [[Emma Thomas]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Lynda Obst]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Hoyte van Hoytema]]&nbsp;\u2013 Cinematographer\n* [[Nathan Crowley]]&nbsp;\u2013 Production designer\n* [[Mary Zophres]]&nbsp;\u2013 Costume designer\n* [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 Editor\n* [[Hans Zimmer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Music composer\n* [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Visual effects supervisor\n* [[Kip Thorne]]&nbsp;\u2013 Consultant, executive producer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Development and financing===\nThe premise for ''Interstellar'' was conceived by producer [[Lynda Obst]] and theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]], who collaborated on the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and had known each other since [[Carl Sagan]] set them up on a blind date.<ref name=\"jolin\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> The two conceived of a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,\" and attracted filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]]'s interest in directing.<ref name=\"Fernandez-Mar2007\" /> The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne.

The Ranger's function is similar to the [[Space Shuttle]]'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The ''Endurance'', the crew's [[mother ship]], has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules&nbsp;\u2014 four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the ''Endurance'' was based on the [[International Space Station]]: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need back-up systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with colonization equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"<ref name=\"jolin\" />\n\nThe film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and chose a {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} [[quadrilateral]] design. The director said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines&nbsp;\u2014 those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Actor [[Bill Irwin]] voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor [[Josh Stewart]]'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> The human space habitats resemble [[O'Neill cylinder]]s, a theoretical space colony model proposed by physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] in 1976.<ref name=\"GQ-Oct2014\" />\n\n===Sound design and music===\n{{Main|Interstellar (soundtrack)}}\n[[Gregg Landaker]] and [[Gary Rizzo]] were the film's [[audio engineer]]s tasked with [[audio mixing]], while sound editor [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]] supervised the process.<ref name=\"Desowitz-Sep2014\" /> Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment<ref name=\"Hammond-Mar2014\" /> and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.<ref name=\"jensen\" /> The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the [[subwoofer]] channel.\"<ref name=\"InterstellarMovie\" /> Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.<ref name=\"McClintock-Nov2014\" />\n\nComposer [[Hans Zimmer]], who scored Nolan's Batman film trilogy and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), returned to score ''Interstellar''. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film's music, but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the ''Interstellar'' soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that a 1926 four-manual [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ would be the primary instrument for the score.<ref name=\"Lubin-Nov2014\" /><ref name=\"Kilkenny\" /> Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for ''Interstellar'', three times more than for ''Inception''. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.<ref name=\"jensen\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], which worked on ''Inception'', was brought back for ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"Giardina-Jun2014\" /> According to visual effects supervisor [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]], the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012) or ''Inception''. However, for ''Interstellar'' they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of [[Chroma key|green screens]].<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 \u00d7 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.<ref name=\"VFXshots\" />\n\nThe Ranger, ''Endurance'', and Lander spacecraft were created using [[miniature effect]]s by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. [[3D printing|3D printed]] and hand sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th scale miniature of the ''Endurance'' module spanned over {{convert|7.6|m|abbr=on}}, while a [[pyrotechnic]] model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}, respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis [[gimbal]] on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using [[VistaVision]] cameras on a smaller motion control rig.<ref name=\"EmanuelLevy-Oct2014\" /> New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.<ref name=\"VFXshots\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe director was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982),<ref name=\"EW-Apr2013\" /> ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"Empire-Oct2014\" /> [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,<ref name=\"Mueller-Oct2014\" /> who also compared ''Interstellar'' to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948) as a film about human nature.<ref name=\"Jensen-Oct2014\" /> He sought to emulate films like [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983) for the crew before production,<ref name=\"jolin\" /> following in its example by capturing reflections on the ''Interstellar'' astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut [[Marsha Ivins]] to the set.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker [[Toni Myers]] for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.<ref name=\"Space-Nov2014\" /> [[Clark Kent]]'s upbringing in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.<ref name=\"marlow\"/> Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n==Scientific accuracy==\n[[File:Kip S. Thorne EM1B8790 (24027017497).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kip Thorne]], a theoretical physicist, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.]]\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole\u2014so what you see is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] [[Einstein field equations|equations]].\"<ref name=\"ThorneWormhole\" /> Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" /> At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.<ref name=\"NPR-Nov2014\" /> According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" />\n\nAstrobiologist [[David Grinspoon]] criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.<ref name=\"MotherJones-Nov2014\" /> [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], explored the science behind the ending of ''Interstellar'', concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it.\"<ref name=\"Gray\" /> Theoretical physicist [[Michio Kaku]] praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said ''Interstellar'' \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come.\" Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former NASA [[software engineer]], said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent.\"<ref name=\"Mashable\" />\n\n===Wormholes and black holes===\nTo create the wormhole and a [[rotating black hole|rotating]], [[supermassive black hole]] (possessing an [[ergosphere]], as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced [[Theoretical Physics|theoretical equations]] to the engineers, who then wrote new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the [[gravitational lensing]] caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 [[terabyte]]s of data.<ref name=\"wired\" /> The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and [[accretion disk]]s surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three [[scientific papers]].<ref name=\"IOP-Feb2015\" /><ref name=\"AJP-Jun2015\" /><ref name=\"ACM-Jul2015\" />\n\nChristopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the [[Doppler effect]] which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.<ref name=\"NewScientist-Feb2015\" /> Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/|title=Video Interview for WIRED|last=|first=|date=2014|website=WIRED|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818004138/http://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5446f00e61646d41b4130000/d9013528-b384-4abf-b3a3-236b905daaf3high.webm|archive-date=2015|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Space.com]], the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.<ref name=\"Wall-Nov2014\" /> Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature\u2014about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough [[gamma radiation]] and [[X-ray]]s to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.<ref name=\"InsideScience-Nov2015\" /> ''Futura-Sciences'' praised the correct depiction of the [[Penrose process]].<ref name=\"FX-Jan2016\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nThe teaser trailer for ''Interstellar'' debuted {{nowrap|December 13}}, 2013, and featured clips related to [[space exploration]], accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character Coop.<ref name=\"McIntyre-Dec2013\" /> The theatrical trailer debuted {{nowrap|May 5}}, 2014, at the [[Lockheed Martin]] IMAX Theater in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was made available online later that month.

It stars  [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], and [[Michael Caine]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of [[astronaut]]s who travel through a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]] in search of a new home for humanity.\n\nBrothers Christopher and [[Jonathan Nolan]] wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced ''Interstellar'' with his wife, [[Emma Thomas]], through their production company [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]], and with [[Lynda Obst]] through [[Lynda Obst Productions]]. [[Caltech]] theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]] was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, ''[[The Science of Interstellar]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Legendary Pictures]] co-financed the film. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] shot it on [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] in [[anamorphic format]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 70 mm]]. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[Iceland]] and [[Los Angeles]]. ''Interstellar'' uses extensive practical and [[miniature effect]]s and the company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] created additional [[Visual effect|digital effects]].\n\n''Interstellar'' premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on [[film stock]], expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million, making it the [[2014 in film|tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014]]. ''Interstellar'' received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, acting, and ambition. At the [[87th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words -->\nIn 2067, crop [[blight]]s and [[dust storm]]s threaten [[Human extinction|humanity's survival]]. Corn is the last viable crop. The world has also regressed into a [[Post-truth politics|post-truth]] society where younger generations are taught ideas such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] moon missions [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|were faked]]. Widowed engineer and former [[NASA]] pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom; and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy. After a storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear on Murphy's bedroom floor; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Murphy initially believes the patterns to be [[Morse code]]. However, Cooper eventually deduces that [[gravity]] variations caused the patterns and are a binary code for geographic coordinates. Cooper, accompanied by Murphy, who hides inside the truck, follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened elsewhere. Forty-eight years earlier, unknown beings positioned a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]], opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a [[black hole]] named ''Gargantua''. Twelve volunteers (the Lazarus astronauts) traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel a mass exodus; utilizing gravity to 'jettison' artificial habitat stations into orbit and beyond. Plan B involves launching the ''Endurance'' spacecraft carrying 5,000 [[Cryopreservation|frozen]] human embryos to colonize a [[habitable planet]].\n\nAfter some persuasion, Cooper is recruited to pilot the ''Endurance'' by Professor Brand. The crew includes scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and CASE. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murphy his wristwatch to compare their [[relative time]] for when he returns. Murphy is upset that her father is leaving her because Cooper does not even know when he will be back to earth. Cooper mentions to Murphy that by the time he gets back to earth, Cooper and Murphy may be the same age. After traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the black hole while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a landing craft to investigate Miller's planet, an [[ocean world]]. The plan is to descend into the planet and get out as fast as possible. This is because of time dilation and every hour on the Miller's planet is 7 years on Earth. If the crew spends too much time on Miller's planet, too much time may pass and everyone would die on Earth. After finding wreckage from Miller's ship, a tidal wave as huge as a mountain kills Doyle and delays the lander's departure. Due to the proximity of the black hole, time is [[gravitational time dilation|severely dilated]]. As a result, 23 years and 4 months have elapsed for Romilly on ''Endurance'' by the time Cooper and Brand return a few hours later.\n\nWith the ''Endurance'' having only enough fuel to reach one planet, the crew debates on whether to go to Edmunds' planet, which has slightly better [[telemetry]], or Mann's planet, which is still sending positive data. Brand wants to go to Edmunds' planet, but Cooper claims she wants to go there only because she is in love with Edmunds. Cooper chooses Mann's planet. On Mann's planet, the ''Endurance'' crew revive him from [[cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryostasis]]. Meanwhile, Murphy, now a scientist, transmits a message announcing Professor Brand has died. She has learned that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable. Plan B was always Professor Brand's only option. The reason Professor Brand lied about Plan A being viable is to give everyone hope. Murphy accuses Amelia and Cooper of knowing those left on Earth were doomed. Mann's frozen planet is uninhabitable; he had sent falsified data in order to be rescued. Mann attempts to murder Cooper, then escapes in a lander and heads for ''Endurance''.  Romilly is killed by Mann's explosive booby trap and Amelia and Cooper race to the ''Endurance'' in another lander. Mann dies during a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging ''Endurance''. The explosion causes the ''Endurance'' to spin and slowly descend into Mann's planet, but Cooper regains control after a difficult docking Maneuver. However, the ''Endurance'' has drifted too close to Gargantua and has been caught in its' gravitational pull.\n\n[[File:Black hole Interstellar.png|thumb|227px|right|Miller's planet orbiting ''Gargantua'']]\n\nWith insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, Cooper and Amelia plan to use a [[Gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] by using Gargantua's gravity to propel them towards Edmund's planet. However, being so close to Gargantua's gravity, time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper tricks Amelia by ejecting himself and TARS  to shed weight to ensure the ''Endurance'' reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the [[event horizon]] of ''Gargantua'', Cooper and TARS eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive [[tesseract]], possibly constructed by future humans. Across different time periods, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Cooper realizes he was Murphy's \"ghost\" and manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, using [[Morse code]] to transmit the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon. Cooper and TARS are ejected from the tesseract. Cooper awakens on a [[space habitat]] orbiting Saturn, where he reunites with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy solved the gravitational propulsion theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's exodus and survival. Nearing death and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return to Amelia. Cooper, who is now 124 years old, along with TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Amelia and CASE, who have begun to colonize Edmunds' planet. In the ending scene, Amelia can be seen crouching over a burial grave made with the identification plaque from Edmunds' cryo-capsule. She removes her [[space suit]]'s helmet, breathing the air of humanity's eventual new planet.\n\n==Cast==\n\n<!-- See the talk page before making changes to the listed cast. -->\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Joseph Cooper (referred only to as \"Cooper\" or \"Coop\" in the film), a widowed [[NASA]] pilot who, as the agency was closed by the [[Federal government of the United States |government of the US]], has retired to become a farmer.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Amelia Brand, a NASA astronaut and scientist.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Murphy Cooper, Joseph's younger daughter, who eventually becomes a Plan A scientist at NASA.\n** [[Mackenzie Foy]] as young Murphy\n** [[Ellen Burstyn]] as old Murphy\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mann, a NASA astronaut sent on an icy planet during the Lazarus program.\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Donald, Cooper's elderly father-in-law.\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Professor Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper and father of Amelia.\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Tom Cooper, Joseph's eldest son, who eventually grows up to become an egoist father.\n** [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as young Tom\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member and ''Endurance'' crew member.\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as TARS {{small|(voice and puppetry)}} and CASE {{small|(puppetry)}}\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as CASE {{small|(voice)}}\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Getty\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Romilly, another high-ranking NASA member and ''Endurance'' crewmember.\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Lois, Tom's wife.\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as School Principal\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Ms. Hanley\n* [[William Devane]] as Williams\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as Administrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Christopher Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Director, producer, writer\n* [[Jonathan Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Writer\n* [[Emma Thomas]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Lynda Obst]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Hoyte van Hoytema]]&nbsp;\u2013 Cinematographer\n* [[Nathan Crowley]]&nbsp;\u2013 Production designer\n* [[Mary Zophres]]&nbsp;\u2013 Costume designer\n* [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 Editor\n* [[Hans Zimmer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Music composer\n* [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Visual effects supervisor\n* [[Kip Thorne]]&nbsp;\u2013 Consultant, executive producer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Development and financing===\nThe premise for ''Interstellar'' was conceived by producer [[Lynda Obst]] and theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]], who collaborated on the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and had known each other since [[Carl Sagan]] set them up on a blind date.<ref name=\"jolin\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> The two conceived of a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,\" and attracted filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]]'s interest in directing.<ref name=\"Fernandez-Mar2007\" /> The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne.

To minimize the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.<ref name=\"mcclintock20140326\" /> Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be [[Hand-held camera|hand held]] for shooting interior scenes.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nosecone of a [[Learjet]].<ref name=\"Learjet\" />\n\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for ''Interstellar''. Writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... ''Interstellar'', just as he did with the blockbuster ''Dark Knight'' trilogy.\"<ref name=\"WSJ-Oct2013\" /> As one security measure, ''Interstellar'' was filmed under the name ''Flora's Letter'',<ref name=\"volmers\" /> Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n[[File:Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull.JPG|thumbnail|right|The Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull glacier in [[Iceland]] was used as a filming location for ''Interstellar'', doubling for Mann's planet.]]\n\nThe film's [[principal photography]] was scheduled to last four months.<ref name=\"jagernauth\" /> It began on {{nowrap|August 6}}, 2013, in the province of [[Alberta]], Canada.<ref name=\"galloway20130814\" /> Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included [[Nanton, Alberta|Nanton]], [[Longview, Alberta|Longview]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Fort Macleod]], and [[Okotoks]].

The Ranger's function is similar to the [[Space Shuttle]]'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The ''Endurance'', the crew's [[mother ship]], has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules&nbsp;\u2014 four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the ''Endurance'' was based on the [[International Space Station]]: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need back-up systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with colonization equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"<ref name=\"jolin\" />\n\nThe film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and chose a {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} [[quadrilateral]] design. The director said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines&nbsp;\u2014 those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Actor [[Bill Irwin]] voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor [[Josh Stewart]]'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> The human space habitats resemble [[O'Neill cylinder]]s, a theoretical space colony model proposed by physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] in 1976.<ref name=\"GQ-Oct2014\" />\n\n===Sound design and music===\n{{Main|Interstellar (soundtrack)}}\n[[Gregg Landaker]] and [[Gary Rizzo]] were the film's [[audio engineer]]s tasked with [[audio mixing]], while sound editor [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]] supervised the process.<ref name=\"Desowitz-Sep2014\" /> Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment<ref name=\"Hammond-Mar2014\" /> and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.<ref name=\"jensen\" /> The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the [[subwoofer]] channel.\"<ref name=\"InterstellarMovie\" /> Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.<ref name=\"McClintock-Nov2014\" />\n\nComposer [[Hans Zimmer]], who scored Nolan's Batman film trilogy and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), returned to score ''Interstellar''. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film's music, but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the ''Interstellar'' soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that a 1926 four-manual [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ would be the primary instrument for the score.<ref name=\"Lubin-Nov2014\" /><ref name=\"Kilkenny\" /> Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for ''Interstellar'', three times more than for ''Inception''. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.<ref name=\"jensen\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], which worked on ''Inception'', was brought back for ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"Giardina-Jun2014\" /> According to visual effects supervisor [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]], the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012) or ''Inception''. However, for ''Interstellar'' they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of [[Chroma key|green screens]].<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 \u00d7 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.<ref name=\"VFXshots\" />\n\nThe Ranger, ''Endurance'', and Lander spacecraft were created using [[miniature effect]]s by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. [[3D printing|3D printed]] and hand sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th scale miniature of the ''Endurance'' module spanned over {{convert|7.6|m|abbr=on}}, while a [[pyrotechnic]] model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}, respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis [[gimbal]] on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using [[VistaVision]] cameras on a smaller motion control rig.<ref name=\"EmanuelLevy-Oct2014\" /> New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.<ref name=\"VFXshots\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe director was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982),<ref name=\"EW-Apr2013\" /> ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"Empire-Oct2014\" /> [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,<ref name=\"Mueller-Oct2014\" /> who also compared ''Interstellar'' to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948) as a film about human nature.<ref name=\"Jensen-Oct2014\" /> He sought to emulate films like [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983) for the crew before production,<ref name=\"jolin\" /> following in its example by capturing reflections on the ''Interstellar'' astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut [[Marsha Ivins]] to the set.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker [[Toni Myers]] for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.<ref name=\"Space-Nov2014\" /> [[Clark Kent]]'s upbringing in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.<ref name=\"marlow\"/> Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n==Scientific accuracy==\n[[File:Kip S. Thorne EM1B8790 (24027017497).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kip Thorne]], a theoretical physicist, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.]]\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole\u2014so what you see is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] [[Einstein field equations|equations]].\"<ref name=\"ThorneWormhole\" /> Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" /> At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.<ref name=\"NPR-Nov2014\" /> According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" />\n\nAstrobiologist [[David Grinspoon]] criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.<ref name=\"MotherJones-Nov2014\" /> [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], explored the science behind the ending of ''Interstellar'', concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it.\"<ref name=\"Gray\" /> Theoretical physicist [[Michio Kaku]] praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said ''Interstellar'' \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come.\" Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former NASA [[software engineer]], said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent.\"<ref name=\"Mashable\" />\n\n===Wormholes and black holes===\nTo create the wormhole and a [[rotating black hole|rotating]], [[supermassive black hole]] (possessing an [[ergosphere]], as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced [[Theoretical Physics|theoretical equations]] to the engineers, who then wrote new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the [[gravitational lensing]] caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 [[terabyte]]s of data.<ref name=\"wired\" /> The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and [[accretion disk]]s surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three [[scientific papers]].<ref name=\"IOP-Feb2015\" /><ref name=\"AJP-Jun2015\" /><ref name=\"ACM-Jul2015\" />\n\nChristopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the [[Doppler effect]] which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.<ref name=\"NewScientist-Feb2015\" /> Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.\n\nAccording to [[Space.com]], the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.<ref name=\"Wall-Nov2014\" /> Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature\u2014about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough [[gamma radiation]] and [[X-ray]]s to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.<ref name=\"InsideScience-Nov2015\" /> ''Futura-Sciences'' praised the correct depiction of the [[Penrose process]].<ref name=\"FX-Jan2016\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nThe teaser trailer for ''Interstellar'' debuted {{nowrap|December 13}}, 2013, and featured clips related to [[space exploration]], accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character Coop.<ref name=\"McIntyre-Dec2013\" /> The theatrical trailer debuted {{nowrap|May 5}}, 2014, at the [[Lockheed Martin]] IMAX Theater in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was made available online later that month.
