The phenomenon sometimes appeared on ships at sea during thunderstorms and was regarded by sailors with religious awe for its glowing ball of light, accounting for the name.<ref>Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.</ref>  Sailors may have considered St. Elmo's fire as a good omen (as a sign of the presence of their patron saint).<ref name=\"Over the Edge of the World\">Bergreen, Laurence.

St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns.<ref name=\"island\">Heidorn, K., Ph.D. ''[http://www.islandnet.com/-see/weather/elements/stelmo.htm Weather Elements: The Fire of St. Elmo]''. Retrieved on July 2, 2007.</ref> Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound.  It is sometimes confused with [[ball lightning]].\n\n==Cause==\nSt. Elmo's fire is a form of plasma. The [[electric field]] around the object in question causes [[ionization]] of the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo's fire are present during thunderstorms, when high voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local [[electric field]] of approximately 100 kV/m is required to induce a discharge in air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high [[curvature]], so discharges preferentially occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects.\n\nThe [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere cause St. Elmo's fire to [[fluoresce]] with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes [[neon sign|neon lights]] to glow.<ref>{{cite web |title= What causes the strange glow known as St. Elmo's Fire?

It reportedly was seen emitting from the top of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] attributed it to a sign that the Christian God would soon come and destroy the conquering Muslim army. According to [[George Sphrantzes]], it disappeared just days before Constantinople fell, ending the Byzantine Empire.\n*Accounts of Magellan's first circumnavigation of the globe refer to St. Elmo's fire being seen around the fleet's ships multiple times off the coast of South America. The sailors saw these as favorable omens.\n*On 26 August 1883, the British warship ''Charles Ball'' sailing the [[Sunda Strait]] en route to Hong Kong came within 20&nbsp;km of the exploding [[Krakatoa|Krakatau volcano]] and witnessed a great deal of static electricity in the atmosphere, generated by the movement of tiny particles of rocks and droplets of water from the volcano's steam, which caused spectacular brush discharges taking place from the masts and rigging of the ship.\n*St Elmo's fire was also seen during the [[1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak]] in Kansas and Oklahoma (US).<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-19550525-stormelectricity Storm Electricity Aspects of the Blackwell/Udall Storm of May 25, 1955 \u2013 Don Burgess, University of Oklahoma (CIMMS)]</ref>\n*Among the phenomena experienced on [[British Airways Flight 9]] on 24 June 1982 were glowing light flashes along the leading edges of the aircraft, which were seen by both passengers and crew.

I was soon deprived of these luminaries by a shower of moist snow which immediately began to fall. The horse's ears soon became wet and lost their luminous appearance; but the edges of my hat, being longer of getting wet, continued to give the luminous appearance somewhat longer.\n\nI could observe an immense number of minute sparks darting towards the horse's ears and the margin of my hat, which produced a very beautiful appearance, and I was sorry to be so soon deprived of it.\n\nThe atmosphere in this neighbourhood appeared to be very highly electrified for eight or ten days about this time. Thunder was heard occasionally from 15th to 23d, during which time the weather was very unsteady: frequent showers of hail, snow, rain, &c.\n\nI can find no person in this quarter who remembers to have ever seen the luminous appearance mentioned above, before this season,\u2014or such a quantity of lightning darting across the heavens,\u2014nor who have heard so much thunder at that season of the year.\n\nThis country being all stocked with sheep, and the herds having frequent occasion to pay attention to the state of the weather, it is not to be thought that such an appearance can have been at all frequent, and none of them to have observed it.<ref group=note>Braid also writes that one of his friends had a similar experience on the evening of the preceding Saturday: in which, his friend reported, he had seen \"his horse's ears being the same as two burning candles, and the edges of his hat being all in a flame\" (p.471).</ref>|James Braid, 1817<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Braid, J. |title=Account of a Thunder Storm in the Neighbourhood of Leadhills, Lanarkshire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsQCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA471 |magazine=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine |volume=1 |issue=5 |date=August 1817 |pages=471\u2013472}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWeeks earlier, reportedly on 17 January 1817, a luminous snowstorm occurred in Vermont and New Hampshire.

Standing outside the main gate to the Naval Air Station, he watched, together with his wife and son, as the airship approached the mast and dropped her bow lines. A minute thereafter, by Heald's estimation, he first noticed a dim \"blue flame\" flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, \"Oh, heavens, the thing is afire,\" for her to reply, \"Where?\" and for him to answer, \"Up along the top ridge\" \u2013 before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship's length from the stern.<ref>Robinson, Douglas.

It was, I surmised, a surcharge of static electricity that had accumulated on the tips of the propellers and on the dielectric material in the plastic windows. One's thoughts dwelt anxiously on the precious cargo in the invisible ship ahead of us.

However, one of the earliest direct references to St. Elmo's fire made in fiction can be found in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s epic poem ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516). It is located in the 17th canto (19th in the revised edition of 1532) after a storm has punished the ship of Marfisa, Astolfo, Aquilant, Grifon, and others, for three straight days, and is positively associated with hope:\n{{Quote|\nBut now St. Elmo's fire appeared, which they had so longed for, it settled at the bows of a fore stay, the masts and yards all being gone, and gave them hope of calmer airs.|Ludovico Ariosto, 1516\n}}\n\nIn [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' (c. 1623), Act I, Scene II, St. Elmo's fire acquires a more negative association, appearing as evidence of the tempest inflicted by Ariel according to the command of Prospero:\n\n{{Quote|\n PROSPERO\n:Hast thou, spirit,\n:Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\n ARIEL\n:To every article.\n:I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\n:Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\n:I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,\n:And burn in many places; on the topmast,\n:The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\n:Then meet and join.\n| Act I, Scene II\n| ''[[The Tempest]]''\n}}\n\nThe fires are also mentioned as \"death fires\" in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'':\n\n{{Quote|\n:About, about, in reel and rout,\n:The death fires danced at night;\n:The water, like a witch's oils,\n:Burnt green and blue and white.\n}}\n\nLater in 18th century and 19th century, literature associated St. Elmo's fire with bad omen or [[divine judgment]], coinciding with the growing conventions of [[Romanticism]] and the [[Gothic novel]]. For example, in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), during a thunderstorm above the ramparts of the castle:\n\n{{Quote|\n\"And what is that tapering of light you bear?\" said Emily, \"see how it darts upwards,\u2014and now it vanishes!\"\n\n\"This light, lady\", said the soldier, \"has appeared to-night as you see it, on the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell\".\n\n\"This is very strange!\" said Emily.\n\n\"My fellow-guard\", continued the man, \"has the same flame on his arms; he says he has sometimes seen it before...he says it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good\".\n\n\"And what harm can it bode?\" rejoined Emily.\n\n\"He knows not so much as that, lady\".\n| Vol. III, Ch. IV\n| ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]''\n}}\n\n\nIn the 1864 novel [[Journey to the Center of the Earth]] by [[Jules Verne]], the author describes the fire occurring while sailing during a subterranean electrical storm (Chapter 35, Page 191):\n\n{{Quote|On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.\n}}\n\nIn [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', Starbuck points out \"corpusants\" during a thunder storm in the Japanese sea in chapter 119 \"The Candles\".\n\nSt. Elmo's fire makes an appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic, ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', by [[Herg\u00e9]]. [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] recognizes the phenomenon on [[Captain Haddock]]'s [[ice-axe]].\n\nIn [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', [[Billy Pilgrim]] sees the phenomenon on soldiers' helmets and on rooftops. Vonnegut's ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' also notes the phenomenon affecting Winston Niles Rumfoord's dog, Kazak, the Hound of Space, in conjunction with solar disturbances of the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.\n\nIn \"On The Banks of Plum Creek\" by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] St. Elmo's fire is seen by the girls and Ma during one of the blizzards. It was described as coming down the stove pipe and rolling across the floor following Ma's knitting needles; it didn't burn the floor (pages 309-310).  The phenomenon as described, however, is more similar to [[ball lightning]].\n\nIn \"Voyager,\" the third major novel in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s popular [[Outlander series|Outlander]] series, the primary characters experience St. Elmo's fire while lost at sea in a thunderstorm between [[Hispaniola]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\n==In television==\nOn the children's television series ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), Episode 4 shows St. Elmo's Fire affecting the ship as it sailed past the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The real-life footage at the end of the episode has snippets of an interview with Japanese sailor Fukunari Imada, whose comments were translated to \"Although I've never seen St. Elmo's Fire, I'd certainly like to. It was often considered a bad omen as it played havoc with compasses and equipment\". The TV series also referred to St. Elmo's Fire as being a bad omen during the cartoon. The footage was captured as part of his winning solo yacht race in 1981.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1981/198107/19810723/19810723006_6.html Japanese wins solo yacht race across Pacific.]</ref>\n\nOn the American television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in a 1959 episode titled \"Incident of the Blue Fire\", [[Droving|cattle drovers]] on a stormy night see St. Elmo's Fire glowing on the horns of their steers, which the men regard as a deadly omen.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/rawhide/incident-of-the-blue-fire-135393/ \"Incident of the Blue Fire\"], ''Rawhide'' (S02E11), originally aired December 11, 1959.

As he takes the rifle from her he proclaims, ''\"Something out there, you could live five lifetimes, and never see again,\"'' the audience is then shown a shot of the cattle with a blue or violet glow coming from their horns. ''\"Look. St. Elmo's Fire. Never seen it except on ships,\"'' O'Malley says as Belle says, ''\"I've never seen it anywhere. What is it?\"''  Trying to win her back he says, ''\"Well a star fell and smashed and scattered its glow all over the place.\"''\n\n''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985) is clearly named after this phenomenon. [[Rob Lowe]]'s character mistakenly claims it's not even a real thing.\n\nIn the western miniseries [[Lonesome Dove (miniseries)]] (1989-1990) lightning strikes a herd of cows during a storm, causing their horns to glow blue.\n\nIn [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', the phenomenon is clearly observed in the opening sequence and later in the film as the [[rogue planet]] Melancholia approaches Earth for an [[impact event]].\n\nIt is also mentioned in Robert Eggers' 2019 horror film, ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' in reference to the mysterious salvation that the Lighthouse Keeper Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]])) is hiding from Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) up inside the Fresnel lens of the lantern.\n\n==In music==\n[[Brian Eno]]'s third studio album ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) contains a song titled \"St. Elmo's Fire\" in which guesting [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] (credited with playing \"Wimshurst guitar\" in the liner notes) improvises a lightning-fast solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a [[Wimshurst machine|Wimshurst high voltage generator]].\n\nMichael Frank's song \"St Elmo's Fire\" was released on his album \"The Art of Tea\" in 1976.

The phenomenon sometimes appeared on ships at sea during thunderstorms and was regarded by sailors with religious awe for its glowing ball of light, accounting for the name.<ref>Eyers, Jonathan (2011).

St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns.<ref name=\"island\">Heidorn, K., Ph.D. ''[http://www.islandnet.com/-see/weather/elements/stelmo.htm Weather Elements: The Fire of St. Elmo]''. Retrieved on July 2, 2007.</ref> Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound.  It is sometimes confused with [[ball lightning]].\n\n==Cause==\nSt. Elmo's fire is a form of plasma. The [[electric field]] around the object in question causes [[ionization]] of the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo's fire are present during thunderstorms, when high voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local [[electric field]] of approximately 100 kV/m is required to induce a discharge in air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high [[curvature]], so discharges preferentially occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects.\n\nThe [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere cause St. Elmo's fire to [[fluoresce]] with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes [[neon sign|neon lights]] to glow.<ref>{{cite web |title= What causes the strange glow known as St. Elmo's Fire?

I was soon deprived of these luminaries by a shower of moist snow which immediately began to fall. The horse's ears soon became wet and lost their luminous appearance; but the edges of my hat, being longer of getting wet, continued to give the luminous appearance somewhat longer.\n\nI could observe an immense number of minute sparks darting towards the horse's ears and the margin of my hat, which produced a very beautiful appearance, and I was sorry to be so soon deprived of it.\n\nThe atmosphere in this neighbourhood appeared to be very highly electrified for eight or ten days about this time. Thunder was heard occasionally from 15th to 23d, during which time the weather was very unsteady: frequent showers of hail, snow, rain, &c.\n\nI can find no person in this quarter who remembers to have ever seen the luminous appearance mentioned above, before this season,\u2014or such a quantity of lightning darting across the heavens,\u2014nor who have heard so much thunder at that season of the year.\n\nThis country being all stocked with sheep, and the herds having frequent occasion to pay attention to the state of the weather, it is not to be thought that such an appearance can have been at all frequent, and none of them to have observed it.<ref group=note>Braid also writes that one of his friends had a similar experience on the evening of the preceding Saturday: in which, his friend reported, he had seen \"his horse's ears being the same as two burning candles, and the edges of his hat being all in a flame\" (p.471).</ref>|James Braid, 1817<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Braid, J. |title=Account of a Thunder Storm in the Neighbourhood of Leadhills, Lanarkshire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsQCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA471 |magazine=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine |volume=1 |issue=5 |date=August 1817 |pages=471\u2013472}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWeeks earlier, reportedly on 17 January 1817, a luminous snowstorm occurred in Vermont and New Hampshire.

Standing outside the main gate to the Naval Air Station, he watched, together with his wife and son, as the airship approached the mast and dropped her bow lines. A minute thereafter, by Heald's estimation, he first noticed a dim \"blue flame\" flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, \"Oh, heavens, the thing is afire,\" for her to reply, \"Where?\" and for him to answer, \"Up along the top ridge\" \u2013 before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship's length from the stern.<ref>Robinson, Douglas.

It was, I surmised, a surcharge of static electricity that had accumulated on the tips of the propellers and on the dielectric material in the plastic windows. One's thoughts dwelt anxiously on the precious cargo in the invisible ship ahead of us.

However, one of the earliest direct references to St. Elmo's fire made in fiction can be found in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s epic poem ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516). It is located in the 17th canto (19th in the revised edition of 1532) after a storm has punished the ship of Marfisa, Astolfo, Aquilant, Grifon, and others, for three straight days, and is positively associated with hope:\n{{Quote|\nBut now St. Elmo's fire appeared, which they had so longed for, it settled at the bows of a fore stay, the masts and yards all being gone, and gave them hope of calmer airs.|Ludovico Ariosto, 1516\n}}\n\nIn [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' (c. 1623), Act I, Scene II, St. Elmo's fire acquires a more negative association, appearing as evidence of the tempest inflicted by Ariel according to the command of Prospero:\n\n{{Quote|\n PROSPERO\n:Hast thou, spirit,\n:Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\n ARIEL\n:To every article.\n:I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\n:Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\n:I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,\n:And burn in many places; on the topmast,\n:The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\n:Then meet and join.\n| Act I, Scene II\n| ''[[The Tempest]]''\n}}\n\nThe fires are also mentioned as \"death fires\" in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'':\n\n{{Quote|\nAbout, about, in reel and rout,\nThe death fires danced at night;\nThe water, like a witch's oils,\nBurnt green and blue and white.\n}}\n\nLater in 18th century and 19th century, literature associated St. Elmo's fire with bad omen or [[divine judgment]], coinciding with the growing conventions of [[Romanticism]] and the [[Gothic novel]]. For example, in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), during a thunderstorm above the ramparts of the castle:\n\n{{Quote|\n\"And what is that tapering of light you bear?\" said Emily, \"see how it darts upwards,\u2014and now it vanishes!\"\n\n\"This light, lady\", said the soldier, \"has appeared to-night as you see it, on the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell\".\n\n\"This is very strange!\" said Emily.\n\n\"My fellow-guard\", continued the man, \"has the same flame on his arms; he says he has sometimes seen it before...he says it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good\".\n\n\"And what harm can it bode?\" rejoined Emily.\n\n\"He knows not so much as that, lady\".\n| Vol. III, Ch. IV\n| ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]''\n}}\n\n\nIn the 1864 novel [[Journey to the Center of the Earth]] by [[Jules Verne]], the author describes the fire occurring while sailing during a subterranean electrical storm (Chapter 35, Page 191):\n\n{{Quote|On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.\n}}\n\nIn [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', Starbuck points out \"corpusants\" during a thunder storm in the Japanese sea in chapter 119 \"The Candles\".\n\nSt. Elmo's fire makes an appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic, ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', by [[Herg\u00e9]]. [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] recognizes the phenomenon on [[Captain Haddock]]'s [[ice-axe]].\n\nIn [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', [[Billy Pilgrim]] sees the phenomenon on soldiers' helmets and on rooftops. Vonnegut's ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' also notes the phenomenon affecting Winston Niles Rumfoord's dog, Kazak, the Hound of Space, in conjunction with solar disturbances of the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.\n\nIn \"On The Banks of Plum Creek\" by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] St. Elmo's fire is seen by the girls and Ma during one of the blizzards. It was described as coming down the stove pipe and rolling across the floor following Ma's knitting needles; it didn't burn the floor (pages 309-310).  The phenomenon as described, however, is more similar to [[ball lightning]].\n\nIn \"Voyager,\" the third major novel in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s popular [[Outlander series|Outlander]] series, the primary characters experience St. Elmo's fire while lost at sea in a thunderstorm between [[Hispaniola]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\n==In television==\nOn the children's television series ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), Episode 4 shows St. Elmo's Fire affecting the ship as it sailed past the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The real-life footage at the end of the episode has snippets of an interview with Japanese sailor Fukunari Imada, whose comments were translated to \"Although I've never seen St. Elmo's Fire, I'd certainly like to. It was often considered a bad omen as it played havoc with compasses and equipment\". The TV series also referred to St. Elmo's Fire as being a bad omen during the cartoon. The footage was captured as part of his winning solo yacht race in 1981.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1981/198107/19810723/19810723006_6.html Japanese wins solo yacht race across Pacific.]</ref>\n\nOn the American television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in a 1959 episode titled \"Incident of the Blue Fire\", [[Droving|cattle drovers]] on a stormy night see St. Elmo's Fire glowing on the horns of their steers, which the men regard as a deadly omen.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/rawhide/incident-of-the-blue-fire-135393/ \"Incident of the Blue Fire\"], ''Rawhide'' (S02E11), originally aired December 11, 1959.

[[Rob Lowe]]'s character mistakenly claims it's not even a real thing.\n\nIn the western miniseries [[Lonesome Dove (miniseries)]] (1989-1990) lightning strikes a herd of cows during a storm, causing their horns to glow blue.\n\nIn [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', the phenomenon is clearly observed in the opening sequence and later in the film as the [[rogue planet]] Melancholia approaches Earth for an [[impact event]].\n\nIt is also mentioned in Robert Eggers' 2019 horror film, ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' in reference to the mysterious salvation that the Lighthouse Keeper Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]])) is hiding from Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) up inside the Fresnel lens of the lantern.\n\n==In music==\n[[Brian Eno]]'s third studio album ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) contains a song titled \"St. Elmo's Fire\" in which guesting [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] (credited with playing \"Wimshurst guitar\" in the liner notes) improvises a lightning-fast solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a [[Wimshurst machine|Wimshurst high voltage generator]].\n\nMichael Frank's song \"St Elmo's Fire\" was released on his album \"The Art of Tea\" in 1976. His song has since been sampled various times by artists like Absolutely Fabolous, & more.\n\nThe first song in [[Susumu Hirasawa]]'s album [[Aurora (Susumu Hirasawa album)|Aurora]], \"Stone Garden\" (\u77f3\u306e\u5ead ''Ishi no Niwa''), contains a line which translates to <blockquote><poem>That day when I melted away into the sky\nBurning like St. Elmo's sacred fire<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phonon-belt.livejournal.com/16958.html|title=\u5e73\u6ca2\u9032 -\u300c\u77f3\u306e\u5ead |trans-title=Hirasawa Susumu - \"Stone Garden\" Lyrics |author=phonon_belt |date=October 25, 2011 |language=ja |website=phonon-belt.livejournal.com/ |access-date=}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n\"[[St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)]]\" is a song recorded by [[John Parr]]. It hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on September 7, 1985, remaining there for two weeks. It was the main theme for Joel Schumacher's 1985 film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ball lightning]]\n*[[British Airways Flight 9]]\n*[[Earthquake light]]\n*[[Foo fighter]], WWII UFO observations\n*[[Hessdalen lights]]\n*[[List of plasma physics articles]]\n*[[Naga fireball]], rising from Mekong river\n*[[Sprite (lightning)]]\n*[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|''St. Elmo's Fire'' (film)]]\n*[[Triboelectric effect]]\n*[[Will-o'-the-wisp]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|St. Elmo's Fire}}\n*[http://www.airliners.net/photo/Jetstar-Airways/Airbus-A320-232/1553634/L/ St. Elmo's fire photographed on the flight deck of an airliner]\n*{{YouTube|T5cqazajP1Q|St. Elmo's Fire on Lake Monona}}\n\n{{Atmospheric electricity}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:St. Elmo's Fire}}\n[[Category:Atmospheric ghost lights]]\n[[Category:Electrical phenomena]]\n[[Category:Light sources]]\n", "name_user": "Grammarian79", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn literature", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire"}

It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>  Virtually all money is made by selling Jones' dietary supplements to viewers and listeners.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>\n\nThe diet supplement products sold on ''InfoWars'' are \"largely produced by Dr. Edward F.

As a private firm, ''InfoWars'' and its affiliated companies (\"a web of limited-liability companies\") are not required to make public financial statements, with the result observers can only estimate its revenue and profits.<ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/>\n\nPrior to 2013, Jones focused on building a \"media empire\".<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Seth |title=Alex Jones\u2019s Media Empire Is a Machine Built to Sell Snake-Oil Diet Supplements |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/how-does-alex-jones-make-money.html |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 4, 2017}}</ref> By 2013,  Alex Seitz-Wald of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' estimated that Jones was earning as much as [[USD|US$]]10 million a year between subscriptions, web and radio advertising, and sales of DVDs, T-shirts, and other merchandise.<ref name=\"salon\">{{cite web |last1=Sietz-Wald |first1=Alex |title=Alex Jones: Conspiracy Inc. |url=https://www.salon.com/2013/05/02/alex_jones_conspiracy_inc/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=9 September 2018 |date=May 2, 2013}}</ref> That year, Jones changed his business model to incorporate selling proprietary dietary supplements, including one that promised to \"supercharge\" cognitive functions.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>\n\nUnlike most talk radio shows, ''InfoWars'' itself does not directly generate income. It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>  Virtually all money is made by selling Jones' dietary supplements to viewers and listeners.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>\n\nThe diet supplement products sold on ''InfoWars'' are \"largely produced by Dr. Edward F.

Mr. Jones bought four Rolex watches in one day in 2014, and spent $40,000 on a saltwater aquarium.

Super League Greece] \n}}\n\n==Play-offs==\nIn the play-off for Champions League, the teams play each other in a home and away [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]]. However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five to give the other teams the points with which they start the mini-league.\n\nThe teams started the play-offs with the following number of points:\n* Olympiacos \u2013 4 points ''((64\u201346) / 5 = 3.6, rounded up to 4)''\n* P.A.O.K. \u2013 3 points ''((62\u201346) / 5 = 3.2, rounded to 3)''\n* AEK Athens \u2013 1 point ''((53\u201346) / 5 = 1.4, rounded to

However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five to give the other teams the points with which they start the mini-league.\n\nThe teams started the play-offs with the following number of points:\n* Olympiacos \u2013 4 points ''((64\u201346) / 5 = 3.6, rounded up to 4)''\n* P.A.O.K. \u2013 3 points ''((62\u201346) / 5 = 3.2, rounded to 3)''\n* AEK Athens \u2013 1 point ''((53\u201346) / 5 = 1.4, rounded to 1)''\n* Aris \u2013 0 points ''((46\u201346) / 5 = 0)''\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|section = Play-offs\n|show_limit = 5\n|res_col_header=Q\n\n|highest_pos=2\n\n|team2=PAOK|team3=AEK|team4=ARI|team5=OLY\n\n<!--\nadjust_points parameter denotes starting points for the first three teams\n-->\n\n|win_PAOK=4|draw_PAOK=1|loss_PAOK=1|gf_PAOK=7|ga_PAOK=3|adjust_points_PAOK=3\n|win_AEK=2|draw_AEK=2|loss_AEK=2|gf_AEK=8|ga_AEK=7|adjust_points_AEK=1\n|win_ARI=2|draw_ARI=2|loss_ARI=2|gf_ARI=8|ga_ARI=9\n|win_OLY=1|draw_OLY=1|loss_OLY=4|gf_OLY=3|ga_OLY=7|adjust_points_OLY=4\n|hth_ARI=Head-to-head record: Aris\u2013Olympiacos 2\u20130, Olympiacos\u2013Aris 0\u20130.\n|hth_OLY=ARI\n|col_CL3=green2|text_CL3=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]]\n|result2=CL3\n|col_ELPR=blue1|text_ELPR=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League#Play-off round|Europa League play-off round]]\n|note_res_ELPR=EL3\n|result3=ELPR\n|col_EL3=blue2|text_EL3=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League#Third qualifying round|Europa League third qualifying round]]\n|note_res_EL3=Since Aris lost the [[2009\u201310 Greek Cup]] Final against Champions League-qualified [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], all Europa League spots will be determined by the play-off group positions.\n|result4=EL3\n|col_EL2=blue3|text_EL2=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|Europa League second qualifying round]]\n|note_res_EL2=EL3\n|result5=EL2\n\n|class_rules=1) points;

The Songwriters' Guild of Great Britain, later known as The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors was founded in 1947 by Ivor Novello, Sir Alan Herbert, Eric Coates, Haydn Wood, Richard Addinsell and others for the encouragement and protection of British popular music,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/SPYmaschwitz.htm|title=Eric Maschwitz|website=Spartacus-educational.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}</ref> with Eric Maschwitz acting as the first Vice Chair, and Chairman in 1948, and again between 1954 and 1958. The Association of Professional Composers was founded in 1976 by [[George Fenton]] to represent composers of film and TV music. In 1958 the Composers' Guild of Great Britain began publishing the journal ''Composer'', and also published a number of catalogs of available works. In 1967 the organisation, under the direction of [[Ruth Gipps]], established the [[British Music Information Centre]].\n\nIn 1999 The Association of Professional Composers (APC) and the Composers' Guild of Great Britain (CGGB) merged with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors to provide a single, more powerful amalgamated organisation to represent its membership. The organization's current name was adopted in March 2009. Sir [[Tim Rice]] was elected first president, and [[Guy Fletcher (songwriter)|Guy Fletcher]] and [[David Stoll (composer)|David Stoll]] served as joint chairs of a nine-member Board of Directors. Three executive committees were established to administer Pop and Theatrical Music, Concert Music and Media. BASCA now has four genre committees representing Songwriters, Classical, Jazz and Media composers.\n\nMembers of The Ivors Academy include emerging songwriters and the United Kingdom's \"most experienced and successful writers.\" A partial list of the past and present members includes [[David Arnold]] (fellow), [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] (fellow), [[George Fenton]], [[Guy Garvey]], [[Howard Goodall]], [[Annie Lennox]] (fellow), [[Elton John]] (fellow), and [[Paul McCartney]] (fellow).
