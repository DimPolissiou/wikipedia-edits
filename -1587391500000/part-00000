Praveen is a man who shows a lot of respect to his god Guruji and attacks anyone who insults his beloved god. However, both their bosses (both played by [[Kumud Mishra]]) encourage them to go to Poland for a mission and hosting the world's best bombers so the 2 terrorists go. Both Praveen and Hafeez meet at the airport and decide to change their names to Allah Rakha Khan and Ishwarchand Sharma but both get arrested. Although still arrested, they go to Poland to become bomb experts. The two go to two different local bomb experts. Allah Rakha goes to a Chinese restaurant owner, where he learns that the restaurant owner speaks Hindi and gives him specific bombs. Ishwarchand goes to a potato farmer, Mr. Babinski, who is actually a master spy and saboteur and offers him a lot of bombs but Ishwarchand asks for a cheaper bomb. The 2 of them later fall in love with Rosie ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]) then a love triangle between the 3 begins to spark up. After Rosie's parents' anniversary, they ask her about her religion to which she replies that she doesn't follow any religion as all religions propagate the same thing. Hafeez and Praveen become best friends and while drinking liquor both reveal their original identities. They get embroiled in a fight in which a bomb explodes which Praveen was making. They get injured and are admitted in a hospital with their labels as 'Terrorists'. The North Bangistanis plan and train another suicide bomber, Zulfi ([[Arya Babbar]]) to create terror since Hafeez's name is out. Hafeez realises that his boss wants to just spread terror in the name of religion and explains Praveen the same but Praveen  acts in front of Hafeez that he is on his side but actually he wants to go ahead with the explosion. When both reach the conference, he finds Praveen activating the bomb in a washroom and then they get in a fight in which Praveen realises his mistake. At last they both expose the nature of their bosses and people misguided in the name of religion. But the bomb which was placed by Zulfi explodes leaving Hafeez and Praveen injured but this time, they are regarded as heroes.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as Hafeez Bin Ali/Ishwarchand Sharma\n*[[Pulkit Samrat]] as Praveen Chaturvedi/Allah Rakha Khan\n*[[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Rosie \n*[[Kumud Mishra]] as Guru/Abba\n*[[Chandan Roy Sanyal]] as Tamim Iqbal\n*[[Arya Babbar]] as Zulfi\n*[[Tomasz Karolak]] as Peter Jackson\n*[[Tom Alter]] as the Imam\n*Zachary Coffin as Stanislav the Polish Cop<ref name=\"YouTube - Bangistan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgY8ln0HxxM|title='Bangistan' movie - Comic Police Scene with Ritesh Deshmukh, Megh Pant & Zachary Coffin|publisher=YouTube.com|accessdate=2017-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack of the album is composed by [[Ram Sampath]], and lyrics written by \nPuneet Krishna.

The 12Y became the primary French 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] and [[Dewoitine D.520]].\n\nIts design was based on the earlier and somewhat smaller, [[Hispano-Suiza 12X|12X]]. The 12X did not see widespread use before the 12Y replaced it and became one of the most powerful French designs on the eve of the war. The [[Hispano-Suiza 12Z|12Z]] was being designed but this was ended by the fall of France and the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]].\n\nThe 12Y was produced under [[Hispano-Suiza]] licence in the Soviet Union as the '''Klimov M-100'''. This design led to the highly successful [[Klimov M-105|Klimov VK-105]] series that powered the [[Yak-1|Yakovlev]] and [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3|Lavochkin]] fighters as well as the [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] bomber. Licensed production of the early models was also undertaken in [[Czechoslovakia]] as the '''Avia HS 12Ydrs''' and in [[Switzerland]] as the HS-77.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Early development===\nThe 12Y was a fairly traditional in construction, a 36-litre [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] with the two cast aluminium cylinder banks set at 60 degrees to each other. The [[cylinder head]]s were not removable, instead both [[cylinder bank]]s could be quickly removed from the [[crankcase]] section of the engine. This made it somewhat famous for being leak-proof, a design feature that was considered by other designers and almost became a part of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]].\n\nThe major design change from the earlier 12X was to use a master-articulated [[connecting rod]] system, instead of the fork-and-blade type. A [[single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC) drove the [[Poppet valve|valves]], which were filled with liquid [[sodium]] for cooling. Only a single intake and exhaust valve were used, unlike most designs of the era which had moved to three or four valves per cylinder. A single-stage, single-speed [[supercharger]] was standard, although the art of designing a useful [[intake]] was not as well developed as in other countries, and high [[altitude]] performance was always lacking.\n\nThe first 12Y test articles were constructed in 1932, and almost immediately the entire French aviation industry started designing around it. At the time the engine developed only 760&nbsp;hp (570&nbsp;kW), but it was clear it had potential to the 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class. An early modification led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs''' which used a hollow [[Driveshaft|propeller shaft]] to allow a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]] to fire through the propeller spinner (a combination known as a ''moteur-canon''). All later versions shared this feature. The '''12Ydrs''' was the next major series, with a basic rating of 836&nbsp;hp (623&nbsp;kW) at sea level with a [[compression ratio]] of 5.8:1.\n\nThe [[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] changed their nomenclature, so the next version was the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-21''', which increased the compression ratio to 7:1, when running on 100 [[octane]] [[Avgas|gasoline]]. This boosted power to 867&nbsp;hp (647 &nbsp;kW). In 1936 the connecting rod design was changed slightly to create the '''12Y-31''', but the lower 5.8:1 compression ratio was retained and the power was increased only slightly over the drs model to 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW). Nevertheless, this became one of the most used engine designs of the pre-war era, used in almost all French fighter designs and prototypes.\n\n[[File:Moteur Hispano-Suiza 12 Ybrs DSC 0351.jpg|thumb|right|12 Ybrs showing valve gear]]\n\n===Late variants===\nA real effort to improve the performance of the engine in 1938 resulted in the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45''', which used the S-39-H3 supercharger co-designed by Andr\u00e9 Planiol and [[Poland|Polish]] engineer [[Joseph Szydlowski]]. The Szydlowski-Planiol device was larger, but much more efficient than the indifferent Hispano-Suiza models. When used with 100 octane fuel, the supercharger boosted to the -21's 7:1, increasing power to 900&nbsp;hp (670&nbsp;kW). Combined with the fully adjustable Ratier propeller, this allowed the D.520 to perform as well as contemporary designs from Germany and England.\n\nAnother improvement in supercharging led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-49''', whose performance improved from 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW) at sea level to 920&nbsp;hp (690&nbsp;kW) at just over 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,000&nbsp;m). This improvement in power with altitude was a common feature of most engines of the era, the result of the supercharger \"robbing\" power at low altitudes while not boosting the power due to the possibility of detonation.\n\nThe final major version was the 1,085&nbsp;hp (809&nbsp;kW) '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51''', which had just started into production at the time of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]]. The -51 was the first version that came close to the performance limits of the engine, although the single-stage supercharging meant that it was unable to compete with designs from England and Germany above 15,000&nbsp;ft (5,000&nbsp;m).\n\n===Foreign derivatives===\nIn the early 1930s the [[Czechoslovakia]]n Republic gained rights to build a license version of the HS-12Y. This was produced by [[Avia]] ([[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]]) at Prag - [[\u010cakovice]]. The engine was intended to become the standard powerplant of all Czech military aircraft. Both the HS-12Ycrs and HS-12Ydrs were built in quantity and were more commonly known by these names rather than any Czech designation. Aircraft powered by these engines included the [[Avia B-34]], [[Avia B-534]], [[Avia B-71]], [[Avia B-35]], [[Avia B-135]] and [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] .\n\nSwitzerland license built and assembled several different versions of the basic 12Ycrs for use in several aircraft: the reconnaissance biplane the [[EKW C-35]], the multipurpose [[EKW C-36]], the Swiss assembled [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D-3800]] copy of the French M.S. 406 fighter and Swiss built versions of the French M.S.412 fighter called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3801]]. [[Saurer]] developed the engine further after the Fall of France into the YS-2 and YS-3 engines.  These were used in more powerful follow-on versions of the same basic French fighter design, the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|M.S.450]] called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3802]] and then the final version called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3803]].\n\nIn the mid-1930s, [[Russia]]n engineer Vladimir Klimov was sent to France to obtain a license for local production of the 12Y. A series of design changes were added to cope with cold weather operation, and the engine entered production in 1935 as the [[Klimov M-100]] with about 750&nbsp;hp (560&nbsp;kW).<ref>Kotelnikov 2005, p. 136.</ref> However a series of continual upgrades increased the allowable RPM from the 12Y's fairly low 2,400 to 2,700, thereby increasing power to 1,100&nbsp;hp (820&nbsp;kW). The resulting design, the '''[[Klimov M-105]] (VK-105)''' became one of the major Soviet engine designs during the war, powering all [[Yakovlev]] fighters.\n\n==Variants==\nTabulated data from Lage 2004<ref name=Lage>Lage, 2004, p.486-7</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Type 73 Hispano 12Y engines.

The 12Y became the primary French 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] and [[Dewoitine D.520]].\n\nIts design was based on the earlier and somewhat smaller, [[Hispano-Suiza 12X|12X]]. The 12X did not see widespread use before the 12Y replaced it and became one of the most powerful French designs on the eve of the war. The [[Hispano-Suiza 12Z|12Z]] was being designed but this was ended by the fall of France and the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]].\n\nThe 12Y was produced under [[Hispano-Suiza]] licence in the Soviet Union as the '''Klimov M-100'''. This design led to the highly successful [[Klimov M-105|Klimov VK-105]] series that powered the [[Yak-1|Yakovlev]] and [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3|Lavochkin]] fighters as well as the [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] bomber. Licensed production of the early models was also undertaken in [[Czechoslovakia]] as the '''Avia HS 12Ydrs''' and in [[Switzerland]] as the HS-77.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Early development===\nThe 12Y was a fairly traditional in construction, a 36-litre [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] with the two cast aluminium cylinder banks set at 60 degrees to each other. The [[cylinder head]]s were not removable, instead both [[cylinder bank|cylinder banks]] could be quickly removed from the [[crankcase]] section of the engine. This made it somewhat famous for being leak-proof, a design feature that was considered by other designers and almost became a part of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]].\n\nThe major design change from the earlier 12X was to use a master-articulated [[connecting rod]] system, instead of the fork-and-blade type. A [[single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC) drove the [[Poppet valve|valves]], which were filled with liquid [[sodium]] for cooling. Only a single intake and exhaust valve were used, unlike most designs of the era which had moved to three or four valves per cylinder. A single-stage, single-speed [[supercharger]] was standard, although the art of designing a useful [[intake]] was not as well developed as in other countries, and high [[altitude]] performance was always lacking.\n\nThe first 12Y test articles were constructed in 1932, and almost immediately the entire French aviation industry started designing around it. At the time the engine developed only 760&nbsp;hp (570&nbsp;kW), but it was clear it had potential to the 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class. An early modification led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs''' which used a hollow [[Driveshaft|propeller shaft]] to allow a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]] to fire through the propeller spinner (a combination known as a ''moteur-canon''). All later versions shared this feature. The '''12Ydrs''' was the next major series, with a basic rating of 836&nbsp;hp (623&nbsp;kW) at sea level with a [[compression ratio]] of 5.8:1.\n\nThe [[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] changed their nomenclature, so the next version was the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-21''', which increased the compression ratio to 7:1, when running on 100 [[octane]] [[Avgas|gasoline]]. This boosted power to 867&nbsp;hp (647 &nbsp;kW). In 1936 the connecting rod design was changed slightly to create the '''12Y-31''', but the lower 5.8:1 compression ratio was retained and the power was increased only slightly over the drs model to 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW). Nevertheless, this became one of the most used engine designs of the pre-war era, used in almost all French fighter designs and prototypes.\n\n[[File:Moteur Hispano-Suiza 12 Ybrs DSC 0351.jpg|thumb|right|12 Ybrs showing valve gear]]\n\n===Late variants===\nA real effort to improve the performance of the engine in 1938 resulted in the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45''', which used the S-39-H3 supercharger co-designed by Andr\u00e9 Planiol and [[Poland|Polish]] engineer [[Joseph Szydlowski]]. The Szydlowski-Planiol device was larger, but much more efficient than the indifferent Hispano-Suiza models. When used with 100 octane fuel, the supercharger boosted to the -21's 7:1, increasing power to 900&nbsp;hp (670&nbsp;kW). Combined with the fully adjustable Ratier propeller, this allowed the D.520 to perform as well as contemporary designs from Germany and England.\n\nAnother improvement in supercharging led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-49''', whose performance improved from 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW) at sea level to 920&nbsp;hp (690&nbsp;kW) at just over 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,000&nbsp;m). This improvement in power with altitude was a common feature of most engines of the era, the result of the supercharger \"robbing\" power at low altitudes while not boosting the power due to the possibility of detonation.\n\nThe final major version was the 1,085&nbsp;hp (809&nbsp;kW) '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51''', which had just started into production at the time of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]]. The -51 was the first version that came close to the performance limits of the engine, although the single-stage supercharging meant that it was unable to compete with designs from England and Germany above 15,000&nbsp;ft (5,000&nbsp;m).\n\n===Foreign derivatives===\nIn the early 1930s the [[Czechoslovakia]]n Republic gained rights to build a license version of the HS-12Y. This was produced by [[Avia]] ([[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]]) at Prag - [[\u010cakovice]]. The engine was intended to become the standard powerplant of all Czech military aircraft. Both the HS-12Ycrs and HS-12Ydrs were built in quantity and were more commonly known by these names rather than any Czech designation. Aircraft powered by these engines included the [[Avia B-34]], [[Avia B-534]], [[Avia B-71]], [[Avia B-35]], [[Avia B-135]] and [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] .\n\nSwitzerland license built and assembled several different versions of the basic 12Ycrs for use in several aircraft: the reconnaissance biplane the [[EKW C-35]], the multipurpose [[EKW C-36]], the Swiss assembled [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D-3800]] copy of the French M.S. 406 fighter and Swiss built versions of the French M.S.412 fighter called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3801]]. [[Saurer]] developed the engine further after the Fall of France into the YS-2 and YS-3 engines.  These were used in more powerful follow-on versions of the same basic French fighter design, the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|M.S.450]] called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3802]] and then the final version called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3803]].\n\nIn the mid-1930s, [[Russia]]n engineer Vladimir Klimov was sent to France to obtain a license for local production of the 12Y. A series of design changes were added to cope with cold weather operation, and the engine entered production in 1935 as the [[Klimov M-100]] with about 750&nbsp;hp (560&nbsp;kW).<ref>Kotelnikov 2005, p. 136.</ref> However a series of continual upgrades increased the allowable RPM from the 12Y's fairly low 2,400 to 2,700, thereby increasing power to 1,100&nbsp;hp (820&nbsp;kW). The resulting design, the '''[[Klimov M-105]] (VK-105)''' became one of the major Soviet engine designs during the war, powering all [[Yakovlev]] fighters.\n\n==Variants==\nTabulated data from Lage 2004<ref name=Lage>Lage, 2004, p.486-7</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Type 73 Hispano 12Y engines.
