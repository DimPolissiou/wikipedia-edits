Nearby localities include, [[Mahardah]], [[Tremseh]], [[Kafr Hud]], [[Khunayzir]] and [[Halfaya]].

[[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Syria Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS). Hama Governorate. {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Crusades]], the town was a fortress, ruled by the [[Munqidhites|Banu Munqidh]] family. It played an important part in the Christian and Muslim politics of the crusades.\n\n==Location==\nShaizar is located at a strategically vital crossing point on the [[Orontes River]], 28 km to the northwest of [[Hama]].<ref name=\"come\">[http://www.cometosyria.com/en/pages/Shaizar+Syria/50/38  \"Shaizar\"] at www.cometosyria.com, accessed 3 May 2018</ref>\n\n==Name evolution==\n[[File:Shayzar3.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of Shaizar]]\n\nIn the [[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC) it is mentioned as Senzar or Sezar.\n\nTo the [[Greeks]] it was known as Sidzara, but during the [[Seleucid empire]] it was renamed Larissa, after the town [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (Greece) from which many colonists came.\n\nIt reverted to its earlier name under the [[Roman Empire]] and was known as Sezer under the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nThe Crusaders rendered the city's name in Latin as Caesarea. This name had not been used in any earlier period, and was derived from the Crusaders mistakenly identifying this city as being [[Caesarea Mazaca]], a place renowned in Christian history as the home of Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]].\n\nShaizar's ruins are known as Saijar in modern Arabic.\n\n==History==\n===Bronze Age===\nShaizar is mentioned as Senzar or Sezar in the [[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC).\n\n===Hellenistic period===\nThe region was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333-332 BC. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (first century BC) records local legends attributing the establishment of the town by one of his cavalry regiments originating from [[Thessaly]].<ref name=\"come\"/> During the [[Seleucid dynasty]] the town was renamed Larissa, after the town in Thessaly from which many colonists came.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Roman period===\nThe Roman armies led by [[Pompey]] conquered Syria in 64 BC.\n\nSyria was briefly occupied by Republican-Parthian forces under the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince [[Pacorus I]].\n\n===Byzantine and Early Arab periods===\nThe city remained part of the Christianised empire, known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], under the name of Sezer.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nShaizar fell to the [[Arabs]] in 638 and frequently passed from Arab to Byzantine control. It was sacked in 969 by Byzantine emperor [[Nicephorus II]], and was captured by [[Basil II]] in 999, after which it became the southern border of the Byzantine Empire and was administered by the Bishop of Shaizar.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A [[Fatimid]] castle was standing at Shaizar by the time the Byzantines recaptured the town.<ref name=\"come\"/>\n\nIt was lost to the Banu Munqidh in 1081 when 'Ali ibn Munqidh bought it from the bishop. The Byzantines besieged it numerous times after this but failed to recover it.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Crusaders===\nThe Franks arrived in Syria in 1098 during the [[First Crusade]]. The interaction between the [[Crusader states]] and the Banu Munqidh rulers of Shaizar consisted of a series of wars and alliances.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Munqidhite Shaizar (1081\u20131157)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Shayzar4.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of Shaizar]]\n{{see also|Battle of Shaizar (1111)|Siege of Shaizar}}\n\nThe Munqidhites controlled territory east of Shaizar, across the [[al-Ansariyah mountains]] to the [[Mediterranean]] coast, from the coastal cities of [[Latakia]] in the north to [[Tortosa]] in the south.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], the emir assisted the Crusaders passing through his land, giving them horses and food and other provisions. After the crusade it was bordered by the crusader [[Principality of Antioch]] and was subject to raids from both Antioch and the [[County of Tripoli]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWhen the Crusaders briefly conquered [[Qalaat al-Madiq]], a fortress to the northwest of Shaizar and overlooking ancient [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], in 1106, the Banu Munqidh clan harassed them from their base in Shaizar.<ref name=\"come\"/>\n\nIn 1106 the Munqidhite emirs Murshid and Sultan defeated [[William-Jordan]] of Tripoli, and in 1108 and 1110 they had to bribe [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] to leave. Tancred, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], and [[Bertrand of Tripoli]] besieged the city during the [[Battle of Shaizar (1111)|battle of Shaizar]] of 1111 for two weeks, but returned home when the army of [[Mawdud of Mosul]] cut off their access to food and water. Tancred nevertheless built a castle nearby on Tell ibn Ma'shar, in order to keep Shaizar under close watch.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWhen [[Ridwan of Aleppo]] died in 1113, Shaizar was inundated by many of his [[Order of Assassins|Assassin]] supporters that were expelled from the city by his son [[Alp Arsl\u0101n al-Akhras|Alp Arslan al-Akras]]. Shaizar participated in [[Ilghazi]]'s campaign against Antioch in 1119. When [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] was taken captive by the [[Artuqids|Artuqid]] [[Belek Ghazi]] outside [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1123, he was held at Shaizar until his release the next year.  As part of his ransom he was forced to give up his daughter [[Ioveta of Bethany|Ioveta]] as a hostage, who was also held at Shaizar until her own ransom in 1125. As Shaizar was a friendly state, Baldwin was allowed to visit his daughter there, but Shaizar was also friendly to its Muslim neighbours, and in 1125 was incorporated into the territory of [[Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi]], [[List of rulers of Mosul#Seljuk%20Atabegs|atabeg of Mosul]]. When [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] succeeded-Bursuqi's son in Mosul in 1127 and claimed Aleppo as well, Shaizar recognized his suzerainty.\n\nIn 1137, Byzantine emperor [[John II Comnenus]] arrived to impose Byzantine authority on Antioch, and promised [[Raymond of Antioch]] a principality consisting of Shaizar, Aleppo, [[Homs]], and [[Hama]] if Antioch was returned to the Empire. In April 1138 the Byzantine army led the [[siege of Shaizar]], but Raymond and [[Joscelin II of Edessa]] did not assist the emperor.  Zengi soon arrived to relieve the fortress in May. The emir preferred Byzantine control to Zengid, and offered to recognize John as his overlord. Neither John or Zengi ever really enforced their authority there and Shaizar remained independent.\n\nThe emirate lasted until the enormous [[1157 Hama earthquake|earthquake of 1157]], during which the citadel collapsed, killing almost the entire family, who had assembled there to celebrate a circumcision. The only survivors out of the whole family were the wife of emir, and the emir's nephew [[Usama ibn Munqidh]], the famed poet-knight who was on a diplomatic mission to [[Damascus]].\n\n====Description of the city====\nReferring to the crusader siege of Shaizar in 1157, [[William of Tyre]] writes:\n\n: \"The city of Shayzar lies upon the same Orontes river which flows by [[Antioch]]. It is called by some Caesarea, and by them is believed to be the famous metropolis of [[Kayseri|Cappadocia]] over which the distinguished teacher [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil]] once presided; but those who hold this view are in grave error. For that Caesarea is a fifteen days journey or more from Antioch. This city is in [[Coele-Syria|Coelesyria]], a province which is separated from Cappadocia by many intervening provinces. Nor is the name Caesarea, but rather Caesara. It is one of the suffragan cities belonging to the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch|patriarchate of Antioch]]. It is very conveniently situated. The lower part extends along the plain, while upon the heights of the upper part is the citadel, fairly long in extent but rather narrow. It is well fortified, for in addition to its natural defenses, the river protects it on one side and the city on the other, so that it is entirely inaccessible.\"<ref name=\":0\">[[William of Tyre]], ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea'', trans.

Krey, [[Columbia University Press]], 1943, bk. 18, ch. 18, pp. 266-267.</ref>\n\n[[Fulcher of Chartres]], an eyewitness to the siege in 1111, did not know the classical Roman or Greek name for the site, and noted that the Turks called it \"Sisara\", \"but the inhabitants of the country commonly call it 'Chezar'.\"<ref>[[Fulcher of Chartres]], ''A History of the Expedition to Jerusalem'', trans. Frances Rita Ryan, University of Tennessee Press, 1969, bk. II, ch. XLV.7-9, pp. 202-203.</ref>\n\n====Life in the city====\n\nRegarding the citizens, William of Tyre says they \"had but little knowledge of arms; their attention was devoted almost entirely to trading.\" Many of them were Christians, whom William considered to be suffering as slaves under their Muslim rulers, but the Munqidhites seem to have been tolerant lords and both Christians and Muslims of various sects lived there peacefully.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA very lively account of life in Shaizar, and various other places in the Muslim world, was written by the prince Usama ibn Munqidh, titled [[Kitab al-I'tibar]], and gives great insight into Muslim life in the 12th century.\n\nThe Munqidhite emirs are shown as patrons of literature, who delight in hunting and other sports, as well as delighting in making war on, and negotiating peace with, their Christian and Muslim neighbours.\n\n====Munqidh emirs of Shaizar====\nShaizar was ruler by the [[Banu Munqidh|Banu Munquid]] from 1059-1157.  The emirs were:\n\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Reign of Ali|Sultan ibn 'Ali ibn al-Muqallad ibn Munqidh al-Kinani]] (1059-1081)\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Struggle for Shayzar|'Izz ad-Dawla Sadid al-Mulk ibn Munqidh]] (1081-1082)\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Reign of Nasr|'Izz ad-Dawla abu-l-Murhaf Nasr ibn Munqidh]] (1082-1098)\n*[[Usama ibn Munqidh#Early life|Majd ad-Din abu Salamah Murshid ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh]] (1098-1137; the Latin ''Machedolus'', father of [[Usama ibn Munqidh]])\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Reign of Sultan|'Izz ad-Din abu-l-'Asakir Sultan ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh]] (1098-1154)\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Suzerainty of the Zengids|Taj ad-Dawla Nasr ad-Din Muhammad ibn abu-l-Asakir ibn Munqidh]] (1154-1157).\n\n====Usama ibn Munqidh====\n[[Usama ibn Munqidh]] was a [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim]] poet, author, ''[[Furusiyya|faris]]'' (knight), and diplomat from the Banu Munqidh dynasty of Shaizar in northern [[Syria]]. His life coincided with the rise of several medieval Muslim dynasties, the arrival of the [[First Crusade]], and the establishment of the [[Crusader states]].\nHe was born in Shaizar, \u015eeyzer. He was the nephew and potential successor of the emir of Shaizar, but was exiled in 1131 and spent the rest of his life serving other leaders. He was a courtier to the [[Burid dynasty|Burids]], [[Zengid dynasty|Zengids]], and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] in [[Damascus]], serving the [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Nur ad-Din Zengi|Nur ad-Din]], and [[Saladin]] over a period of almost fifty years. He also served the [[Fatimid]] court in Cairo, as well as the [[Artuqids]] in [[Hisn Kayfa]]. He travelled extensively in Arab lands, visiting Egypt, Syria, Palestine and along the Tigris River, and went on pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. He often meddled in the politics of the courts in which he served, and he was exiled from both Damascus and Cairo.\n\nDuring and immediately after his life, he was most famous as a poet and ''adib'' (a \"man of letters\"). He wrote many poetry anthologies, such as the ''Kitab al-'Asa'' (\"Book of the Staff\"), ''Lubab al-Adab'' (\"Kernels of Refinement\"), and ''al-Manazil wa'l-Diyar'' (\"Dwellings and Abodes\"), and collections of his own original poetry. In modern times, he is remembered more for his ''[[Kitab al-I'tibar]]'' (\"Book of Learning by Example\" or \"Book of Contemplation\"), which contains lengthy descriptions of the Crusaders, whom he interacted with on many occasions, and some of whom he considered friends.\n\nMost of his family was killed in an [[1157 Hama earthquake|earthquake at Shaizar]] in 1157. He died in Damascus in 1188, at the age of 93.\n\n===Assassin, Zengid and Mamluk periods (1158-1260)===\nThe [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] then took control of the ruins, and they were defeated by the Crusaders in 1158, but disputes forced the Crusaders to abandon the siege. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] then incorporated the remains into his territory and rebuilt the city. Shaizar was destroyed again by an earthquake in 1170 and the remnants were taken by [[Saladin]] in 1174. They were rebuilt again, but in 1241 the city was sacked by the [[Khwarezmians]]. The [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] captured and rebuilt the city in 1260.\n\n===Modern period===\nShaizar castle is no longer inhabited today.{{dubious|probably referring just tothe castle?

Nearby localities include, [[Mahardah]], [[Tremseh]], [[Kafr Hud]], [[Khunayzir]] and [[Halfaya]]. According to the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Syria Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), Shaizar had a population of 5,953 in the 2004 census.<ref name=\"CBS\">[http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB05-20-2004.htm General Census of Population and Housing 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112210007/http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB05-20-2004.htm |date=2013-01-12 }}. [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Syria Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS). Hama Governorate. {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Crusades]], the town was a fortress, ruled by the [[Munqidhites|Banu Munqidh]] family. It played an important part in the Christian and Muslim politics of the crusades.\n\n==Location==\nShaizar is located at a strategically vital crossing point on the [[Orontes River]], 28 km to the northwest of [[Hama]].<ref name=\"come\">[http://www.cometosyria.com/en/pages/Shaizar+Syria/50/38  \"Shaizar\"] at www.cometosyria.com, accessed 3 May 2018</ref>\n\n==Name evolution==\n[[File:Shayzar3.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of Shaizar]]\n\nIn the [[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC) it is mentioned as Senzar or Sezar.\n\nTo the [[Greeks]] it was known as Sidzara, but during the [[Seleucid empire]] it was renamed Larissa, after the town [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (Greece) from which many colonists came.\n\nIt reverted to its earlier name under the [[Roman Empire]] and was known as Sezer under the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nThe Crusaders rendered the city's name in Latin as Caesarea. This name had not been used in any earlier period, and was derived from the Crusaders mistakenly identifying this city as being [[Caesarea Mazaca]], a place renowned in Christian history as the home of Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]].\n\nShaizar's ruins are known as Saijar in modern Arabic.\n\n==History==\n===Bronze Age===\nShaizar is mentioned as Senzar or Sezar in the [[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC).\n\n===Hellenistic period===\nThe region was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333-332 BC. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (first century BC) records local legends attributing the establishment of the town by one of his cavalry regiments originating from [[Thessaly]].<ref name=\"come\"/> During the [[Seleucid dynasty]] the town was renamed Larissa, after the town in Thessaly from which many colonists came.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Roman period===\nThe Roman armies led by [[Pompey]] conquered Syria in 64 BC.\n\nSyria was briefly occupied by Republican-Parthian forces under the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince [[Pacorus I]].\n\n===Byzantine and Early Arab periods===\nThe city remained part of the Christianised empire, known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], under the name of Sezer.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nShaizar fell to the [[Arabs]] in 638 and frequently passed from Arab to Byzantine control. It was sacked in 969 by Byzantine emperor [[Nicephorus II]], and was captured by [[Basil II]] in 999, after which it became the southern border of the Byzantine Empire and was administered by the Bishop of Shaizar.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A [[Fatimid]] castle was standing at Shaizar by the time the Byzantines recaptured the town.<ref name=\"come\"/>\n\nIt was lost to the Banu Munqidh in 1081 when 'Ali ibn Munqidh bought it from the bishop. The Byzantines besieged it numerous times after this but failed to recover it.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Crusaders===\nThe Franks arrived in Syria in 1098 during the [[First Crusade]]. The interaction between the [[Crusader states]] and the Banu Munqidh rulers of Shaizar consisted of a series of wars and alliances.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Munqidhite Shaizar (1081-1157)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Shayzar4.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of Shaizar]]\n{{see also|Battle of Shaizar (1111)|Siege of Shaizar}}\n\nThe Munqidhites controlled territory east of Shaizar, across the [[al-Ansariyah mountains]] to the [[Mediterranean]] coast, from the coastal cities of [[Latakia]] in the north to [[Tortosa]] in the south.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], the emir assisted the Crusaders passing through his land, giving them horses and food and other provisions. After the crusade it was bordered by the crusader [[Principality of Antioch]] and was subject to raids from both Antioch and the [[County of Tripoli]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWhen the Crusaders briefly conquered [[Qalaat al-Madiq]], a fortress to the northwest of Shaizar and overlooking ancient [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], in 1106, the Banu Munqidh clan harassed them from their base in Shaizar.<ref name=\"come\"/>\n\nIn 1106 the Munqidhite emirs Murshid and Sultan defeated [[William-Jordan]] of Tripoli, and in 1108 and 1110 they had to bribe [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] to leave. Tancred, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], and [[Bertrand of Tripoli]] besieged the city during the [[Battle of Shaizar (1111)|battle of Shaizar]] of 1111 for two weeks, but returned home when the army of [[Mawdud of Mosul]] cut off their access to food and water. Tancred nevertheless built a castle nearby on Tell ibn Ma'shar, in order to keep Shaizar under close watch.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWhen [[Ridwan of Aleppo]] died in 1113, Shaizar was inundated by many of his [[Order of Assassins|Assassin]] supporters that were expelled from the city by his son [[Alp Arsl\u0101n al-Akhras|Alp Arslan al-Akras]]. Shaizar participated in [[Ilghazi]]'s campaign against Antioch in 1119. When [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] was taken captive by the [[Artuqids|Artuqid]] [[Belek Ghazi]] outside [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1123, he was held at Shaizar until his release the next year.  As part of his ransom he was forced to give up his daughter [[Ioveta of Bethany|Ioveta]] as a hostage, who was also held at Shaizar until her own ransom in 1125. As Shaizar was a friendly state, Baldwin was allowed to visit his daughter there, but Shaizar was also friendly to its Muslim neighbours, and in 1125 was incorporated into the territory of [[Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi]], [[List of rulers of Mosul#Seljuk%20Atabegs|atabeg of Mosul]]. When [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] succeeded-Bursuqi's son in Mosul in 1127 and claimed Aleppo as well, Shaizar recognized his suzerainty.\n\nIn 1137, Byzantine emperor [[John II Comnenus]] arrived to impose Byzantine authority on Antioch, and promised [[Raymond of Antioch]] a principality consisting of Shaizar, Aleppo, [[Homs]], and [[Hama]] if Antioch was returned to the Empire. In April 1138 the Byzantine army led the [[siege of Shaizar]], but Raymond and [[Joscelin II of Edessa]] did not assist the emperor.  Zengi soon arrived to relieve the fortress in May. The emir preferred Byzantine control to Zengid, and offered to recognize John as his overlord. Neither John or Zengi ever really enforced their authority there and Shaizar remained independent.\n\nThe emirate lasted until the enormous [[1157 Hama earthquake|earthquake of 1157]], during which the citadel collapsed, killing almost the entire family, who had assembled there to celebrate a circumcision. The only survivors out of the whole family were the wife of emir, and the emir's nephew [[Usama ibn Munqidh]], the famed poet-knight who was on a diplomatic mission to [[Damascus]].\n\n====Description of the city====\nReferring to the crusader siege of Shaizar in 1157, [[William of Tyre]] writes:\n\n: \"The city of Shayzar lies upon the same Orontes river which flows by [[Antioch]]. It is called by some Caesarea, and by them is believed to be the famous metropolis of [[Kayseri|Cappadocia]] over which the distinguished teacher [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil]] once presided; but those who hold this view are in grave error. For that Caesarea is a fifteen days journey or more from Antioch. This city is in [[Coele-Syria|Coelesyria]], a province which is separated from Cappadocia by many intervening provinces. Nor is the name Caesarea, but rather Caesara. It is one of the suffragan cities belonging to the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch|patriarchate of Antioch]]. It is very conveniently situated. The lower part extends along the plain, while upon the heights of the upper part is the citadel, fairly long in extent but rather narrow. It is well fortified, for in addition to its natural defenses, the river protects it on one side and the city on the other, so that it is entirely inaccessible.\"<ref name=\":0\">[[William of Tyre]], ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea'', trans. E.A. Babcock and A.C. Krey, [[Columbia University Press]], 1943, bk. 18, ch. 18, pp. 266-267.</ref>\n\n[[Fulcher of Chartres]], an eyewitness to the siege in 1111, did not know the classical Roman or Greek name for the site, and noted that the Turks called it \"Sisara\", \"but the inhabitants of the country commonly call it 'Chezar'.\"<ref>[[Fulcher of Chartres]], ''A History of the Expedition to Jerusalem'', trans. Frances Rita Ryan, University of Tennessee Press, 1969, bk. II, ch. XLV.7-9, pp. 202-203.</ref>\n\n====Life in the city====\n\nRegarding the citizens, William of Tyre says they \"had but little knowledge of arms; their attention was devoted almost entirely to trading.\" Many of them were Christians, whom William considered to be suffering as slaves under their Muslim rulers, but the Munqidhites seem to have been tolerant lords and both Christians and Muslims of various sects lived there peacefully.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA very lively account of life in Shaizar, and various other places in the Muslim world, was written by the prince Usama ibn Munqidh, titled [[Kitab al-I'tibar]], and gives great insight into Muslim life in the 12th century.\n\nThe Munqidhite emirs are shown as patrons of literature, who delight in hunting and other sports, as well as delighting in making war on, and negotiating peace with, their Christian and Muslim neighbours.\n\n====Munqidh emirs of Shaizar====\nShaizar was ruler by the [[Banu Munqidh|Banu Munquid]] from 1059-1157.  The emirs were:\n\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Reign of Ali|Sultan ibn 'Ali ibn al-Muqallad ibn Munqidh al-Kinani]] (1059-1081)\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Struggle for Shayzar|'Izz ad-Dawla Sadid al-Mulk ibn Munqidh]] (1081-1082)\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Reign of Nasr|'Izz ad-Dawla abu-l-Murhaf Nasr ibn Munqidh]] (1082-1098)\n*[[Usama ibn Munqidh#Early life|Majd ad-Din abu Salamah Murshid ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh]] (1098-1137; the Latin ''Machedolus'', father of [[Usama ibn Munqidh]])\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Reign of Sultan|'Izz ad-Din abu-l-'Asakir Sultan ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh]] (1098-1154)\n*[[Banu Munqidh#Suzerainty of the Zengids|Taj ad-Dawla Nasr ad-Din Muhammad ibn abu-l-Asakir ibn Munqidh]] (1154-1157).\n\n====Usama ibn Munqidh====\n[[Usama ibn Munqidh]] was a [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim]] poet, author, ''[[Furusiyya|faris]]'' (knight), and diplomat from the Banu Munqidh dynasty of Shaizar in northern [[Syria]]. His life coincided with the rise of several medieval Muslim dynasties, the arrival of the [[First Crusade]], and the establishment of the [[Crusader states]].\nHe was born in Shaizar, \u015eeyzer. He was the nephew and potential successor of the emir of Shaizar, but was exiled in 1131 and spent the rest of his life serving other leaders. He was a courtier to the [[Burid dynasty|Burids]], [[Zengid dynasty|Zengids]], and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] in [[Damascus]], serving the [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Nur ad-Din Zengi|Nur ad-Din]], and [[Saladin]] over a period of almost fifty years. He also served the [[Fatimid]] court in Cairo, as well as the [[Artuqids]] in [[Hisn Kayfa]]. He travelled extensively in Arab lands, visiting Egypt, Syria, Palestine and along the Tigris River, and went on pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. He often meddled in the politics of the courts in which he served, and he was exiled from both Damascus and Cairo.\n\nDuring and immediately after his life, he was most famous as a poet and ''adib'' (a \"man of letters\"). He wrote many poetry anthologies, such as the ''Kitab al-'Asa'' (\"Book of the Staff\"), ''Lubab al-Adab'' (\"Kernels of Refinement\"), and ''al-Manazil wa'l-Diyar'' (\"Dwellings and Abodes\"), and collections of his own original poetry. In modern times, he is remembered more for his ''[[Kitab al-I'tibar]]'' (\"Book of Learning by Example\" or \"Book of Contemplation\"), which contains lengthy descriptions of the Crusaders, whom he interacted with on many occasions, and some of whom he considered friends.\n\nMost of his family was killed in an [[1157 Hama earthquake|earthquake at Shaizar]] in 1157. He died in Damascus in 1188, at the age of 93.\n\n===Assassin, Zengid and Mamluk periods (1158-1260)===\nThe [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] then took control of the ruins, and they were defeated by the Crusaders in 1158, but disputes forced the Crusaders to abandon the siege. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] then incorporated the remains into his territory and rebuilt the city. Shaizar was destroyed again by an earthquake in 1170 and the remnants were taken by [[Saladin]] in 1174. They were rebuilt again, but in 1241 the city was sacked by the [[Khwarezmians]]. The [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] captured and rebuilt the city in 1260.\n\n===Modern period===\nShaizar castle is no longer inhabited today.{{dubious|probably referring just tothe castle?

The [[Free Syrian Army]] repelled a series of government assaults between March and June 2012, despite the government's ability to execute combined arms operations involving armored vehicles, artillery, and helicopter gunships.<ref>Mariam Karouny, \u201cSoldiers wary as residents rage in Syria\u2019s Idlib,\u201d Reuters, 10 May 2012.</ref> The city was retaken by the government on 11 August 2012.<ref>{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57491691/syrian-opposition-leader-calls-for-no-fly-zone |title=Syrian opposition leader calls for no-fly zone |publisher=CBS News |date=2012-08-12 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\nBy late July 2013, rebels controlled parts of Ariha, while government forces manned three checkpoints inside the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/deadly-fighting-rages-across-syria/story-fni0xqlk-1226682876075 |title=Deadly fighting rages across Syria |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|fanar}}On 25 May 2014, the [[al-Nusra Front]] and the [[Suqour al-Sham Brigades|Suqour al-Sham Brigade]] launched a two-pronged assault on the southern Ariha hills with the objective of seizing two military outposts; the Fanar Restaurant Checkpoint and the Shami Military Installation sit atop two peaks in the area south of the town and control access to the southern neighborhoods of Ariha via two access roads. At 6 in the morning, the al-Nusra Front with support from Suqour al-Sham detonated four [[SVBIED]]s against government infrastructure targets. All four SVBIEDs exploded in the Jabal al-Arbaeen area on the southern outskirts of Ariha. The first SVBIED, driven by [[Moner Mohammad Abu Salha]], a 22-year-old American man from Florida, approached the Fanar Restaurant Checkpoint from the southwest along a dirt road. The 16-ton armored truck completely destroyed the checkpoint and caused it to crumble in on itself, leaving only few survivors to defend it. Over the course of the battle, two more SVBIEDs exploded to the west of Fanar, targeting the Shami Military Complex. The first two SVBIEDs targeted the Commander'\u2019s building and Shami Checkpoint. One final VBIED targeted the Aram building, however the driver of the VBIED was able to park his vehicle and escape uninjured. The four explosions were followed by a barrage of artillery and gunfire. By the end of the day Jabhat al-Nusra and Suquor al-Sham had seized both the Fanar and Shami Checkpoints in one of the largest coordinated SVBIED attacks since the beginning of 2014.<ref name=iswidlib>{{cite journal | url=http://iswsyria.blogspot.fr/2014/07/rebel-operations-in-idlib-province.html | title=Rebel Operations in Idlib Province during the Spring of 2014 | author=Nate Petrocine | journal=Institute for the Study of War |date=July 2014}}</ref> However, on 13 October 2014, it was reported that rebels destroyed a government [[Armored personnel carrier|APC]] at al-Fanar Checkpoint.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://rfsmediaoffice.com/en/daily-report-monday-13-october-2014/ | title=Daily Report: Monday 13 October 2014 | author= | journal=RFS media office |date=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|qiyasat}}On 24 August 2014, rebels captured Ariha.

At 6 in the morning, the al-Nusra Front with support from Suqour al-Sham detonated four [[SVBIED]]s against government infrastructure targets. All four SVBIEDs exploded in the Jabal al-Arbaeen area on the southern outskirts of Ariha. The first SVBIED, driven by [[Moner Mohammad Abu Salha]], a 22-year-old American man from Florida, approached the Fanar Restaurant Checkpoint from the southwest along a dirt road. The 16-ton armored truck completely destroyed the checkpoint and caused it to crumble in on itself, leaving only few survivors to defend it. Over the course of the battle, two more SVBIEDs exploded to the west of Fanar, targeting the Shami Military Complex. The first two SVBIEDs targeted the Commander'\u2019s building and Shami Checkpoint. One final VBIED targeted the Aram building, however the driver of the VBIED was able to park his vehicle and escape uninjured. The four explosions were followed by a barrage of artillery and gunfire. By the end of the day Jabhat al-Nusra and Suquor al-Sham had seized both the Fanar and Shami Checkpoints in one of the largest coordinated SVBIED attacks since the beginning of 2014.<ref name=iswidlib>{{cite journal | url=http://iswsyria.blogspot.fr/2014/07/rebel-operations-in-idlib-province.html | title=Rebel Operations in Idlib Province during the Spring of 2014 | author=Nate Petrocine | journal=Institute for the Study of War |date=July 2014}}</ref> However, on 13 October 2014, it was reported that rebels destroyed a government [[Armored personnel carrier|APC]] at al-Fanar Checkpoint.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://rfsmediaoffice.com/en/daily-report-monday-13-october-2014/ | title=Daily Report: Monday 13 October 2014 | author= | journal=RFS media office |date=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|qiyasat}}On 24 August 2014, rebels captured Ariha.

In modern times, the residents of the village are mostly employed in the civil service or in agriculture, with the main crops being wheat, barley and [[olive]]s. The cultivation of the latter is a relatively recent development. Zardana's total land area roughly consists of 2,000 [[hectare]]s. The health center provides medical care for the residents of Zardana and the surrounding villages. Zardana contains two primary schools and two secondary schools.<ref name=\"eidleb\">Asi, Ahmed.

In June of that year, [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] defeated the Muslim leader [[Ridwan of Aleppo]] with the help of Crusader forces based in Zardana. Zardana, which was a strategic fortress between Antioch and Aleppo, was apparently reoccupied by the Muslims soon after.<ref>Asbridge, p. 51.</ref> However, in 1110, [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] easily captured the town from the Muslims after the successful siege he laid against nearby [[Atarib]]. The two towns subsequently marked the eastern frontier of the Principality of Antioch.<ref>Asbridge, p. 65.</ref> A few years later both towns suffered severe damage as a result of an earthquake.<ref>Asbridge, p. 70.</ref> From the time of its conquest by the Crusaders, Robert fitz-Fulk, served as the lord of Zardana, and due to the town's strategic value, became a powerful figure in the Principality of Antioch.<ref>Asbridge, p. 159.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Ager-Sanguinis.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic depiction of the \"[[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]],\" a Muslim victory which included the capture of Zardana, from 1337]]\n\nIn early August 1119, the combined Muslim forces of [[Ilghazi|Il-ghazi]], the [[Artukid]] ruler of [[Mardin]], and [[Toghtekin]], the [[Buyid]] ruler of [[Damascus]], marched on Zardana after capturing Atarib. The Crusader garrison in the town put up resistance against Il-ghazi's army until surrendering on 12 August. The capture of Atarib and Zardana was a decisive Muslim victory, known as the \"[[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]],\" and strengthened the defense of Aleppo. Robert was captured by the Muslim army as he approached Zardana and was later executed in Aleppo.

In modern times, the residents of the village are mostly employed in the civil service or in agriculture, with the main crops being wheat, barley and [[olive]]s. The cultivation of the latter is a relatively recent development. Zardana's total land area roughly consists of 2,000 [[hectare]]s. The health center provides medical care for the residents of Zardana and the surrounding villages. Zardana contains two primary schools and two secondary schools.<ref name=\"eidleb\">Asi, Ahmed.

In June of that year, [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] defeated the Muslim leader [[Ridwan of Aleppo]] with the help of Crusader forces based in Zardana. Zardana, which was a strategic fortress between Antioch and Aleppo, was apparently reoccupied by the Muslims soon after.<ref>Asbridge, p. 51.</ref> However, in 1110, [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] easily captured the town from the Muslims after the successful siege he laid against nearby [[Atarib]]. The two towns subsequently marked the eastern frontier of the Principality of Antioch.<ref>Asbridge, p. 65.</ref> A few years later both towns suffered severe damage as a result of an earthquake.<ref>Asbridge, p. 70.</ref> From the time of its conquest by the Crusaders, Robert fitz-Fulk, served as the lord of Zardana, and due to the town's strategic value, became a powerful figure in the Principality of Antioch.<ref>Asbridge, p. 159.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Ager-Sanguinis.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic depiction of the \"[[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]],\" a Muslim victory which included the capture of Zardana, from 1337]]\n\nIn early August 1119, the combined Muslim forces of [[Ilghazi|Il-ghazi]], the [[Artukid]] ruler of [[Mardin]], and [[Toghtekin]], the [[Buyid]] ruler of [[Damascus]], marched on Zardana after capturing Atarib. The Crusader garrison in the town put up resistance against Il-ghazi's army until surrendering on 12 August. The capture of Atarib and Zardana was a decisive Muslim victory, known as the \"[[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]],\" and strengthened the defense of Aleppo. Robert was captured by the Muslim army as he approached Zardana and was later executed in Aleppo. [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] managed to capture Zardana from the Muslims in the early-1120s and by the time [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond II]] became ruler of Antioch in 1126.

Tancred had a great-grandfather with the same name, [[Tancred of Hauteville]]; since both Tancreds were from the house of [[Hauteville family|Hauteville]], they may be confused.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{expand section|date=December 2011}}\nTancred was a son of [[Emma of Hauteville]] and [[Odo the Good Marquis]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Robert Guiscard]] and Guiscard's first wife [[Alberada of Buonalbergo]]. Emma was also a sister of [[Bohemond I of Antioch]].\n\n===First Crusade===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nIn 1096, Tancred joined his maternal uncle Bohemond on the [[First Crusade]], and the two made their way to [[Constantinople]]. There, he was pressured to swear an oath to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]], promising to give back any conquered land to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Although the other leaders did not intend to keep their oaths, Tancred refused to swear the oath altogether. He participated in the [[siege of Nicaea]] in 1097, but the city was taken by Alexius' army after secret negotiations with the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Because of this, Tancred was very distrustful of the Byzantines. \n\nIn 1097 the Crusaders divided their forces at [[Heraclea Cybistra]] and Tancred entered the Levant by passing south through the [[Cilician Gates]].<ref name=\"tomaschek\">{{cite book|last1=Tomaschek |first1=W.| title=Zur historischen Topographie von Kleinasien im Mittelalter| date=1891|publisher=Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften| location=Vienna|page=86}}</ref> He displayed the skills of a brilliant tactician by seizing five of the most important sites in Cilicia Pedias, which included the ancient cities of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] and [[Adana]], the great emporium at [[Mopsuestia]], and the strategic castles at [[Sarvandikar]] and [[Anazarbus]].<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII | date=1987 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=67, 69-70, 199-200, 216}}</ref> The last three settlements were annexed to the Principality of Antioch. During their fourteen-year occupation of Anazarbus the Crusaders built the magnificent donjon atop the center of the fortified outcrop. At Sarvandikar, which controlled the strategic Amanus Pass, Tancred imprisoned [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Saint-Gilles]] in 1101/02.<ref>Matthew of Edessa, ''Recueil des historiens des croisades, Documents arm\u00e9niens'', vol. 1, reprint: Farnborough, 1967, p. 57.</ref> \n\nHe assisted in the [[siege of Antioch]] in 1098. One year later, during the assault on [[Jerusalem]], Tancred, along with [[Gaston IV of B\u00e9arn]], claimed to have been the first [[Crusade]]r to enter the city on July 15. However, the first crusader to enter Jerusalem was Ludolf of Tournai, and he was followed by his brother Englebert. When the city fell, Tancred gave his banner to a group of the citizens who had fled to the roof of the [[Temple of Solomon]]. This should have assured their safety, but they were massacred, along with many others, during the sack of the city. The author of the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' (Deeds of the Franks) records that, when Tancred realised this, he was \"greatly angered\". When the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] was established, Tancred became Prince of Galilee.\n\n===Regent of Antioch===\n[[File:Tancr\u00e8de de Hauteville.jpg||thumb|150px|right|Tancred of Hauteville, Prince of Galilea.]]\nIn 1100, Tancred became regent of Antioch when Bohemond was taken prisoner by the [[Danishmends]] at the [[Battle of Melitene]]. He expanded the territory of the Latin principality by capturing land from the Byzantines, although, over the next decade, Alexius attempted, unsuccessfully, to bring him under Byzantine control.  In 1104, he also took control of the [[County of Edessa]] when [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] was taken captive after the [[Battle of Harran]]. After Baldwin's release in late 1108, he had to fight Tancred (probably early 1109) to regain control of the county; Tancred was eventually defeated and returned to Antioch. After Harran, Bohemond returned to Europe to recruit more Crusaders, again leaving his nephew as regent in [[Antioch]]. Tancred's victory over [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan of Aleppo]] at the [[Battle of Artah]] in 1105 allowed the Latin principality to recover some its territories east of the [[Orontes River]].<ref>Smail, p. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1108, Tancred refused to honour the [[Treaty of Devol]], in which Bohemond swore an oath of fealty to Alexius, and for decades afterwards Antioch remained independent of the Byzantine Empire.  In 1110, he brought [[Krak des Chevaliers]] under his control, which would later become an important castle in the [[County of Tripoli]]. Tancred remained regent in Antioch in the name of [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond II]] until his death in 1112 during a [[typhoid]] epidemic. He had married [[Cecile of France]], but died childless.\n\nThe ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]'' is a biography of Tancred written in [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Ralph of Caen]], a Norman who joined the First Crusade and served under Tancred and Bohemond. An English translation was co-published in 2005 by Bernard S. Bachrach and David S. Bachrach.\n\n[[Image:Tancred and Erminia.JPG|thumb|350px|right|[[Nicolas Poussin]]'s ''Tancred and Erminia'' ([[Hermitage Museum]])]]\n\n==In fiction==\nTancred appears as a character in [[Torquato Tasso]]'s 16th-century poem ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', in which he is portrayed as an epic hero and given a fictional love interest, the pagan warrior-maiden Clorinda. He is also loved by the Princess [[Erminia]] of Antioch. Portions of Tasso's verses were set by [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in his 1624 dramatic work ''[[Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]''. He also appears in one of the scenes in [[Imre Mad\u00e1ch]]'s ''[[Az ember trag\u00e9di\u00e1ja|The Tragedy of Man]]''. In [[Edwin Thomas (novelist)|Tom Harper]]'s ''Siege of Heaven'' he is depicted as a violent psychopath. His portrayal is similar although slightly more humorous in [[Alfred Duggan]]'s novel ''Count Bohemond''.\n\nTancred also appears as one of the Crusade leaders in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'' who returned to [[Constantinople]] from [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] to ensure a fair contest between Count Robert and his challenger. The novel ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred, or the New Crusade]]'' by [[Benjamin Disraeli]] centres around the adventures of an imagined modern descendant and namesake of the Prince of Galilee. Rossini's opera ''[[Tancredi]]'' is based on Tasso, via [[Voltaire]]'s play ''Tancr\u00e8de'' of 1759.\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Edwards, Robert W., ''The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII'', Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University (1987). {{ISBN|0-88402-163-7}}\n*Robert Lawrence Nicholson, ''Tancred: A Study of His Career and Work''.

Tancred had a great-grandfather with the same name, [[Tancred of Hauteville]]; since both Tancreds were from the house of [[Hauteville family|Hauteville]], they may be confused.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{expand section|date=December 2011}}\nTancred was a son of [[Emma of Hauteville]] and [[Odo the Good Marquis]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Robert Guiscard]] and Guiscard's first wife [[Alberada of Buonalbergo]]. Emma was also a sister of [[Bohemond I of Antioch]].\n\n===First Crusade===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nIn 1096, Tancred joined his maternal uncle Bohemond on the [[First Crusade]], and the two made their way to [[Constantinople]]. There, he was pressured to swear an oath to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]], promising to give back any conquered land to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Although the other leaders did not intend to keep their oaths, Tancred refused to swear the oath altogether. He participated in the [[siege of Nicaea]] in 1097, but the city was taken by Alexius' army after secret negotiations with the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Because of this, Tancred was very distrustful of the Byzantines. \n\nIn 1097 the Crusaders divided their forces at [[Heraclea Cybistra]] and Tancred entered the Levant by passing south through the [[Cilician Gates]].<ref name=\"tomaschek\">{{cite book|last1=Tomaschek |first1=W.| title=Zur historischen Topographie von Kleinasien im Mittelalter| date=1891|publisher=Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften| location=Vienna|page=86}}</ref> He displayed the skills of a brilliant tactician by seizing five of the most important sites in Cilicia Pedias, which included the ancient cities of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] and [[Adana]], the great emporium at [[Mopsuestia]], and the strategic castles at [[Sarvandikar]] and [[Anazarbus]].<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII | date=1987 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=67, 69-70, 199-200, 216}}</ref> The last three settlements were annexed to the Principality of Antioch. During their fourteen-year occupation of Anazarbus the Crusaders built the magnificent donjon atop the center of the fortified outcrop. At Sarvandikar, which controlled the strategic Amanus Pass, Tancred imprisoned [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Saint-Gilles]] in 1101/02.<ref>Matthew of Edessa, ''Recueil des historiens des croisades, Documents arm\u00e9niens'', vol. 1, reprint: Farnborough, 1967, p. 57.</ref> \n\nHe assisted in the [[siege of Antioch]] in 1098. One year later, during the assault on [[Jerusalem]], Tancred, along with [[Gaston IV of B\u00e9arn]], claimed to have been the first [[Crusade]]r to enter the city on July 15. However, the first crusader to enter Jerusalem was Ludolf of Tournai, and he was followed by his brother Englebert. When the city fell, Tancred gave his banner to a group of the citizens who had fled to the roof of the [[Temple of Solomon]]. This should have assured their safety, but they were massacred, along with many others, during the sack of the city. The author of the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' (Deeds of the Franks) records that, when Tancred realised this, he was \"greatly angered\". When the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] was established, Tancred became Prince of Galilee.\n\n===Regent of Antioch===\n[[File:Tancr\u00e8de de Hauteville.jpg||thumb|150px|right]]\nIn 1100, Tancred became regent of Antioch when Bohemond was taken prisoner by the [[Danishmends]] at the [[Battle of Melitene]]. He expanded the territory of the Latin principality by capturing land from the Byzantines, although, over the next decade, Alexius attempted, unsuccessfully, to bring him under Byzantine control.  In 1104, he also took control of the [[County of Edessa]] when [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] was taken captive after the [[Battle of Harran]]. After Baldwin's release in late 1108, he had to fight Tancred (probably early 1109) to regain control of the county; Tancred was eventually defeated and returned to Antioch. After Harran, Bohemond returned to Europe to recruit more Crusaders, again leaving his nephew as regent in [[Antioch]]. Tancred's victory over [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan of Aleppo]] at the [[Battle of Artah]] in 1105 allowed the Latin principality to recover some its territories east of the [[Orontes River]].<ref>Smail, p. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1108, Tancred refused to honour the [[Treaty of Devol]], in which Bohemond swore an oath of fealty to Alexius, and for decades afterwards Antioch remained independent of the Byzantine Empire.  In 1110, he brought [[Krak des Chevaliers]] under his control, which would later become an important castle in the [[County of Tripoli]]. Tancred remained regent in Antioch in the name of [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond II]] until his death in 1112 during a [[typhoid]] epidemic. He had married [[Cecile of France]], but died childless.\n\nThe ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]'' is a biography of Tancred written in [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Ralph of Caen]], a Norman who joined the First Crusade and served under Tancred and Bohemond. An English translation was co-published in 2005 by Bernard S. Bachrach and David S. Bachrach.\n\n[[Image:Tancred and Erminia.JPG|thumb|350px|right|[[Nicolas Poussin]]'s ''Tancred and Erminia'' ([[Hermitage Museum]])]]\n\n==In fiction==\nTancred appears as a character in [[Torquato Tasso]]'s 16th-century poem ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', in which he is portrayed as an epic hero and given a fictional love interest, the pagan warrior-maiden Clorinda. He is also loved by the Princess [[Erminia]] of Antioch. Portions of Tasso's verses were set by [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in his 1624 dramatic work ''[[Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]''. He also appears in one of the scenes in [[Imre Mad\u00e1ch]]'s ''[[Az ember trag\u00e9di\u00e1ja|The Tragedy of Man]]''. In [[Edwin Thomas (novelist)|Tom Harper]]'s ''Siege of Heaven'' he is depicted as a violent psychopath. His portrayal is similar although slightly more humorous in [[Alfred Duggan]]'s novel ''Count Bohemond''.\n\nTancred also appears as one of the Crusade leaders in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'' who returned to [[Constantinople]] from [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] to ensure a fair contest between Count Robert and his challenger. The novel ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred, or the New Crusade]]'' by [[Benjamin Disraeli]] centres around the adventures of an imagined modern descendant and namesake of the Prince of Galilee. Rossini's opera ''[[Tancredi]]'' is based on Tasso, via [[Voltaire]]'s play ''Tancr\u00e8de'' of 1759.\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Edwards, Robert W., ''The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII'', Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University (1987). {{ISBN|0-88402-163-7}}\n*Robert Lawrence Nicholson, ''Tancred: A Study of His Career and Work''.

{"title_page": "Interval graph", "text_new": "[[Image:Interval graph.svg|thumb|300px|Seven intervals on the real line and the corresponding seven-vertex interval graph.]]\nIn [[graph theory]], an '''interval graph''' is an [[undirected graph]] formed from a set of [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] on the [[real line]],\nwith a vertex for each interval and an edge between vertices whose intervals intersect. It is the [[intersection graph]] of the intervals.\n\nInterval graphs are [[chordal graph]]s and [[perfect graph]]s. They can be recognized in [[linear time]], and an optimal [[graph coloring]] or [[maximum clique]] in these graphs can be found in linear time. The interval graphs include all [[proper interval graph]]s, graphs defined in the same way from a set of [[unit interval]]s.\n\nThese graphs have been used to model [[food web]]s, and to study [[scheduling]] problems in which one must select a subset of tasks to be performed at non-overlapping times.\nOther applications include assembling contiguous subsequences in [[DNA]] mapping, and temporal reasoning.\n\n==Definition==\nAn interval graph is an undirected graph ''G'' formed from a family of intervals\n:''S''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;... \nby creating one vertex ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> for each interval ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>, and connecting two vertices ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''v''<sub>''j''</sub> by an edge whenever the corresponding two sets have a nonempty intersection, that is, the edge set of ''G'' is\n:''E''(''G'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;<nowiki>{{</nowiki>''v''<sub>''i''</sub>,&nbsp;''v''<sub>j</sub>}&nbsp;|&nbsp;''S''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''S''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;\u2205}.\n\n== Characterizations ==\n\nThree vertices form an ''asteroidal triple (AT)'' in a graph if, for each two, there exists a path containing those two but no neighbor of the third. A graph is AT-free if it has no asteroidal triple. The earliest characterization of interval graphs seems to be the following:\n\n* A graph is an interval graph if and only if it is [[chordal]] and AT-free.<ref name=\"Lekkerkerker 1962\">{{harvtxt|Lekkerkerker|Boland|1962}}</ref>\n\nOther characterizations:\n\n* A graph is an interval graph if and only if its maximal [[Clique (graph theory)|cliques]] can be ordered ''M''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''M''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''M''<sub>''k''</sub> such that for any ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''M''<sub>''k''</sub>, where ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''k'', it is also the case that ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M''<sub>''j''</sub> for any ''M''<sub>''j''</sub>, ''i''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''k''.<ref name=\"Fishburn\">{{harv|Fishburn|1985}}</ref>\n\n* A graph is an interval graph if and only if the edge clique cover of all of its maximal cliques can be arranged into a clique path representation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fulkerson|Gross|1965}}</ref>\n\n* A graph is an interval graph if and only if it does not contain [[Cycle graph|''C''<sub>4</sub>]] as an [[induced subgraph]] and its complement has a transitive orientation.<ref name=\"Gilmore 1964\">{{harvtxt|Gilmore|Hoffman|1964}}</ref>\n\nVarious other characterizations of interval graphs and variants have been described.<ref>{{harvtxt|McKee|McMorris|1999}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Brandst\u00e4dt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}</ref>\n\n== Efficient recognition algorithm ==\n\nDetermining whether a given graph ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(V,&nbsp;E) is an interval graph can be done in ''O''(|''V''|+|''E''|) time by seeking an ordering of the maximal [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]]s of ''G'' that is consecutive with respect to vertex inclusion. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe original linear time recognition algorithm of {{harvtxt|Booth|Lueker|1976}} is based on their complex [[PQ tree]] data structure, but {{harvtxt|Habib|McConnell|Paul|Viennot|2000}} showed how to solve the problem more simply using [[lexicographic breadth-first search]], based on the fact that a graph is an interval graph if and only if it is [[Chordal graph|chordal]] and its [[complement (graph theory)|complement]] is a [[comparability graph]].<ref name=\"Fishburn\"/><ref name=\"Golumbic\" >{{harvtxt|Golumbic|1980}}.</ref>\nA similar approach using a 6-sweep LexBFS algorithm is described in {{harvtxt|Corneil|Olariu|Stewart|2009}}.\n\n==Related families of graphs==\n\nBy the characterization of interval graphs as AT-free chordal graphs,<ref name=\"Lekkerkerker 1962\"/> interval graphs are [[strongly chordal graph]]s and hence [[perfect graph]]s.\nTheir [[complement graph|complements]] belong to the class of [[comparability graph]]s,<ref name=\"Gilmore 1964\"/> and the comparability relations are precisely the [[interval order]]s.<ref name=\"Fishburn\"/>\n\nBased on the fact that a graph is an interval graph if and only if it is [[Chordal graph|chordal]] and its [[complement (graph theory)|complement]] is a [[comparability graph]], we have: \nA graph and its complement are interval graphs if and only if it is both a [[split graph]] and a [[permutation graph]].\n\nThe interval graphs that have an interval representation in which every two intervals are either disjoint or nested are the [[trivially perfect graph]]s.\n\nA graph has [[boxicity]] at most one if and only if it is an interval graph; the boxicity of an arbitrary graph ''G'' is the minimum number of interval graphs on the same set of vertices such that the intersection of the edges sets of the interval graphs is ''G''.\n\nThe intersection graphs of [[arc (geometry)|arc]]s of a [[circle]] form [[circular-arc graph]]s, a class of graphs that contains the interval graphs. The [[trapezoid graph]]s, intersections of trapezoids whose parallel sides all lie on the same two parallel lines, are also a generalization of the interval graphs.\n\nThe connected [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] interval graphs are exactly the [[caterpillar tree]]s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eckhoff|1993}}.</ref>\n\n=== Proper Interval Graphs ===\n[[Proper interval graph]]s are interval graphs that have an interval representation in which no interval [[Subset|properly contains]] any other interval; [[unit interval graph]]s are the interval graphs that have an interval representation in which each interval has unit length. A unit interval representation without repeated intervals is necessarily a proper interval representation. Not every proper interval representation is a unit interval representation, but every proper interval graph is a unit interval graph, and vice versa.<ref>{{harvtxt|Roberts|1969}}; {{harvtxt|Gardi|2007}}</ref> Every proper interval graph is a [[claw-free graph]]; conversely, the proper interval graphs are exactly the claw-free interval graphs.

This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]]. Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Sarala Devi lived in [[Varanasi]] from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines. She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from [[Swami Saradananda]]. Assuming the leadership of the Sri Sarada Math, Bharatiprana served from December 1954 to January 1973, till her Mahasamadhi.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.232</ref>\nHer pious life was written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''Bharatiprana Smriti Katha'' and later translated in [[English language|English]] by Pravrajika Atmaprana as Pravrajika Bharatiprana.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.233</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Mokshaprana ===\n[[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]] (1915-1999) was the second President.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mokshaprana.php</ref> She also served as the headmistress of Sister Nivedita's Girls' School from 1946 to 1948.<ref>Mokshaprana, Pravrajika. \"Sri Sarada Society Notes Fall 1999, Volume 5, Issue 2\" (PDF).

The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

The family was owner of Dhaka Nawab estate, and were seated at [[Ahsan Manzil]] palace. Nawab of Dhaka was the title of the head of family and estate. [[Khwaja Alimullah]] was the first Nawab of Dhaka instated by the British Raj.\n\nConsiderable infighting within the Nawab's family lead to the decline of the estate. In 1952 the East Pakistan Estates Acquisition Act formally abolished the estate. [[Khwaja Habibullah]] Khan Bahadur was the last reigning Nawab of Dhaka. Successive land reform  in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] brought an end to the remaining landholdings of the Nawab family.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nawab's Dilkusha Garden, Dhaka (1904).jpg|thumb|240px|Nawab's Dilkusha Garden, Dhaka (1904) by Fritz Kapp.]]\nDhaka Nawab family was founded by Maulvi Khwaja Hafizullah Kashmiri,  who acquired considerable wealth from trading in leather and gold.

He learnt English and encouraged members of his family to learn English, and forged ties of friendship with Englishmen by mixing with them freely.

Nawab Abdul Ghani made several contributions towards benevolent and charitable work, not only in the city and elsewhere in Bengal but also beyond the Indian subcontinent. His most conspicuous public act was the water works system in Dhaka city. The filtered water was supplied free of charge to the people of Dhaka. In addition he established a number of schools, madrasas and donated funds for the Mitford hospital in Dhaka, Kolkata Medical College and Aligarh College.

Nawab Salimullah was a great educational reformer, and like his father, was inclined to prodigal liberality. He was a great philanthropist, rendering financial assistance to many poor students, and established the largest orphanage of undivided Bengal, which was named \"Salimullah Muslim Orphanage\". For the benefit of Muslim students he donated the well-known \"Salimullah Muslim Hall\"  in Dhaka, which was then the largest residential Hall in any Asian University.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nNawab Sir Salimuilah is mainly remembered today for three of his greatest achievements. Firstly, the part he played in the partition of Bengal which was implemented on 16 October 1905, aimed at freeing the Bengali Muslims from the bondage of Hindu domination, and to secure their socio-economic progress by establishing a separate Muslim majority province; secondly, for being the founder of such a strong political party as the All India Muslim League in December 1906, and the establishment of Dhaka University in 1912.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs has so often happened in the great families of India, after five generations of splendour, the Nawab Family now entered on a period of decline.

He is reported to have said that, his grandfather, Nawab Sir Abdul Ghani, and his father, Nawab Sir Khwaja .Ahsanullah,  were men of international renown and were  imbibed with the love of their country and people, but, they refrained from participating in politics. It was in his destiny to open the door to politics for the Nawab Family of Dhaka.

Only the Ahsan Manzil complex and khas lands held under raiyati rights were exempted from the operation of the Acquisition Act.

The anti-Khwaja faction of the Muslim League broke away from the All Bengal Muslim Students League, and established East Pakistan Muslim Students League in 1948.

Dhaka Nawab Family, together with the [[Ispahani family|Ispahanis]] of [[Kolkata]] still kept a firm grip on a majority of Muslim students while the Bengal chapter of the All India Muslim Students Association was renamed as All Bengal Muslim Students League in 1938.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Salimullah,_Khwaja|title=Salimullah, Khwaja - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Nawab_Family_of_Dhaka|title=Nawab Family of Dhaka - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe tottering Dhaka Nawab Estate was brought under the [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]] in September 1907. The first steward of the Estate was HCF Meyer who was followed by LG Pillen, PJ Griffith, and PD Martin, all members of the [[Indian civil service]].<ref name=\":0\" /> On 16 December 1901, while he was posted in Mymensingh, he received a telegram informing him of the death of his father, and on his arrival in Dhaka the next morning, as the eldest son, and with the \"unanimous consent of all parties concerned\" was installed as the new Nawab. Nawab Salimullah was a great educational reformer, and like his father, was inclined to prodigal liberality. He was a great philanthropist, rendering financial assistance to many poor students, and established the largest orphanage of undivided Bengal, which was named \"Salimullah Muslim Orphanage\". For the benefit of Muslim students he donated the well-known \"Salimullah Muslim Hall\"  in Dhaka, which was then the largest residential Hall in any Asian University.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nNawab Sir Salimuilah is mainly remembered today for three of his greatest achievements. Firstly, the part he played in the partition of Bengal which was implemented on 16 October 1905, aimed at freeing the Bengali Muslims from the bondage of Hindu domination, and to secure their socio-economic progress by establishing a separate Muslim majority province; secondly, for being the founder of such a strong political party as the All India Muslim League in December 1906, and the establishment of Dhaka University in 1912.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs has so often happened in the great families of India, after five generations of splendour, the Nawab Family now entered on a period of decline. Extravagant living and the necessity of maintaining an ever-increasing number of dependents were the main causes of the trouble, but to them must be added, the considerable sums spent by Nawab Ahsanullah and Nawab Salimuilah on public service or pro-Partition propaganda. The family was heavily in debt and in view of the political importance of the family, its estates were brought under the Court of Wards in 1909.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNawab Salimullah was the first man of the Nawab Family of Dhaka to actively participate in politics. He is reported to have said that, his grandfather, Nawab Sir Abdul Ghani, and his father, Nawab Sir Khwaja .Ahsanullah,  were men of international renown and were  imbibed with the love of their country and people, but, they refrained from participating in politics. It was in his destiny to open the door to politics for the Nawab Family of Dhaka. Nawab Sir Salimullah died in Calcutta on 16 January 1915, and his coffin was brought to Dhaka by a special launch, and he was buried in the family graveyard in Begum Bazar.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 1934, the family had estates that covered almost 200,000 acres and was well spread over different districts of Eastern Bengal, together with properties in Shillong, Assam, had an yearly rent of \u20a4120,000. With its wealth, social status and close relationship with the Raj, the family of the Nawab of Dacca was the single most powerful Muslim family in Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chatterji |first=Joya |title=Bengal Divided: Hindu Communalism and Partition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=80}}</ref>\n\nThe Dhaka Nawab Estate was abolished in 1952 under the East Bengal Estate Acquisition and Tenancy Act (1950). Only the Ahsan Manzil complex and khas lands held under raiyati rights were exempted from the operation of the Acquisition Act. But due to many unresolved family claims many assets of the Estate were still controlled by the Court of Wards. The land reforms board, which is the successor of the Court of Wards, still holds those assets on behalf of the family.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe influence of Dhaka Nawab family on the Muslim Students League eroded after the partition, particularly after [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s pronouncement on the state language issue in 1948. The anti-Khwaja faction of the Muslim League broke away from the All Bengal Muslim Students League, and established East Pakistan Muslim Students League in 1948. This Students League spearheaded the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] that began that year.\n\n==Brief genealogy==\n<center>\n<div class=\"float\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;  width: 12em; background: #f9f9f9;  border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;  border-collapse: collapse;\"\n! !!
