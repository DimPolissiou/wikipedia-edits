In August 2004, a committee was formed to supervise the establishment of a [[stock market]]. Beyond the financial sector, the Syrian Government has enacted major changes to rental and tax laws, and is reportedly considering similar changes to the commercial code and to other laws, which impact property rights.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n(Ohachq)\nSyria has produced [[Heavy crude oil|heavy-grade oil]] from fields inside in the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|northeast]] since the late 1960s. In the early 1980s, [[light crude oil|light-grade]], [[sweet crude oil|low-sulphur oil]] was discovered near [[Deir ez-Zor]] in eastern Syria. This discovery relieved Syria of the need to import light oil to mix with domestic heavy crude in [[Oil refinery|refineries]]. Recently,{{when|date=January 2016}} Syrian oil production has been about 379,000 barrels per day (bpd).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Syria's [[oil reserve]]s are being gradually depleted and reached 2.5 billion barrels in January 2009.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Experts{{who|date=January 2016}} generally agree that Syria will become a net importer of [[petroleum]] by the end of the next decade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Recent developments have helped revitalize the energy sector, including new discoveries and the successful development of its hydrocarbon reserves. According to the 2009 Syria Report of the Oxford Business Group, the oil sector accounted for 23% of [[government revenue]]s, 20% of exports, and 22% of GDP in 2008. Syria exported roughly 150,000 bpd in 2008, and oil accounted for a majority of the country's export income.<ref name=USState2010/>\n\n[[Ad hoc]] economic [[liberalization]] continues to add wealth inequality, impoverishing the average population while enriching a few people in Syria's [[private sector]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1990, the government established an official [[parallel exchange rate]] to provide incentives for remittances and exports through official channels. This action improved the supply of basic commodities and contained inflation by removing risk premiums on smuggled commodities.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nForeign aid to Syria in 1997 totaled an estimated US$199 million. The [[World Bank]] reported that in July 2004 that it had committed a total of US$661 million for 20 operations in Syria.

With almost 60% of its population under the age of 20, [[unemployment]] higher than the current 9% is a real possibility unless sustained and strong economic growth takes off.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nCommerce has always been important to the Syrian economy<ref>http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/caimed/unpan018700.pdf</ref>, which benefited from the country's strategic location along major east-west [[trade route]]s. Syrian cities boast both traditional industries such as [[weaving]] and dried-fruit packing and modern [[heavy industry]]. Given the policies adopted from the 1960s through the late 1980s, Syria refused to join the \"[[economic globalization|global economy]]\". In late 2001, however, Syria submitted a request to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) to begin the accession process. Syria had been an original contracting party of the former [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] but withdrew in 1951 because of [[Israel]]'s joining. Major elements of current Syrian trade rules would have to change in order to be consistent with the WTO. In March 2007, Syria signed an [[Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union]] that would encourage both sides to negotiate a free trade agreement before 2010.\n\nThe bulk of Syrian [[International trade|import]]s have been raw materials essential for industry, agriculture, equipment, and machinery. Major exports include [[crude oil]], refined products, [[cotton|raw cotton]], [[clothing]], fruits, and [[cereal]] grains.\n\nOver time, the government has increased the number of transactions to which the more favorable neighboring country exchange rate applies. The government also introduced a quasi-rate for non-commercial transactions in 2001 broadly in line with prevailing [[black market]] rates.\n\nGiven the poor development of its own [[capital market]]s and Syria's lack of access to international money and capital markets, monetary policy remains captive to the need to cover the [[budget deficit|fiscal deficit]]. Although in 2003 Syria lowered [[interest rate]]s for the first time in 22 years and again in 2004, rates remain fixed by law.\n\n===Debt===\nUnder Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]], national debt in relation to GDP went from 152.09% 2000 down to 30.02% in 2010.<ref>[https://www.statista.com/statistics/326945/national-debt-of-syria-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp/ Syria: National debt from 2000 to 2010 in relation to gross domestic product (GDP)]. ''Statista''</ref> Syria has made progress in easing its heavy [[Government debt|foreign debt]] burden through bilateral rescheduling deals with virtually all of its key [[creditor]]s in [[Europe]]. In December 2004, Syria and Poland reached an agreement by which Syria would pay $27 million out of the total $261.7 million debt. In January 2005, [[Russia]] and Syria signed a deal that wrote off nearly 80% of Syria's debt to Russia, approximately \u20ac10.5 billion ($13 billion). The agreement left Syria with less than \u20ac3 billion (just over $3.6 billion) owed to Moscow. Half of it would be repaid over the next 10 years, while the rest would be paid into Russian accounts in Syrian banks and could be used for Russian investment projects in Syria and for buying Syrian products. This agreement was part of a weapons deal between Russia and Syria.

Most irrigated land is designated \"strategic\", meaning that it encounters significant state intervention in terms of pricing, subsidies, and marketing controls. \"Strategic\" products such as wheat, barley, and sugar beets, must be sold to state marketing boards at fixed prices, often above world prices in order to support farmers, but at a significant cost to the state budget. The most widely grown arable crop is wheat, but the most important cash crop is cotton; cotton was the largest single export before the development of the oil sector. Nevertheless, the total area planted with cotton has declined because of an increasing problem of water shortage coupled with old and inefficient irrigation techniques. The output of grains like wheat is often underutilized because of poor storage facilities.<ref name=cp9-10/>\n\nWater and energy are among the most pervasive issues facing the agriculture sector. Another difficulty suffered by the agricultural sector is the government's decision to liberalize prices of fertilizers, which have increased between 100% and 400%. Drought was an alarming problem in 2008; however, the drought situation slightly improved in 2009. Wheat and barley production about doubled in 2009 compared to 2008. In spite of that, the livelihoods of up to 1 million agricultural workers have been threatened. In response, the UN launched an emergency appeal for $20.2 million. Wheat has been one of the crops most affected, and for the first time in 2 decades Syria has moved from being a net exporter of wheat to a net importer.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm#econ Syria].

In August 2004, a committee was formed to supervise the establishment of a [[stock market]]. Beyond the financial sector, the Syrian Government has enacted major changes to rental and tax laws, and is reportedly considering similar changes to the commercial code and to other laws, which impact property rights.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n(Ohachq)\nSyria has produced [[Heavy crude oil|heavy-grade oil]] from fields inside in the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|northeast]] since the late 1960s. In the early 1980s, [[light crude oil|light-grade]], [[sweet crude oil|low-sulphur oil]] was discovered near [[Deir ez-Zor]] in eastern Syria. This discovery relieved Syria of the need to import light oil to mix with domestic heavy crude in [[Oil refinery|refineries]]. Recently,{{when|date=January 2016}} Syrian oil production has been about 379,000 barrels per day (bpd).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Syria's [[oil reserve]]s are being gradually depleted and reached 2.5 billion barrels in January 2009.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Experts{{who|date=January 2016}} generally agree that Syria will become a net importer of [[petroleum]] by the end of the next decade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Recent developments have helped revitalize the energy sector, including new discoveries and the successful development of its hydrocarbon reserves. According to the 2009 Syria Report of the Oxford Business Group, the oil sector accounted for 23% of [[government revenue]]s, 20% of exports, and 22% of GDP in 2008. Syria exported roughly 150,000 bpd in 2008, and oil accounted for a majority of the country's export income.<ref name=USState2010/>\n\n[[Ad hoc]] economic [[liberalization]] continues to add wealth inequality, impoverishing the average population while enriching a few people in Syria's [[private sector]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1990, the government established an official [[parallel exchange rate]] to provide incentives for remittances and exports through official channels. This action improved the supply of basic commodities and contained inflation by removing risk premiums on smuggled commodities.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nForeign aid to Syria in 1997 totaled an estimated US$199 million. The [[World Bank]] reported that in July 2004 that it had committed a total of US$661 million for 20 operations in Syria.

With almost 60% of its population under the age of 20, [[unemployment]] higher than the current 9% is a real possibility unless sustained and strong economic growth takes off.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nCommerce has always been important to the Syrian economy<ref>http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/caimed/unpan018700.pdf</ref>, which benefited from the country's strategic location along major east-west [[trade route]]s. Syrian cities boast both traditional industries such as [[weaving]] and dried-fruit packing and modern [[heavy industry]]. Given the policies adopted from the 1960s through the late 1980s, Syria refused to join the \"[[economic globalization|global economy]]\". In late 2001, however, Syria submitted a request to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) to begin the accession process. Syria had been an original contracting party of the former [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] but withdrew in 1951 because of [[Israel]]'s joining. Major elements of current Syrian trade rules would have to change in order to be consistent with the WTO. In March 2007, Syria signed an [[Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union]] that would encourage both sides to negotiate a free trade agreement before 2010.\n\nThe bulk of Syrian [[International trade|import]]s have been raw materials essential for industry, agriculture, equipment, and machinery. Major exports include [[crude oil]], refined products, [[cotton|raw cotton]], [[clothing]], fruits, and [[cereal]] grains.\n\nOver time, the government has increased the number of transactions to which the more favorable neighboring country exchange rate applies. The government also introduced a quasi-rate for non-commercial transactions in 2001 broadly in line with prevailing [[black market]] rates.\n\nGiven the poor development of its own [[capital market]]s and Syria's lack of access to international money and capital markets, monetary policy remains captive to the need to cover the [[budget deficit|fiscal deficit]]. Although in 2003 Syria lowered [[interest rate]]s for the first time in 22 years and again in 2004, rates remain fixed by law.\n\n===Debt===\nUnder Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]], national debt in relation to GDP went from 152.09% 2000 down to 30.02% in 2010.<ref>[https://www.statista.com/statistics/326945/national-debt-of-syria-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp/ Syria: National debt from 2000 to 2010 in relation to gross domestic product (GDP)]. ''Statista''</ref> Syria has made progress in easing its heavy [[Government debt|foreign debt]] burden through bilateral rescheduling deals with virtually all of its key [[creditor]]s in [[Europe]]. In December 2004, Syria and Poland reached an agreement by which Syria would pay $27 million out of the total $261.7 million debt. In January 2005, [[Russia]] and Syria signed a deal that wrote off nearly 80% of Syria's debt to Russia, approximately \u20ac10.5 billion ($13 billion). The agreement left Syria with less than \u20ac3 billion (just over $3.6 billion) owed to Moscow. Half of it would be repaid over the next 10 years, while the rest would be paid into Russian accounts in Syrian banks and could be used for Russian investment projects in Syria and for buying Syrian products. This agreement was part of a weapons deal between Russia and Syria. And later that year Syria reached an agreement with [[Slovakia]], and the [[Czech Republic]] to settle debt estimated at $1.6 billion. Again Syria was forgiven the bulk of its debt, in exchange for a one time payment of $150 million.\n\n==Sectors of the economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Syria}}\n[[File:Olive groves in Syria.jpg|thumb|right|Olive groves in Western-Syria, [[Homs Governorate]].]]\nAgriculture is a high priority in Syria's economic development plans, as the government seeks to achieve food self-sufficiency, increase export earnings, and halt rural out-migration.<ref name=cp9-10>{{cite news|title=Country Profile: Syria, April 2005|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf|newspaper=Library of Congress \u2013 Federal Research Division |pages=9\u201310}}</ref> Thanks to sustained [[Capital (economics)|capital investment]], infrastructure development, [[subsidy|subsidies]] of inputs, and price supports, Syria has gone from a net importer of many agricultural products to an exporter of cotton, fruits, [[vegetable]]s, and other foodstuffs.

Most irrigated land is designated \"strategic\", meaning that it encounters significant state intervention in terms of pricing, subsidies, and marketing controls. \"Strategic\" products such as wheat, barley, and sugar beets, must be sold to state marketing boards at fixed prices, often above world prices in order to support farmers, but at a significant cost to the state budget. The most widely grown arable crop is wheat, but the most important cash crop is cotton; cotton was the largest single export before the development of the oil sector. Nevertheless, the total area planted with cotton has declined because of an increasing problem of water shortage coupled with old and inefficient irrigation techniques. The output of grains like wheat is often underutilized because of poor storage facilities.<ref name=cp9-10/>\n\nWater and energy are among the most pervasive issues facing the agriculture sector. Another difficulty suffered by the agricultural sector is the government's decision to liberalize prices of fertilizers, which have increased between 100% and 400%. Drought was an alarming problem in 2008; however, the drought situation slightly improved in 2009. Wheat and barley production about doubled in 2009 compared to 2008. In spite of that, the livelihoods of up to 1 million agricultural workers have been threatened. In response, the UN launched an emergency appeal for $20.2 million. Wheat has been one of the crops most affected, and for the first time in 2 decades Syria has moved from being a net exporter of wheat to a net importer.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm#econ Syria].

Its dreamy, hypnotic feel is due in part to [[Lou Gramm]]'s soulful lead vocals and the New Jersey Mass Choir's background vocals.\"<ref name=\"Bret Adams\"/>\n\nThe song was also issued as a 12-inch single with a longer time length of 6:23. This version contains a slightly longer intro and an extended vocal chorus/fadeout ending. The single's [[B-side]] \"Street Thunder (Marathon Theme)\" is an instrumental track originally appearing on ''The Official Music of the XXIII Olympiad \u2013 Los Angeles 1984'' and later on the band's 2-CD compilation ''Jukebox Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology'' (2000).\n\nSoon after Foreigner's single topped the charts, the New Jersey Mass Choir released its own similar-sounding version of the song on an album that it also titled ''I Want to Know What Love Is.'' The choir's single peaked at number 37 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart and number 12 on the [[Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]] chart.\n\nThe Foreigner song was ranked by ''Billboard'' as the number four [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single of 1985.<ref name=\"BB_Hot100_YE\"/> It was the band's third [[Platinum single]] in the U.S.<ref>{{cite
