In the period after the [[Medieval Inquisition]], it was one of three different manifestations of the wider [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] along with the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]].\n\n==Objectives==\nLike other iterations of the Inquisition, the Roman Inquisition was responsible for [[prosecution|prosecuting]] individuals accused of committing offenses relating to [[heresy]], including [[Protestantism]], [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]], [[immorality]], [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well as for [[censorship]] of printed literature. After 1567, with the execution of [[Pietro Carnesecchi]], an allegedly leading heretic, the Holy Office moved to broaden concerns beyond that of theological matters, such as love magic, witchcraft, superstitions, and cultural morality. However, the treatment was more disciplinary than punitive.<ref name=\"Black, Christopher F 2009\">Black, Christopher F. 2009. The Italian Inquisition. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> \nThe tribunals of the Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of [[papal]] [[jurisdiction]] in other parts of [[Europe]], including [[Avignon]], a papal enclave within the territory of [[France]]. The Roman Inquisition, though, was considerably more [[bureaucratic]] and focused on pre-emptive control in addition to the reactive [[judicial]] prosecution experienced under other iterations.<ref name=bargrave>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LxUpAAAAYAAJ& ''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals''] by [[John Bargrave]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] (reprint; 2009)</ref>\n\n==Function==\nTypically, the [[pope]] appointed one [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] to preside over meetings of the Congregation. Though often referred to in historical literature as ''Grand Inquisitors'', the role was substantially different from the formally appointed [[Grand Inquisitor]] of the Spanish Inquisition. There were usually ten other cardinals who were members of the Congregation, as well as a [[prelate]] and two assistants all chosen from the [[Dominican Order]]. The Holy Office also had an international group of [[consultor|consultants]]; experienced scholars of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] who advised on specific questions. The congregation, in turn, presided over the activity of local tribunals.\n\n==History==\nThe Roman Inquisition began in 1542 as part of the Catholic Church's Counter-Reformation against the spread of Protestantism, but it represented a less harsh affair than the previously established Spanish Inquisition.<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/10145-sloppy-records-cast-galileo-trial-light.html Hsu, Jeremy. \"Sloppy Records Cast Galileo's Trial in New Light\", ''Live Science'', September 30, 2010]</ref> \nIn 1588,<ref>[http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/9178/Beaudet_cua_0043A_10069display.pdf] ''Dissertation C.

In 1908, the congregation was renamed the [[Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]] and in 1965 it was renamed again and is now known as the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].\n\nWhile the Roman Inquisition was originally designed to combat the spread of Protestantism in Italy, the institution outlived that original purpose and the system of tribunals lasted until the mid 18th century, when pre-[[Unification of Italy|unification]] Italian states began to suppress the local inquisitions, effectively eliminating the power of the church to prosecute heretical crimes.\n\n===Copernicus===\n{{main|Nicolaus Copernicus}}\nNicolaus Copernicus published a formulated model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe in his book [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]] (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), in 1543. The book was dedicated to [[Pope Paul III]], who was known for his interests in [[astronomy]].\n\nIn 1616, the Roman Inquisition's consultants judged the proposition that the [[sun]] is immobile and [[heliocentric|at the center of the universe]] and that the [[Earth]] moves around it, to be \"foolish and absurd in philosophy\" and that the first was \"formally heretical\" while the second was \"at least erroneous in faith\".

In-depth historical research regarding minor details of different types of magic, theological heresies, and political climate of The Reformation further revealed that Inquisitorial procedures greatly restrained witch hunting in Italy. Scholars specializing in the Renaissance and Early Modern period such as Guido Ruggiero, Christopher F. Black, and Mary O'Neil also discussed the importance of proper procedures and sparse use of torture. The low rate of torture and lawful interrogation, Black argued, means that trials tended to focus more on individual accusation, instead of groups. For the same reason, the notion of the Black Sabbath was much less accepted in contemporary Italian popular culture.<ref name=\"Black, Christopher F 2009\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Ruggiero |first=Guido |title=Binding Passions: Tales of Magic, Marriage and Power at the End of the Renaissance |location=Oxford, New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen |last=Haliczer |year=1986 |title=Inquisition and Society in Early Modern Europe |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm}}</ref> The Holy Office's function in the disenchantment of popular culture also helped advance rationalism by getting rid of superstitions. Jeffrey R. Watt refutes the feminist claim that the Inquisition was responsible for the death of so many women. Watt points out that in 1588 the Roman Curia stated it would only allow testimony about participation in a Sabbath by the practitioners themselves and not by outside witnesses.  Additionally, the Inquisition would eventually ban torture for the procurement of a witchcraft confession. {{When|date=May 2017}} The Holy Office also began seeking less harsh punishment for witches and viewed witches as those who had simply lost their way and who could be redeemed, not as apostates deserving death.{{When|date=May 2017}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watt|first1=Jeffrey|title=Review of The Italian Inquisition by Christopher F. Black|journal=The English Historical Review|date=2012|volume=524|page=164}}</ref>\n\nHistorians who leaned toward the witch-hunt-restraining argument were more inclined to differentiate different Inquisitions, and often drew contrast between Italy versus Central Europe. The number of executed witches is also greatly lowered, to between 45,000 and 60,000. Those who argued for the fault of the Inquisition in the witch-craze are more likely to contrast continental Europe to England, as well as seeing the Inquisitions as one singular event which lasted 600 years since its founding in the 11th or 12th century. The significance and emphasis of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' is seen more frequently in arguments which hold the Inquisition accountable for the witch-craze.\n\n==Later history==\n{{broader|Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|topic=later history and names}}\nThe {{according to whom|last notable action|date=December 2015}} of the Roman Inquisition occurred in 1858, in [[Bologna]], [[Papal States]], when Inquisition agents legally removed a 6-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], from his family.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kertzer |first=David I. |authorlink= |title=The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara  |year=1997 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=0-679-45031-9 }}</ref> The local inquisitor had learned that the boy had been secretly baptized by his nursemaid when he was in danger of death.  It was illegal for a Catholic child in the Papal States to be raised by Jews. Pope [[Pius IX]] raised the boy as a Catholic in Rome and he went on to become a priest.  The boy's father, Momolo Mortara, spent years seeking help in all quarters, including internationally, to try to reclaim his son.  These efforts availed him none at all. The case received international attention and fueled the anti-papal sentiments that helped the [[Italian nationalism]] movement and culminated in the 1870 [[Capture of Rome]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = The End of the Inquisition | series = Secret Files of the Inquisition | credits = David Rabinovitch, producer, director| network = PBS | airdate = May 2007}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Medieval Inquisition]]\n*[[Counter-Reformation]]\n*[[Pomponio Algerio]], attracted attention of the Inquisition and finally executed by civil authorities\n*[[S\u00e9bastien Bourdon]] (1616\u20131671), a French Protestant painter forced to flee Italy\n*[[Diego de Enzinas]], Protestant burnt to the stake in 1547\n*[[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] (1597\u20131679), secretary of the Inquisition 1633-79\n*[[Pietro Ottoboni]] (1667\u20131740), secretary of the Inquisition 1726-40\n*[[Tommaso Crudeli]], [[freemason]] imprisoned by the Inquisition\n*[[Cornelio Da Montalcino]], (a Franciscan friar who had embraced Judaism, and was burned alive on the [[Campo de' Fiori|Campo dei Fiori]])\n*[[Madonna Oriente]] case in 1390\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== Short bibliography ==\n* Christopher Black, ''The Italian Inquisition'', Yale University Press, New Haven\u2013London 2009\n* Andrea Del Col, ''L'Inquisizione in Italia.

In the period after the [[Medieval Inquisition]], it was one of three different manifestations of the wider [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] along with the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]].\n\n==Objectives==\nLike other iterations of the Inquisition, the Roman Inquisition was responsible for [[prosecution|prosecuting]] individuals accused of committing offenses relating to [[heresy]], including [[Protestantism]], [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]], [[immorality]], [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well as for [[censorship]] of printed literature. After 1567, with the execution of [[Pietro Carnesecchi]], an allegedly leading heretic, the Holy Office moved to broaden concerns beyond that of theological matters, such as love magic, witchcraft, superstitions, and cultural morality. However, the treatment was more disciplinary than punitive.<ref name=\"Black, Christopher F 2009\">Black, Christopher F. 2009. The Italian Inquisition. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> \nThe tribunals of the Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of [[papal]] [[jurisdiction]] in other parts of [[Europe]], including [[Avignon]], a papal enclave within the territory of [[France]]. The Roman Inquisition, though, was considerably more [[bureaucratic]] and focused on pre-emptive control in addition to the reactive [[judicial]] prosecution experienced under other iterations.<ref name=bargrave>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LxUpAAAAYAAJ& ''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals''] by [[John Bargrave]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] (reprint; 2009)</ref>\n\n==Function==\nTypically, the [[pope]] appointed one [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] to preside over meetings of the Congregation. Though often referred to in historical literature as ''Grand Inquisitors'', the role was substantially different from the formally appointed [[Grand Inquisitor]] of the Spanish Inquisition. There were usually ten other cardinals who were members of the Congregation, as well as a [[prelate]] and two assistants all chosen from the [[Dominican Order]]. The Holy Office also had an international group of [[consultor|consultants]]; experienced scholars of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] who advised on specific questions. The congregation, in turn, presided over the activity of local tribunals.\n\n==History==\nThe Roman Inquisition began in 1542 as part of the Catholic Church's Counter-Reformation against the spread of Protestantism, but it represented a less harsh affair than the previously established Spanish Inquisition.<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/10145-sloppy-records-cast-galileo-trial-light.html Hsu, Jeremy. \"Sloppy Records Cast Galileo's Trial in New Light\", ''Live Science'', September 30, 2010]</ref> \nIn 1588,<ref>[http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/9178/Beaudet_cua_0043A_10069display.pdf] ''Dissertation C.

In 1908, the congregation was renamed the [[Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]] and in 1965 it was renamed again and is now known as the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].\n\nWhile the Roman Inquisition was originally designed to combat the spread of Protestantism in Italy, the institution outlived that original purpose and the system of tribunals lasted until the mid 18th century, when pre-[[Unification of Italy|unification]] Italian states began to suppress the local inquisitions, effectively eliminating the power of the church to prosecute heretical crimes.\n\n===Copernicus===\n{{main|Nicolaus Copernicus}}\nNicolaus Copernicus published a formulated model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe in his book [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]] (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), in 1543. The book was dedicated to [[Pope Paul III]], who was known for his interests in [[astronomy]].\n\nIn 1616, the Roman Inquisition's consultants judged the proposition that the [[sun]] is immobile and [[heliocentric|at the center of the universe]] and that the [[Earth]] moves around it, to be \"foolish and absurd in philosophy\" and that the first was \"formally heretical\" while the second was \"at least erroneous in faith\".

In-depth historical research regarding minor details of different types of magic, theological heresies, and political climate of The Reformation further revealed that Inquisitorial procedures greatly restrained witch hunting in Italy. Scholars specializing in the Renaissance and Early Modern period such as Guido Ruggiero, Christopher F. Black, and Mary O'Neil also discussed the importance of proper procedures and sparse use of torture. The low rate of torture and lawful interrogation, Black argued, means that trials tended to focus more on individual accusation, instead of groups. For the same reason, the notion of the Black Sabbath was much less accepted in contemporary Italian popular culture.<ref name=\"Black, Christopher F 2009\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Ruggiero |first=Guido |title=Binding Passions: Tales of Magic, Marriage and Power at the End of the Renaissance |location=Oxford, New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen |last=Haliczer |year=1986 |title=Inquisition and Society in Early Modern Europe |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm}}</ref> The Holy Office's function in the disenchantment of popular culture also helped advance rationalism by getting rid of superstitions. Jeffrey R. Watt refutes the feminist claim that the Inquisition was responsible for the death of so many women. Watt points out that in 1588 the Roman Curia stated it would only allow testimony about participation in a Sabbath by the practitioners themselves and not by outside witnesses.  Additionally, the Inquisition would eventually ban torture for the procurement of a witchcraft confession. {{When|date=May 2017}} The Holy Office also began seeking less harsh punishment for witches and viewed witches as those who had simply lost their way and who could be redeemed, not as apostates deserving death.{{When|date=May 2017}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watt|first1=Jeffrey|title=Review of The Italian Inquisition by Christopher F. Black|journal=The English Historical Review|date=2012|volume=524|page=164}}</ref>\n\nHistorians who leaned toward the witch-hunt-restraining argument were more inclined to differentiate different Inquisitions, and often drew contrast between Italy versus Central Europe. The number of executed witches is also greatly lowered, to between 45,000 and 60,000. Those who argued for the fault of the Inquisition in the witch-craze are more likely to contrast continental Europe to England, as well as seeing the Inquisitions as one singular event which lasted 600 years since its founding in the 11th or 12th century. The significance and emphasis of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' is seen more frequently in arguments which hold the Inquisition accountable for the witch-craze.\n\n==Later history==\n{{broader|Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|later history and names}}\nThe {{according to whom|last notable action|date=December 2015}} of the Roman Inquisition occurred in 1858, in [[Bologna]], [[Papal States]], when Inquisition agents legally removed a 6-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], from his family.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kertzer |first=David I. |authorlink= |title=The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara  |year=1997 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=0-679-45031-9 }}</ref> The local inquisitor had learned that the boy had been secretly baptized by his nursemaid when he was in danger of death.  It was illegal for a Catholic child in the Papal States to be raised by Jews. Pope [[Pius IX]] raised the boy as a Catholic in Rome and he went on to become a priest.  The boy's father, Momolo Mortara, spent years seeking help in all quarters, including internationally, to try to reclaim his son.  These efforts availed him none at all. The case received international attention and fueled the anti-papal sentiments that helped the [[Italian nationalism]] movement and culminated in the 1870 [[Capture of Rome]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = The End of the Inquisition | series = Secret Files of the Inquisition | credits = David Rabinovitch, producer, director| network = PBS | airdate = May 2007}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Medieval Inquisition]]\n*[[Counter-Reformation]]\n*[[Pomponio Algerio]], attracted attention of the Inquisition and finally executed by civil authorities\n*[[S\u00e9bastien Bourdon]] (1616\u20131671), a French Protestant painter forced to flee Italy\n*[[Diego de Enzinas]], Protestant burnt to the stake in 1547\n*[[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] (1597\u20131679), secretary of the Inquisition 1633-79\n*[[Pietro Ottoboni]] (1667\u20131740), secretary of the Inquisition 1726-40\n*[[Tommaso Crudeli]], [[freemason]] imprisoned by the Inquisition\n*[[Cornelio Da Montalcino]], (a Franciscan friar who had embraced Judaism, and was burned alive on the [[Campo de' Fiori|Campo dei Fiori]])\n*[[Madonna Oriente]] case in 1390\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== Short bibliography ==\n* Christopher Black, ''The Italian Inquisition'', Yale University Press, New Haven\u2013London 2009\n* Andrea Del Col, ''L'Inquisizione in Italia.

By one definition, a coronet differs from a crown in that a coronet never has arches, and from a [[tiara]] in that a coronet completely encircles the head, while a tiara does not.  By a slightly different definition, a crown is worn by an emperor, empress, king or queen; a coronet by a [[nobleman]] or lady. See also [[diadem]].\n\nIn other languages, this distinction is not made as usually the same word for ''crown'' is used irrespective of rank (Krone in German, kroon in Dutch, krona in Swedish, couronne in French, etc.)\n\nThe main use is now actually not on the head (indeed, many people entitled to a coronet never have one made; the same even applies to some monarchs' crowns, as in Belgium) but as a [[rank symbol]] in [[heraldry]], adorning a [[coat of arms]].\n{{Heraldic achievement}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word stems from the Old French ''coronete'', a diminutive of ''co(u)ronne'' (\"crown\"), itself from the Latin ''corona'' (also \"wreath\"), from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7 (kor\u014dn\u0113, \"garland, wreath\").\n\nTraditionally, such headgear is \u2013 as indicated by the German equivalent ''Adelskrone'' (literally \"crown of nobility\") \u2013 used by [[Nobility|noble]]s and by princes and princesses in their [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]], rather than by [[monarch]]s, for whom the word ''crown'' is customarily reserved in formal English, while many languages have no such terminological distinction. Other than a crown, a coronet shows the rank of the respective noble. Hence, in [[German language|German]] and [[Scandinavia]]n languages there is also the term ''Rangkrone''.\n\nFor equivalents, both physical and emblematic, in other languages and cultures, see under [[crown (headgear)]].\n\n==Commonwealth usage==\n[[File:St Mary Magdalene, Croome, Worcs - Memorial to 4th Baron Coventry (1654\u20131687) coronet.JPG|thumb|Depiction of a baron's coronet on a 17th-century funerary monument]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a [[Peerage|peer]] wears his or her coronet on one occasion only: for a [[Coronation of the British monarch|royal coronation]], when it is worn along with [[Robes of the British peerage|coronation robes]], equally standardised as a luxurious uniform.\n\nIn the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerages of the United Kingdom]]<!-- please do not link to \"Peerage of the United Kingdom\"; that only refers to the titles created in the last 200 years -->, the design of a coronet shows the rank of its owner, as in German, French and various other heraldic traditions.  Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were [[engraving|engraved]] while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.<ref name=\"cox\">Cox, Noel (1999).

No. 22, pp. 8\u201313. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref>\n\n*The coronet of a [[Dukes in the United Kingdom|duke]] (a silver-gilt circlet, [[Repouss\u00e9 and chasing|chased]] as jewelled but not actually gemmed) has eight [[strawberry]] leaves of which five are seen in two-dimensional representations.\n*The coronet of a [[marquess]] has four strawberry leaves and four silver balls (known as \"pearls\", but not actually [[pearl]]s), slightly raised on points above the rim, of which three leaves and two balls are seen.\n*The coronet of an [[earl]] has eight strawberry leaves (four visible) and eight \"pearls\" raised on stalks, of which five are visible.\n*The coronet of a [[viscount]] has sixteen \"pearls\" touching one another, nine being seen in representation.\n*The coronet of a [[baron]] or [[Lord of Parliament]] in the Scots peerage (a plain silver-gilt circlet) has six \"pearls\" of which four are visible.\n\nSince a person entitled to wear a coronet customarily displays it in his or her [[coat of arms]] above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and below the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], this can provide a useful clue as to the owner of a given coat of arms. In [[Canadian heraldry#United Empire Loyalists|Canadian heraldry]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalists]] are entitled to use a Loyalist military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others) in their arms.\n\n===Royal usage===\n[[File:Crown of the British Heir Apparent.svg|right|thumb|The crown of the [[Prince of Wales|British Heir Apparent]]]]\nMembers of the [[British Royal Family]] often have coronets on their coats of arms, and may wear actual coronets at coronations (e.g., Princesses [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] at the 1937 coronation of their father as [[George VI]]). They were made, according to regulations made by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1661, shortly after his return from exile in France (getting a taste for its lavish court style; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] started monumental work at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] that year) during [[the Restoration]]. They vary depending upon the prince's relationship to the monarch. Occasionally, additional royal warrants vary the designs for individuals.

Some distinguished families held no higher title than count or even baron, but were proud of their ancient origin. Moreover, most of the nobility was legally untitled, some hereditary titles could be acquired by a nobleman who purchased a \"titled\" [[fief]], while ''[[courtesy title|titres de courtoisie]]'' were freely assumed in the absence of strict regulation by the French crown and became more numerous than titles legally borne. As an example, the title of ''marquis'' ranks in principle immediately after ''duke'', but was so ridiculed by the late 18th century (cf. the phrase \"petit marquis\" meaning a presumptuous and vain person) that Napoleon omitted it from his own scale of titles. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people assumed and used freely coronets of ranks that they did not have; and, in the 19th and 20th centuries abuse was still made of \"courtesy titles\".

In the 17th and 18th centuries they used a coronet of fleurs-de-lis like the enfants de France.

Some of the senior comital houses used coronets showing five leaves and four pearls (some mediatized counties and minor principalities had other types of coronets that distinguished them from regular counts).\n*''Freiherrnkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Freiherr]]'' (baron) shows seven visible tines with pearls.\n*''Adelskrone'': the coronet of ''[[German nobility|Adel]]'' members (untitled nobility) displays five visible tines with pearls. Sometimes, the central and outer tines are leaves and the other tines are headed by pearls. In the southern states of [[Bavaria]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], usually all tines are headed by pearls.\n<gallery>\nFile:T09 Herzog.svg|''Herzogskrone''\nFile:T12 F\u00fcrst.svg|''F\u00fcrstenkrone''\nFile:T10 Landgraf.svg|''Landgrafenkrone''\nFile:Rangkronen-Fig. 18.svg|''Grafenkrone''\nFile:Rangkronen-Fig. 27.svg|''Freiherrnkrone''\nFile:Rangkronen-Fig. 37.svg|''Adelskrone''\n</gallery>\n\nConsidering the religious nature of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], one can say that, except for the short-lived Napoleonic states, no continental secular system of heraldry historically was so neatly regulated as under the British crown. Still, there are often traditions (often connected to the Holy Roman Empire, ''e.g.'', those in Sweden, Denmark or Russia) that include the use of crown and coronets. While most languages do not have a specific term for coronets, but simply use the word meaning ''crown'', it is possible to determine which of those crowns are for peerage or lower-level use, and thus can by analogy be called coronets.\n\nPrecisely because there are many traditions and more variation within some of these, there is a plethora of continental coronet types. Indeed, there are also some coronets for positions that do not exist or entitle one to a coronet in the [[Commonwealth]] tradition. Such a case in French (''ancien'', ''i.e.'', royal era) heraldry, where coronets of rank did not come into use before the 16th century, is the [[vidame]], whose [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/vidame.htm coronet (illustrated)] is a metal circle mounted with three visible crosses (there is no documentary or archeological evidence that such a coronet was ever made).\n\nOften, coronets are substituted by [[helmet]]s, or only worn on a helmet.\n\n=== Kingdom of Portugal coronet rankings ===\nThese coronets and crowns were used in Portuguese heraldry:\n<gallery>\nFile:Heraldic Royal Crown of Portugal - Eight Arches.svg|Royal [[Crown of Portugal]]\nFile:Crown of the Heir Apparent of the Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Prince]] (Heir Apparent)\nFile:Crown of the Prince of Beira.svg|[[Prince of Beira]]<br />(Heir Apparent's eldest son)\nFile:Coronet of an Infante - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Infante]] (Prince)\nFile:Coronet of a Duke - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Duke]]\nFile:Coronet of a Marquess - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Marquis]]\nFile:Coronet of Count - Portugal.svg|[[Count]]\nFile:Coronet of a Viscount - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Viscount]]\nFile:Coronet of Baron - Portugal.svg|[[Baron]]\nFile:Coronet of Knight - Portugal.svg|[[Knight]] / ''[[Fidalgo]]''\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Polos]]\n*[[Corolla (headgear)]]\n*[[Tiara]]\n*[[Crown (heraldry)]]\n*[[Phra Kiao]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Sources and external links==\n*[http://www.geocities.ws/noelcox/coronets.htm The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage]\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/ Heraldica.org French heraldry]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040125063521/http://www.norfolkheraldry.co.uk/awebpages/our_patron.htm Illustration of the coat of arms of the Duke of Norfolk, showing the design of coronet]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809182337/http://www.clanjohnstone.org/AnnandalePeerageCase.html Illustration of the coat of arms of the Earl of Annandale and Hartfell, showing the design of coronet]\n*[http://www.heraldicsculptor.com/gartcres.html The Crowns, Coronets and Crests of the Ladies and Knights of the Garter]\n\n{{Types of Crowns}}\n{{heraldry}}\n\n[[Category:Crowns (headgear)]]\n[[Category:Formal insignia]]\n[[Category:Monarchy]]\n[[Category:Regalia]]\n[[Category:State ritual and ceremonies]]\n[[Category:Types of jewellery]]\n[[Category:Crowns in heraldry]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the [[headgear]]|other uses}}\n{{distinguish|text = the musical instrument [[cornet]], or other uses of the term [[Cornet (disambiguation)|Cornet]]}}\n{{broader|Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crowns, including coronets}}\n{{Confusing|reason=the clarity whether certain presented coronets are physical or purely heraldic is lacking|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:Coronet EarlOfDevon PowderhamCastle.jpg|thumb|Coronet of an Earl (as worn by the 17th [[Earl of Devon]] at the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Coronation of Elizabeth II]] and now on display at [[Powderham Castle]])]]\n\nA '''coronet''' is a small [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] consisting of ornaments fixed on a metal ring. By one definition, a coronet differs from a crown in that a coronet never has arches, and from a [[tiara]] in that a coronet completely encircles the head, while a tiara does not.  By a slightly different definition, a crown is worn by an emperor, empress, king or queen; a coronet by a [[nobleman]] or lady. See also [[diadem]].\n\nIn other languages, this distinction is not made as usually the same word for ''crown'' is used irrespective of rank (Krone in German, kroon in Dutch, krona in Swedish, couronne in French, etc.)\n\nThe main use is now actually not on the head (indeed, many people entitled to a coronet never have one made; the same even applies to some monarchs' crowns, as in Belgium) but as a [[rank symbol]] in [[heraldry]], adorning a [[coat of arms]].\n{{Heraldic achievement}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word stems from the Old French ''coronete'', a diminutive of ''co(u)ronne'' (\"crown\"), itself from the Latin ''corona'' (also \"wreath\"), from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7 (kor\u014dn\u0113, \"garland, wreath\").\n\nTraditionally, such headgear is \u2013 as indicated by the German equivalent ''Adelskrone'' (literally \"crown of nobility\") \u2013 used by [[Nobility|noble]]s and by princes and princesses in their [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]], rather than by [[monarch]]s, for whom the word ''crown'' is customarily reserved in formal English, while many languages have no such terminological distinction. Other than a crown, a coronet shows the rank of the respective noble. Hence, in [[German language|German]] and [[Scandinavia]]n languages there is also the term ''Rangkrone''.\n\nFor equivalents, both physical and emblematic, in other languages and cultures, see under [[crown (headgear)]].\n\n==Commonwealth usage==\n[[File:St Mary Magdalene, Croome, Worcs - Memorial to 4th Baron Coventry (1654\u20131687) coronet.JPG|thumb|Depiction of a baron's coronet on a 17th-century funerary monument]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a [[Peerage|peer]] wears his or her coronet on one occasion only: for a [[Coronation of the British monarch|royal coronation]], when it is worn along with [[Robes of the British peerage|coronation robes]], equally standardised as a luxurious uniform.\n\nIn the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerages of the United Kingdom]]<!-- please do not link to \"Peerage of the United Kingdom\"; that only refers to the titles created in the last 200 years -->, the design of a coronet shows the rank of its owner, as in German, French and various other heraldic traditions.  Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were [[engraving|engraved]] while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.<ref name=\"cox\">Cox, Noel (1999).

They were made, according to regulations made by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1661, shortly after his return from exile in France (getting a taste for its lavish court style; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] started monumental work at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] that year) during [[the Restoration]].

Helms were reserved for nobles, titled or untitled, by the 16th century regulations that were universally ignored. In principle, a helm without coronet indicated an untitled noble, chevalier or \u00e9cuyer (on this distinction, see  a discussion of the French nobility).\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Crown of France.svg|[[King of France|Roi]]\nFile:Crown of the Dauphin of France.svg|[[Dauphin of France]]\nFile:Crown of a Royal Prince of the Blood of France.svg|[[Fils de France]] et [[Petit-Fils de France]]\nFile:Crown of a Prince of the Blood of France.svg|[[Prince du Sang]]\nFile:Crown of a Duke of France.svg|[[Duc]] (Peer)\nFile:Crown of a Duke of France (variant).svg|[[Duc]]\nFile:Crown of a Marquis of France.svg|[[Marquis]] (Peer)\nFile:Crown of a Marquis of France (variant).svg|[[Marquis]]\nFile:Crown of a Count of France.svg|[[Count|Comte]] (Peer)\nFile:Crown of a Count of France (variant).svg|[[Count|Comte]]\nFile:Old Crown of a Count (France & Belgium).svg|[[Count|Comte]] (older variant)\nFile:Crown of a Viscount of France (variant).svg|[[Viscount]]\nFile:Crown of a Vidame of France.svg|[[Vidame]]\nFile:Crown of a Baron of France.svg|[[Baron]]\nFile:Crown of a Chevalier of France.svg|Chevalier\n</gallery>\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]], and consequently its successor states (Austria, Germany and others), had a system very similar to that of the British, although the design varied.\n\n*''Herzogskrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Herzog]]'' (duke) displays five visible leaves, with a crimson bonnet on top, surmounted by five visible arches and a ''[[globus cruciger]]''.\n*''F\u00fcrstenkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (prince) shows five visible leaves, with a crimson bonnet on top, surmounted by three visible arches and a ''globus cruciger''.\n*''Landgrafenkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Landgrave|Landgraf]]'' (landgrave) shows five visible leaves, surmounted by three visible arches and a ''globus cruciger''.\n*''Grafenkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Graf]]'' (count) displays nine visible tines with pearls. Some of the senior comital houses used coronets showing five leaves and four pearls (some mediatized counties and minor principalities had other types of coronets that distinguished them from regular counts).\n*''Freiherrnkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Freiherr]]'' (baron) shows seven visible tines with pearls.\n*''Adelskrone'': the coronet of ''[[German nobility|Adel]]'' members (untitled nobility) displays five visible tines with pearls. Sometimes, the central and outer tines are leaves and the other tines are headed by pearls. In the southern states of [[Bavaria]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], usually all tines are headed by pearls.\n<gallery>\nFile:T09 Herzog.svg|''Herzogskrone''\nFile:T12 F\u00fcrst.svg|''F\u00fcrstenkrone''\nFile:T10 Landgraf.svg|''Landgrafenkrone''\nFile:Rangkronen-Fig. 18.svg|''Grafenkrone''\nFile:Rangkronen-Fig. 27.svg|''Freiherrnkrone''\nFile:Rangkronen-Fig. 37.svg|''Adelskrone''\n</gallery>\n\nConsidering the religious nature of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], one can say that, except for the short-lived Napoleonic states, no continental secular system of heraldry historically was so neatly regulated as under the British crown. Still, there are often traditions (often connected to the Holy Roman Empire, ''e.g.'', those in Sweden, Denmark or Russia) that include the use of crown and coronets. While most languages do not have a specific term for coronets, but simply use the word meaning ''crown'', it is possible to determine which of those crowns are for peerage or lower-level use, and thus can by analogy be called coronets.\n\nPrecisely because there are many traditions and more variation within some of these, there is a plethora of continental coronet types. Indeed, there are also some coronets for positions that do not exist or entitle one to a coronet in the [[Commonwealth]] tradition. Such a case in French (''ancien'', ''i.e.'', royal era) heraldry, where coronets of rank did not come into use before the 16th century, is the [[vidame]], whose [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/vidame.htm coronet (illustrated)] is a metal circle mounted with three visible crosses (there is no documentary or archeological evidence that such a coronet was ever made).\n\nOften, coronets are substituted by [[helmet]]s, or only worn on a helmet.\n\n=== Kingdom of Portugal coronet rankings ===\nThese coronets and crowns were used in Portuguese heraldry:\n<gallery>\nFile:Heraldic Royal Crown of Portugal - Eight Arches.svg|Royal [[Crown of Portugal]]\nFile:Crown of the Heir Apparent of the Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Prince]] (Heir Apparent)\nFile:Crown of the Prince of Beira.svg|[[Prince of Beira]]<br />(Heir Apparent's eldest son)\nFile:Coronet of an Infante - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Infante]] (Prince)\nFile:Coronet of a Duke - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Duke]]\nFile:Coronet of a Marquess - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Marquis]]\nFile:Coronet of Count - Portugal.svg|[[Count]]\nFile:Coronet of a Viscount - Kingdom of Portugal.svg|[[Viscount]]\nFile:Coronet of Baron - Portugal.svg|[[Baron]]\nFile:Coronet of Knight - Portugal.svg|[[Knight]] / ''[[Fidalgo]]''\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Polos]]\n*[[Corolla (headgear)]]\n*[[Tiara]]\n*[[Crown (heraldry)]]\n*[[Phra Kiao]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Sources and external links==\n*[http://www.geocities.ws/noelcox/coronets.htm The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage]\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/ Heraldica.org French heraldry]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040125063521/http://www.norfolkheraldry.co.uk/awebpages/our_patron.htm Illustration of the coat of arms of the Duke of Norfolk, showing the design of coronet]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809182337/http://www.clanjohnstone.org/AnnandalePeerageCase.html Illustration of the coat of arms of the Earl of Annandale and Hartfell, showing the design of coronet]\n*[http://www.heraldicsculptor.com/gartcres.html The Crowns, Coronets and Crests of the Ladies and Knights of the Garter]\n\n{{Types of Crowns}}\n{{heraldry}}\n\n[[Category:Crowns (headgear)]]\n[[Category:Formal insignia]]\n[[Category:Monarchy]]\n[[Category:Regalia]]\n[[Category:State ritual and ceremonies]]\n[[Category:Types of jewellery]]\n[[Category:Crowns in heraldry]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "Migrating parameter format ofTemplate:Broader", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronet"}
