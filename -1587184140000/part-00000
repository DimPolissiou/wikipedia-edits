CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.<ref>ps://www.cdcr.ca.gov/about-cdcr/secretary CDCR Website<ref>\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course.

Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation).

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Selected prisons within the state are equipped with security housing units, reception centers, and/or \"condemned\" units.  These security levels are defined as follows:<ref name=CDCR2007>California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

However, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s\u2014despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s\u2014do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].\n\nGiven the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation\u2014and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question \"Why can't life evolve wheels?\" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial locomotion#Limbless locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question \"If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?\" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.<!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Known instances of rotation in biology==\nThere exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}\n\n===Rolling===\n[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]\n{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}\nSome organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}\n\nSeveral species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}\n\n[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,<ref>{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].<ref name=\"Main\"/> Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\n[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.<ref name=\"Howey\"/> Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}\n\n[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.<ref name=\"ABN\"/>\n\n[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Free rotation===\n====Macroscopic====\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width = 350\n | image1 = Nelson crystalline style1.png\n | alt1              = Illustrated dissection of the mussel ''[[Anodonta]]'', showing the crystalline style (\"st\") in black\n | caption1          = Mussel of the genus ''[[Anodonta]]'', with style (\"st\") shown in black\n | image2 = Nelson crystalline style2.png\n | alt2              = Illustrated dissection of the mussel ''[[Lampsilis]]'', showing the crystalline style (\"st\") in cross-section\n | caption2          = ''[[Lampsilis]]'' mussel, with style (\"st\") in cross-section\n}}\nAmong animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach.

The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}\n\n[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella \u2013 known as [[archaellum|archaella]] \u2013 driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili|type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}\n\nSome [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==\n\nThe absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}\n\n===Evolutionary constraints===\n[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness \"valley\" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]\n\nThe processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}\n\nAdaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728\u2013729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: \"The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]].\"{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable \"peak\", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that \"wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy\".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}\n\nNatural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}\n\nMolecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator\u2014free of the limitations imposed by evolution\u2014would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Developmental and anatomical constraints===\nUsing human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to\u2014or even capable of\u2014producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as \"wheels\", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}\n\nThe greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface to generate forward motion.{{r|Br\u00e4unl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be \"unwound\". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement, though these may be partly surmountable.\n\n====Power transmission to driven wheels====\n[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]\nIn the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}\n\n====Friction====\nReducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2\u20133}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}\n\n====Nutrient and waste transfer====\nAnother potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]] (of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed).{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}\n\n==Disadvantages of wheels==\nWheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the \"missed opportunity\" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not \"Why does nature not produce wheels?\", but rather, \"Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?\"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}\n\n===Efficiency===\n\n====Rolling resistance====\n[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on\u2014and deforming\u2014a soft surface, resulting in a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', with a component opposing the motion. (''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the supported portion of the vehicle; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''r'' is the wheel radius.)]]\n\nAlthough stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}\n\nRolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}\n\n====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====\nWhen moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%\u201398%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}\n\n===Traction===\nWheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]\u2014an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]\u2014on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}\u2014but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Obstacle navigation===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | perrow=2\n | align = right\n | total_width = 500\n | image1 = Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg | alt1 = Mountain goats on rocky terrain | caption1 = A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape.

Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400\u2013401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation on land are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}\n\n====Going around====\nAnatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}\n\n====Going over====\nWheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}\n\nIn addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWith unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable \u2013 that is, it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} [[Suspension (vehicle)|Suspension]] systems often mitigate the tendency of wheeled vehicles to overturn, but unlike fully articulated limbs, they do not provide any ability to recover from an overturned position.\n\n===Versatility===\nLimbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}\n\n{{anchor|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}\n\n==In fiction and legend==\n[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]\n{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}\nLegends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures.

Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n*[[Biomimicry]], which includes biologically inspired engineering\n*[[Projectile use by living systems]], another adaptation commonly associated with human technology\n*[[Robot locomotion]], in which locomotive issues faced by living systems are addressed in a technological context\n*[[Issus_(genus)|Issus]], a genus of planthoppers which use [[gear]] mechanisms to synchronize their legs while jumping\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"ABN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abnewswire.com/pressreleases/creative-bioarray-released-a-series-of-products-on-keratinocyte_110731.html |title=Creative Bioarray Released A Series of Products on Keratinocyte |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=April 19, 2017 |website=ABNewswire |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170823144043/http://www.abnewswire.com/pressreleases/creative-bioarray-released-a-series-of-products-on-keratinocyte_110731.html |archivedate=August 23, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.I. | last2 = Wang | first2 = Y.L. | last3 = Small | first3 = J.V. |title=Coordination of Protrusion and Translocation of the Keratocyte Involves Rolling of the Cell Body |journal=[[Journal of Cell Biology]] |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=1209\u20131218 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8794862 |pmc=2120980 |doi=10.1083/jcb.134.5.1209}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Andrae\">{{cite book |last=Andrae |first=Thomas |editor1-last=Heer |editor1-first=Jeet |editor2-last=Worcester |editor2-first=Kent |date=2009 |title=A Comics Studies Reader |chapter=The Garden in the Machine |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LUYhG9qO_8C&pg=PA278#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |page=278 |isbn=978-1-60473-109-5 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"anthony\">{{Cite book | last = Anthony | first = Piers | authorlink = Piers Anthony | title = Cluster | publisher = Avon Books | date = October 1977 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | via = Google Books | pages = 18\u201320,143 | isbn = 978-1-61756-013-2 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Applegate\">{{Cite book | last = Applegate | first = K.

However, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s\u2014despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s\u2014do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].\n\nGiven the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation\u2014and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question \"Why can't life evolve wheels?\" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial locomotion#Limbless locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question \"If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?\" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.<!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Known instances of rotation in biology==\nThere exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}\n\n===Rolling===\n[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]\n{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}\nSome organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}\n\nSeveral species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}\n\n[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,<ref>{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].<ref name=\"Main\"/> Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\n[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.<ref name=\"Howey\"/> Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}\n\n[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.<ref name=\"ABN\"/>\n\n[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Free rotation===\n====Macroscopic====\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width = 350\n | image1 = Nelson crystalline style1.png\n | alt1              = Illustrated dissection of the mussel ''[[Anodonta]]'', showing the crystalline style (\"st\") in black\n | caption1          = Mussel of the genus ''[[Anodonta]]'', with style (\"st\") shown in black\n | image2 = Nelson crystalline style2.png\n | alt2              = Illustrated dissection of the mussel ''[[Lampsilis]]'', showing the crystalline style (\"st\") in cross-section\n | caption2          = ''[[Lampsilis]]'' mussel, with style (\"st\") in cross-section\n}}\nAmong animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach.

The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}\n\n[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella \u2013 known as [[archaellum|archaella]] \u2013 driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili|type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}\n\nSome [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==\n\nThe absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}\n\n===Evolutionary constraints===\n[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness \"valley\" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]\n\nThe processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}\n\nAdaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728\u2013729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: \"The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]].\"{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable \"peak\", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that \"wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy\".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}\n\nNatural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}\n\nMolecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator\u2014free of the limitations imposed by evolution\u2014would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Developmental and anatomical constraints===\nUsing human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to\u2014or even capable of\u2014producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as \"wheels\", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}\n\nThe greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface to generate forward motion.{{r|Br\u00e4unl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be \"unwound\". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement, though these may be partly surmountable.\n\n====Power transmission to driven wheels====\n[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]\nIn the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}\n\n====Friction====\nReducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2\u20133}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}\n\n====Nutrient and waste transfer====\nAnother potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]] (of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed).{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}\n\n==Disadvantages of wheels==\nWheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the \"missed opportunity\" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not \"Why does nature not produce wheels?\", but rather, \"Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?\"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}\n\n===Efficiency===\n\n====Rolling resistance====\n[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on\u2014and deforming\u2014a soft surface, resulting in a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', with a component opposing the motion. (''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the supported portion of the vehicle; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''r'' is the wheel radius.)]]\n\nAlthough stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}\n\nRolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}\n\n====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====\nWhen moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%\u201398%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}\n\n===Traction===\nWheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]\u2014an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]\u2014on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}\u2014but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Obstacle navigation===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | perrow=2\n | align = right\n | total_width = 500\n | image1 = Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg | alt1 = Mountain goats on rocky terrain | caption1 = A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape.

Without articulation, a vehicle in this position cannot right itself.\n}}\nWork by engineer [[Mieczys\u0142aw G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400\u2013401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation on land are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}\n\n====Going around====\nAnatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}\n\n====Going over====\nWheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}\n\nIn addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWith unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable \u2013 that is, it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} [[Suspension (vehicle)|Suspension]] systems often mitigate the tendency of wheeled vehicles to overturn, but unlike fully articulated limbs, they do not provide any ability to recover from an overturned position.\n\n===Versatility===\nLimbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}\n\n{{anchor|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}\n\n==In fiction and legend==\n[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]\n{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}\nLegends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures.

[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}\n\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D.

Among the most important, the [[Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre|September 23 Communist League]] was at the forefront of the conflict, active in several cities throughout Mexico, drawing heavily from [[Christian Socialist]] and [[Marxist]] student organizations. They carried out confrontations with Mexican security forces, several kidnappings, and attempted to kidnap [[Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo]], the sister of the president. In [[Guerrero]], the [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|Party of the Poor]], ostensibly fighting against landholder impunity and oppressive police practices in rural areas, was led by the ex-teacher [[Lucio Caba\u00f1as]]; they carried out ambushes of the army and security forces and the abduction of Guerrero's governor-elect.<ref name=informe />\n\nThe legalization of left-wing political parties in 1978 along with the amnesty of imprisoned and at large guerrillas caused a number of combatants to end militant struggle against the government.

As the citizens grew more determined to speak out against the government in the 1960s, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] continued to increase its terror tactics in the region. While that was done to keep the populace under its control, the constant stream of violence pushed many guerrillas to consider raising up arms against the PRI.<ref name=\"calderon2012\" />{{rp|46}}\n\nThe rising of guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s provided the state an excuse to focus its resources on suppressing the armed activities of the guerrillas. The army would become infamous for its tactics in repressing the rebels in the rural areas of Mexico, where such practices such as the [[death flight]]s were initiated.<ref name=\"Garcia 124\u2013140\">{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Jorge M.|date=November 2016|title=Reconstructing the Collective Memory of Mexico's Dirty War.|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=43| issue =  6|pages=124\u2013140|doi=10.1177/0094582X16669137}}</ref>\n\nThis period of state violence in the state of Guerrero helped to bring about numerous guerrilla organizations. One of the groups was the [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|Party of the Poor]] (PDLP), which was influenced by [[Marxism]] and people like [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> That group tended to be focused more on the rural regions like Guerrero, where they would be more likely to find support among the peasants there. The PDLP actions become more violent towards the rich after events such as the 1967 [[Atoyac massacre]], where leaders like [[Lucio Caba\u00f1as]] tried to use the peasants anger to bring about true revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=141}}</ref>\n\nAs the 1960s and 1970s would go on, the PDLP would gain attention around the nation for acts like its kidnapping of [[Ruben Figueroa]] who was a prominent  leader of the PRI.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=158}}</ref> While this act inspired those downtrodden by the government, this also marked the decline of the organization as the government began to focus more on taking out this guerrilla group. Eventually the army found and killed Caba\u00f1as on December 2, 1974 in an attempt to cause his movement to fall apart.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=160}}</ref> Another school teacher turned revolutionary, [[Genaro V\u00e1zquez Rojas]], founded the [[National Revolutionary Civic Association]] (ACNR) as a response to the governments actions in Guerrero. These two leaders and their movements emerged as the armed phase of this social struggle against a corrupt government, which would continue long after the deaths of the leaders.<ref name=\"calderon2012\" />{{rp|42}}\n\n== Torture ==\nTorture was one of the many tools used by the PRI-run state in its drive to keep the numerous guerrilla groups and political dissidents repressed. While torture was illegal in many countries during this time, the numerous [[authoritarian]] regimes that sprung up from the Cold War used it to great effect. The Mexican state used torture to get information from captured rebels and guerrillas about attacks and plans. This torturing would be done at any number of clandestine [[detention centers]], where guerrillas would be sent to before arriving at a legal prison so as the state's activities would be kept secret from outside sources.<ref name=\"Garcia 124\u2013140\"/> Typically both male and female guerrilla prisoners would be tortured at these areas.

As the citizens grew more determined to speak out against the government in the 1960s, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] continued to increase its terror tactics in the region. While that was done to keep the populace under its control, the constant stream of violence pushed many guerrillas to consider raising up arms against the PRI.<ref name=\"calderon2012\" />{{rp|46}}\n\nThe rising of guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s provided the state an excuse to focus its resources on suppressing the armed activities of the guerrillas.

One of the groups was the [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|Party of the Poor]] (PDLP), which was influenced by [[Marxism]] and people like [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> That group tended to be focused more on the rural regions like Guerrero, where they would be more likely to find support among the peasants there.

While torture was illegal in many countries during this time, the numerous [[authoritarian]] regimes that sprung up from the Cold War used it to great effect. The Mexican state used torture to get information from captured rebels and guerrillas about attacks and plans. This torturing would be done at any number of clandestine [[detention centers]], where guerrillas would be sent to before arriving at a legal prison so as the state's activities would be kept secret from outside sources.<ref name=\"Garcia 124\u2013140\"/> Typically both male and female guerrilla prisoners would be tortured at these areas.

It was ABBA's second chart-topping album of the year, the first being ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', and contained the brand new single \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", recorded in August 1979.\n\nA round-up of ABBA\u2019s hits since their first compilation album (released in 1975), the album exclusively included material recorded between the years 1976 and 1979 (albums ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', ''[[ABBA: The Album|The Album]]'' and ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'' plus non-album single \"[[Summer Night City]]\") - with one exception, \"Rock Me\" from 1975 album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'', issued as a single and became a top 5 hit in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] after the release of the band's first hits package ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'' and also part of the setlist on the 1979 world tour.\n\n\"[[Angeleyes]]\" was included primarily due to its success as a single in the UK, where it was the lead track of a double A-side with \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\". Elsewhere, \"Voulez-Vous\" had been the A-side in its own right but it was not included on the album.  However, the track \"I Wonder (Departure)\" was not believed to have been released as a single anywhere, but was featured.\n\n''Greatest Hits Vol. 2'' received massive commercial success in [[Japan]], selling in excess of 920,000 units on the chart (it was the best-selling album by non-domestic artists at the time, until [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''  each sold over 1 million copies in the 1980s).  It is certified Gold in the U.S.\n\n''Greatest Hits Vol. 2 ''was released on CD in 1982 by Polydor but was deleted from their ABBA CD range in 1992 when it was replaced with ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits|ABBA Gold]]''. It was also released in the US by Atlantic Records in 1983 with the same mastering as the Polydor CD but was discontinued there in the late 1980s as well.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Benny Andersson]] & [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]], except where noted.\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = \n| headline = Side A\n| title1 = [[Gimme!

It was ABBA's second chart-topping album of the year, the first being ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', and contained the brand new single \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", recorded in August 1979.\n\nA round-up of ABBA\u2019s hits since their first compilation album (released in 1975), the album exclusively included material recorded between the years 1976 and 1979 (albums ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', ''[[ABBA: The Album|The Album]]'' and ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'' plus non-album single \"[[Summer Night City]]\") - with one exception, \"Rock Me\" from 1975 album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'', issued as a single and became a top 5 hit in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] after the release of the band's first hits package ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'' and also part of the setlist on the 1979 world tour.\n\n\"[[Angeleyes]]\" was included primarily due to its success as a single in the UK, where it was the lead track of a double A-side with \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\". Elsewhere, \"Voulez-Vous\" had been the A-side in its own right but it was not included on the album.  However, the track \"I Wonder (Departure)\" was not believed to have been released as a single anywhere, but was featured.\n\n''Greatest Hits Vol. 2'' received massive commercial success in [[Japan]], selling in excess of 920,000 units on the chart (it was the best-selling album by non-domestic artists at the time, until [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''  each sold over 1 million copies in the 1980s).  It is certified Gold in the U.S.\n\n''Greatest Hits Vol. 2 ''was released on CD in 1982 by Polydor but was deleted from their ABBA CD range in 1992 when it was replaced with ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits|ABBA Gold]]''. It was also released in the US by Atlantic Records in 1983 with the same mastering as the Polydor CD but was discontinued there in the late 1980s as well.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Benny Andersson]] & [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]], except where noted.\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = \n| headline = Side A\n| title1 = [[Gimme!

{"title_page": "Fermat's principle", "text_new": "{{short description|Principle of least time}}\n{{anchor|Fig1}}[[File:Fermat Snellius.svg|thumb|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}1''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Fermat's principle in the case of refraction of light at a flat surface between (say) air and water. Given an object-point ''A'' in the air, and an observation point ''B'' in the water, the refraction point ''P'' is that which minimizes the time taken by the light to travel the path ''APB''. If we seek the required value of ''x'', we find that the angles ''&alpha;'' and ''&beta;'' satisfy [[Snell's&nbsp;law]].]]\n\n'''Fermat's principle''', also known as the '''principle of least time''', is the link between [[geometrical optics|ray&nbsp;optics]] and [[physical optics|wave&nbsp;optics]]. In its original \"strong\" form,<ref>Cf. [[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], p.{{nnbsp}}740.</ref> Fermat's principle states that the path taken by [[Line (geometry)#Ray|a ray]] between two given points is the path that can be traversed in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the \"least\" time with a time that is \"[[stationary point|stationary]]\" with respect to variations of the path &mdash; so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a ''second-order'' change in the traversal time. To put it loosely, a ray path is surrounded by close paths that can be traversed in ''very'' close times. It [[#A ray as a signal path (line of sight)|can be shown]] that this technical definition corresponds to more intuitive notions of a ray, such as a line of sight or the path of a narrow beam.\n<!-- Fermat's principle can be expressed in the forms of [[Maupertuis's principle|Maupertuis's]] and [[Hamilton's principle]]s in [[classical mechanics]]. -->\n\nFirst proposed by the French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1662, as a means of explaining the [[Snell's law|ordinary law of refraction]] of light (Fig.{{nnbsp}}1), Fermat's principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature. Not until the 19th century was it understood that nature's ability to test alternative paths is merely a fundamental property of waves.<ref>Cf.{{tsp}} [[#Young1809|Young, 1809]], p.{{nnbsp}}342; [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}294\u20136,{{tsp}}310\u201311}}; [[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}293n.</ref> If points ''A'' and ''B'' are given, a [[wavefront]] expanding from ''A'' sweeps all possible ray paths radiating from ''A'', whether they pass through ''B'' or not. If the wavefront reaches point ''B'', it sweeps not only the ''ray'' path(s) from ''A'' to ''B'', but also an infinitude of nearby paths with the same endpoints. Fermat's principle describes any ray that happens to reach point&nbsp;''B''; there is no implication that the ray \"knew\" the shortest path or \"intended\" to take that path.\n\n{{anchor|Fig2}}[[File:Fermat-Huygens principle.svg|thumb|320px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}2''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Two points {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|P&prime;}} on a path from ''A'' to ''B''. For the purposes of Fermat's principle, the propagation time from {{mvar|P}} to {{mvar|P&prime;}} is taken as for a point-source at {{mvar|P}}, not (e.g.) for an arbitrary wavefront ''W'' passing through {{mvar|P}}. The surface ''&Sigma;''{{hsp}} (with unit normal '''n\u0302''' at {{mvar|P&prime;}}) is the locus of points that a disturbance at {{mvar|P}} can reach in the same time that it takes to reach {{mvar|P&prime;}}; in other words, ''&Sigma;'' is the secondary wavefront with radius {{mvar|PP&prime;}}. (The medium is ''not'' assumed to be homogeneous or [[isotropy|isotropic]].)]]\n\nFor the purpose of comparing traversal times, the time from one point to the next nominated point is taken as if the first point were a ''point-source''.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte (1959)]] invokes the point-source condition at the outset (p.{{nnbsp}}294, col.{{nnbsp}}1).</ref> Without this condition, the traversal time would be ambiguous; for example, if the propagation time from {{mvar|P}} to {{mvar|P&prime;}} were reckoned from an arbitrary wavefront ''W'' containing {{mvar|P}}{{hsp}} (Fig.{{nnbsp}}2), that time could be made arbitrarily small by suitably angling the wavefront.\n\nTreating a point on the path as a source is the minimum requirement of [[Huygens' principle]], and is part of the [[#Derivation|explanation]] of Fermat's principle. But it [[#Equivalence to Huygens' construction|can also be shown]] that the geometric ''construction'' by which [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] tried to apply his own principle (as distinct from the principle itself) is simply an invocation of Fermat's principle.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte (1959)]] gives a proof based on [[calculus of variations]]. The present article offers a [[#Equivalence to Huygens' construction|simpler explanation]].</ref> Hence all the conclusions that Huygens drew from that construction &mdash; including, without limitation, the laws of rectilinear propagation of light, ordinary reflection, ordinary refraction, and the extraordinary refraction of \"[[Iceland spar|Iceland crystal]]\" (calcite) &mdash; are also consequences of Fermat's principle.\n\n{{vpad|1=1ex|clear=left}}\n\n== Derivation ==\n\n=== Sufficient conditions ===\n\nLet us suppose that:\n:(1)&nbsp; A disturbance propagates sequentially through a [[transmission medium|medium]] (a&nbsp;vacuum or some material, not necessarily homogeneous or [[isotropy|isotropic]]), without [[action at a distance]];\n\n:(2)&nbsp; During propagation, the influence of the disturbance at any intermediate point ''P'' upon surrounding points has a non-zero angular spread (as if ''P'' were a source), so that a disturbance originating at any point ''A'' arrives at any other point ''B'' via an infinitude of paths, by which ''B'' receives an infinitude of delayed versions of the disturbance at ''A'';<ref group=Note>Assumption (2) almost follows from (1) because: (a)&nbsp;to the extent that the disturbance at the intermediate point ''P'' can be represented by a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], its influence is omnidirectional; (b)&nbsp;to the extent that it can be represented by a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] in the supposed direction of propagation (as in a [[longitudinal wave]]), it has a non-zero component in a range of neighboring directions; and (c)&nbsp;to the extent that it can be represented by a vector ''across'' the supposed direction of propagation (as in a [[transverse wave]]), it has a non-zero component ''across'' a range of neighboring directions. Thus there are infinitely many paths from ''A'' to ''B'' because there are infinitely many paths radiating from every intermediate point ''P''.</ref> and\n\n:(3)&nbsp; These delayed versions of the disturbance will reinforce each other at ''B'' if they are synchronized within some tolerance.\n\nThen the various propagation paths from ''A'' to ''B'' will help each other if their traversal times agree within the said tolerance. For a small tolerance (in the limiting case), the permissible range of variations of the path is maximized if the path is such that its traversal time is ''stationary'' with respect to the variations, so that a variation of the path causes at most a ''second-order'' change in the traversal time.{{r|lipsons}}\n\nThe most obvious example of a stationarity in traversal time is a (local or global) minimum &mdash; that is, a path of ''least'' time, as in the \"strong\" form of Fermat's principle. But that condition is not essential to the argument.<ref group=Note>If a ray is reflected off a sufficiently concave surface, the point of reflection is such that the total traversal time is a local maximum, ''provided'' that the paths to and from the point of reflection, considered separately, are required to be possible ray paths. But Fermat's principle imposes no such restriction; and without that restriction it is always possible to vary the overall path so as to increase its traversal time. Thus the stationary traversal time of the ray path is never a local maximum (cf.&nbsp;[[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], p.{{nnbsp}}129n). But, as the case of the concave reflector shows, neither is it necessarily a local minimum. Hence it is ''not'' necessarily an extremum. We must therefore be content to call it a stationarity.</ref>\n\nHaving established that a path of stationary traversal time is reinforced by a maximally wide corridor of neighboring paths, we still need to explain how this reinforcement corresponds to intuitive notions of a ray. But, for brevity in the explanations, let us first ''define'' a ray path as a path of stationary traversal time.\n\n=== A ray as a signal path (line of sight) ===\n\nIf the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from ''A'' to ''B'' is substantially obstructed, this will significantly alter the disturbance reaching ''B'' from ''A'' &mdash; unlike a similar-sized obstruction ''outside'' any such corridor, blocking paths that do not reinforce each other. The former obstruction will significantly disrupt the signal reaching ''B'' from ''A'', while the latter will not; thus the ray path marks a ''signal'' path. If the signal is visible light, the former obstruction will significantly affect the appearance of an object at ''A'' as seen by an observer at ''B'', while the latter will not; so the ray path marks a ''line of sight''.\n\nIn optical experiments, a line of sight is routinely assumed to be a ray path.<ref>See (e.g.) [[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]], pp.{{nnbsp}}47,{{px2}}55,{{px2}}58,{{px2}}60,{{px2}}{{nowrap|82\u20136}}; [[#Opticks|Newton, 1730]], pp.{{nnbsp}}8,{{px2}}18,{{px2}}137,{{px2}}143,{{px2}}166,{{px2}}173.</ref>\n\n=== A ray as an energy path (beam) ===\n\n[[File:Concave lens.jpg|thumb|320px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}3''':{{big|&nbsp;}}An experiment demonstrating refraction (and partial reflection) of ''rays'' &mdash; approximated by, or contained in, narrow beams]]\n\nIf the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from ''A'' to ''B'' is substantially obstructed, this will significantly affect the ''energy''<ref group=Note>More precisely, the [[energy flux density]].</ref> reaching ''B'' from ''A'' &mdash; unlike a similar-sized obstruction outside any such corridor. Thus the ray path marks an ''energy'' path &mdash; as does a beam.\n\nSuppose that a wavefront expanding from point ''A'' passes point ''P'', which lies on a ray path from point ''A'' to point ''B''. By definition, all points on the wavefront have the same propagation time from ''A''. Now let the wavefront be blocked except for a window, centered on ''P'', and small enough to lie within the corridor of paths that reinforce the ray path from ''A'' to ''B''. Then all points on the unobstructed portion of the wavefront will have, nearly enough, equal propagation times to ''B'', but ''not'' to points in other directions, so that ''B'' will be in the direction of peak intensity of the beam admitted through the window.<ref>This is the essence of the argument given by Fresnel ([[#SecMem|1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}310\u201311}}).</ref> So the ray path marks the beam.

The discovery that ants are capable of similar calculations{{r|zyga-2013}} does not bridge the gap between the animate and the inanimate.\n\nIn contrast, the above assumptions (1) to (3) hold for any wavelike disturbance and explain Fermat's principle in purely [[mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]] terms, without any imputation of knowledge or purpose.\n\nThe principle applies to waves in general, including (e.g.) sound waves in fluids and elastic waves in solids.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}294.</ref> In a modified form, it even works for [[matter&nbsp;wave]]s: in [[quantum mechanics]], the [[classical limit|classical path]] of a particle is obtainable by applying Fermat's principle to the associated wave &mdash; except that, because the frequency may vary with the path, the stationarity is in the [[phase&nbsp;shift]] (or number of cycles) and not necessarily in the time.{{r|ogborn-taylor-2005|vanHouten-beenakker-1995-272}}\n\nFermat's principle is most familiar, however, in the case of visible [[light]]: it is the link between [[geometrical optics]], which describes certain optical phenomena in terms of ''rays'', and the [[wave theory of light]], which explains the same phenomena on the hypothesis that light consists of ''waves''.\n\n== Equivalence to Huygens' construction ==\n\n[[File:Huygens-construction-two-iterations.svg|thumb|280px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}4''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Two iterations of Huygens' construction. In the first iteration, the later wavefront {{mvar|W&prime;}} is derived from the earlier wavefront {{mvar|W}} by taking the envelope of all the secondary wavefronts (gray arcs) expanding in a given time from all the points (e.g., {{mvar|P}}) on {{mvar|W}}. The arrows show the ray directions.]]\n\nIn this article we distinguish between Huygens' ''principle'', which states that every point crossed by a traveling wave becomes the source of a secondary wave, and Huygens' ''construction'', which is described below.\n\nLet the surface {{mvar|W}} be a wavefront at time {{mvar|t}}, and let the surface {{mvar|W&prime;}} be the same wavefront at the later time{{hsp}} {{mvar|t{{hsp}}+{{hsp}}&Delta;t}}{{hsp}} (Fig.{{nnbsp}}4). Let {{mvar|P}} be a general point on {{mvar|W}}.

Hence the ray ''velocity'', in magnitude and direction, is the radial velocity of an infinitesimal secondary wavefront, and is generally a function of location and direction.<ref name=\"De Witte, 1959\">[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}294, col.{{nnbsp}}2.</ref>\n\nNow let {{mvar|Q}} be a point on {{mvar|W}} close to {{mvar|P}}, and let {{mvar|Q&prime;}} be a point on {{mvar|W&prime;}} close to {{mvar|P&prime;}}. Then, by the construction,\n:(i)&nbsp; the time taken for a secondary wavefront from {{mvar|P}} to reach {{mvar|Q&prime;}} has at most a second-order dependence on the displacement {{mvar|P&prime;Q&prime;}}, and\n:(ii)&nbsp; the time taken for a secondary wavefront to reach {{mvar|P&prime;}} from {{mvar|Q}} has at most a second-order dependence on the displacement {{mvar|PQ}}.\nBy (i), the ray path is a path of stationary traversal time from {{mvar|P}} to {{mvar|W&prime;}};<ref>Cf. [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}305.</ref> and by (ii), it is a path of stationary traversal time from a point on {{mvar|W}} to {{mvar|P&prime;}}.<ref>Cf. [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}296.</ref>\n\nSo Huygens' construction implicitly defines a ray path as ''a&nbsp;path of stationary traversal time between successive positions of a wavefront'', the time being reckoned from a ''point-source'' on the earlier wavefront.<ref group=Note>If the time were reckoned from the earlier wavefront as a whole, that time would everywhere be exactly {{mvar|&Delta;t}}, and it would be meaningless to speak of a \"stationary\" or \"least\" time.<br/>The \"stationary\" time will be the ''least'' time provided that the secondary wavefronts are more convex than the primary wavefronts (as in Fig.{{nnbsp}}4). That proviso, however, does not always hold. For example, if the primary wavefront, within the range of a secondary wavefront, converges to a focus and starts diverging again, the secondary wavefront will touch the later primary wavefront from the outside instead of the inside. To allow for such complexities, we must be content to say \"stationary\" time rather than \"least\" time.{{tsp}} Cf.&nbsp;[[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], pp.{{nnbsp}}128\u20139 (meaning of \"regular neighbourhood\").</ref> This conclusion remains valid if the secondary wavefronts are reflected or refracted by surfaces of discontinuity in the properties of the medium, provided that the comparison is restricted to the affect paths and the affected portions of the wavefronts.<ref group=Note>Moreover, using Huygens' construction to determine the law of reflection or refraction is a matter of seeking the path of stationary traversal time between two particular wavefronts; cf. [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}305\u20136.</ref>\n\nFermat's principle, however, is conventionally expressed in ''point-to-point'' terms, not wavefront-to-wavefront terms. Accordingly, let us modify the example by supposing that the wavefront which becomes surface {{mvar|W}} at time {{mvar|t}}, and which becomes surface {{mvar|W&prime;}} at the later time {{mvar|t{{hsp}}+{{hsp}}&Delta;t}}, is emitted from point {{mvar|A}} at time&nbsp;{{math|0}}. Let {{mvar|P}} be a point on {{mvar|W}} (as before), and {{mvar|B}} a point on {{mvar|W&prime;}}. And let {{mvar|A,W,{{hsp}}W&prime;,}} and {{mvar|B}} be given, so that the problem is to find {{mvar|P}}.\n\nIf {{mvar|P}} satisfies Huygens' construction, so that the secondary wavefront from {{mvar|P}} is tangential to {{mvar|W&prime;}} at {{mvar|B}}, then {{mvar|PB}} is a path of stationary traversal time from {{mvar|W}} to {{mvar|B}}. Adding the fixed time from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|W}}, we find that {{mvar|APB}} is the path of stationary traversal time from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} (possibly with a restricted domain of comparison, as noted above), in accordance with Fermat's principle. The argument works just as well in the converse direction. Thus Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle are geometrically equivalent.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte (1959)]] gives a more sophisticated proof of the same result, using [[calculus of variations]].</ref><ref group=Note>In Huygens' construction, the choice of the envelope of secondary wavefronts on the ''forward'' side of {{mvar|W}} &mdash; that is, the rejection of \"backward\" or \"retrograde\" secondary waves &mdash; is also explained by Fermat's principle. For example, in [[#Fig2|Fig.{{nnbsp}}2]], the traversal time of the path {{mvar|APP&prime;P}} (where the last leg \"doubles back\") is ''not'' stationary with respect to variation of {{mvar|P&prime;}}, but is maximally sensitive to movement of {{mvar|P&prime;}} along the leg {{mvar|PP&prime;}}.</ref>\n\nThrough this equivalence, Fermat's principle sustains Huygens' construction and thence all the conclusions that Huygens was able to draw from that construction. In short, \"The laws of geometrical optics may be derived from Fermat's principle\".<ref>The quote is from [[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], p.{{nnbsp}}740.</ref> With the exception of the Fermat-Huygens principle itself, these laws are special cases in the sense that they depend on further assumptions about the media. Two of them are mentioned under the next heading.\n\n== Special cases ==\n\n=== Isotropic media: Rays normal to wavefronts ===\n\nIn an isotropic medium, because the propagation speed is independent of direction, the secondary wavefronts that expand from points on a primary wavefront in a given ''infinitesimal'' time are spherical,<ref name=\"De Witte, 1959\" /> so that their radii are normal to their common tangent surface at the points of tangency. But their radii mark the ray directions, and their common tangent surface is a general wavefront. Thus the rays are normal (orthogonal) to the wavefronts.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}295, col.{{nnbsp}}1.</ref>\n\nBecause much of the teaching of optics concentrates on isotropic media, treating anisotropic media as an optional topic, the assumption that the rays are normal to the wavefronts can become so pervasive that even Fermat's principle is explained under that assumption,<ref>This occurs in [[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], pp.{{nnbsp}}128\u201330, and persists in later editions.</ref> although in fact Fermat's principle is more general.\n\n=== Homogeneous media: Rectilinear propagation ===\n\nIn a homogeneous medium (also called a ''uniform'' medium), all the secondary wavefronts that expand from a given primary wavefront {{mvar|W}} in a given time {{mvar|&Delta;t}} are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] and similarly oriented, so that their envelope {{mvar|W&prime;}} may be considered as the envelope of a ''single'' secondary wavefront which preserves its orientation while its center (source) moves over {{mvar|W}}. If {{mvar|P}} is its center while {{mvar|P&prime;}} is its point of tangency with {{mvar|W&prime;}}, then {{mvar|P&prime;}} moves parallel to {{mvar|P}}, so that the plane tangential to {{mvar|W&prime;}} at {{mvar|P&prime;}} is parallel to the plane tangential to {{mvar|W}} at {{mvar|P}}. Let another (congruent and similarly orientated) secondary wavefront be centered on {{mvar|P&prime;}}, moving with {{mvar|P}}, and let it meet its envelope {{mvar|W&Prime;}} at point {{mvar|P&Prime;}}. Then, by the same reasoning, the plane tangential to {{mvar|W&Prime;}} at {{mvar|P&Prime;}} is parallel to the other two planes. Hence, due to the congruence and similar orientations, the ray directions {{mvar|PP&prime;}} and {{mvar|P&prime;P&Prime;}} are the same (but not necessarily normal to the wavefronts, since the secondary wavefronts are not necessarily spherical). This construction can be repeated any number of times, giving a straight ray of any length. Thus a homogeneous medium admits rectilinear rays.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]] (p.{{nnbsp}}295, col.{{nnbsp}}1 and Figure&nbsp;2), states the result and condenses the explanation into one diagram.</ref>\n\n== Modern version ==\n\n=== Formulation in terms of refractive index ===\n\nLet a path {{math|&Gamma;}} extend from point {{mvar|A}} to point {{mvar|B}}.

As the author notes, the law of reflection itself is found in Proposition&nbsp;{{serif|XIX}} of [[Euclid's Optics|Euclid's ''Optics'']].</ref> In 1657, [[Pierre de Fermat]] received from [[Marin Cureau de la Chambre]] a copy of newly published treatise, in which La&nbsp;Chambre noted Hero's principle and complained that it did not work for refraction.<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}137\u20139; [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], p.{{nnbsp}}48.</ref>\n\nFermat replied that refraction might be brought into the same framework by supposing that light took the path of least ''resistance'', and that different media offered different resistances. His eventual solution, described in a letter to La&nbsp;Chambre dated 1&nbsp;January 1662, construed \"resistance\" as inversely proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least ''time''. That premise yielded the [[Snell's law|ordinary law of refraction]], provided that light traveled more slowly in the optically denser medium.<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}139,{{px2}}143\u20137; [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}48\u20139 (where, in footnote&nbsp;21, \"Descartes\" obviously should be \"Fermat\").</ref><ref group=Note>[[Ibn al-Haytham]], writing in [[Cairo]] in the 2nd decade of the 11th century, also believed that light took the path of least resistance and that denser media offered more resistance, but he retained a more conventional notion of \"resistance\". If this notion was to explain refraction, it required the resistance to vary with direction in a manner that was hard to reconcile with reflection. Meanwhile [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn&nbsp;Sahl]] had already arrived at the correct law of refraction by a different method; but his law was not propagated&nbsp;([[#Mihas06|Mihas, 2006]], pp.{{nnbsp}}761\u20135; [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}20\u201321,{{px2}}41).<br/>The problem solved by Fermat is mathematically equivalent to the following: given two points in different media with different densities, minimize the ''density-weighted'' length of the path between the two points. In [[Leuven|Louvain]], in 1634 (by which time [[Willebrord Snellius]] had rediscovered Ibn Sahl's law, and Descartes had derived it but not yet published it), the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] professor Wilhelm Boelmans gave a correct solution to this problem, and set its proof as an exercise for his Jesuit students&nbsp;([[#Zigg80|Ziggelaar, 1980]]).</ref>\n\nFermat's solution was a landmark in that it unified the then-known laws of geometrical optics under a ''[[variational principle]]'' or ''[[action (physics)|action principle]]'', setting the precedent for the [[principle of least action]] in classical mechanics and the corresponding principles in other fields (see ''[[History of variational principles in physics]]'').<ref>[[#Chaves16|Chaves, 2016]], chapters 14,{{tsp}}19.</ref> It was the more notable because it used the method of ''[[adequality]]'', which may be understood in retrospect as finding the point where the slope of an infinitesimally short [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is zero,<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}144\u20135.</ref> without the intermediate step of finding a general expression for the slope (the [[derivative]]).\n\nIt was also immediately controversial. The ordinary law of refraction was at that time attributed to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (d.{{nnbsp}}1650), who had tried to explain it by supposing that light was a force that propagated ''instantaneously'', or that light was analogous to a tennis ball that traveled ''faster'' in the denser medium,{{r|schuster-2000-261}}<ref>[[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}41\u20132.</ref> either premise being inconsistent with Fermat's.&nbsp; Descartes' most prominent defender, [[Claude Clerselier]], criticized Fermat for apparently ascribing knowledge and intent to nature, and for failing to explain why nature should prefer to economize on time rather than distance. Clerselier wrote in part:\n<blockquote>\n1. The principle that you take as the basis of your demonstration, namely that nature always acts in the shortest and simplest ways, is merely a moral principle and not a physical one; it is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in nature.... For otherwise we would attribute knowledge to nature; but here, by \"nature\", we understand only this order and this law established in the world as it is, which acts without foresight, without choice, and by a necessary determination.\n\n2.

The corpuscular speed that satisfied this principle was proportional to the reciprocal of the ray speed given by the radius of Huygens' spheroid. Laplace continued:\n<blockquote>\nAccording to Huygens, the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in the crystal, is simply expressed by the radius of the spheroid; consequently his hypothesis ''does not agree'' with the principle of the least action: but ''it is remarkable'' that it agrees with the principle of Fermat, which is, that light passes, from a given point without the crystal, to a given point within it, in the least possible time; for it is easy to see that this principle coincides with that of the least action, if we invert the expression of the velocity.<ref>Translated by [[#Young1809|Young (1809)]], p.{{nnbsp}}341; Young's italics.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|left|thumb|Thomas Young {{nowrap|(1773\u20131829)}}]]\n\nLaplace's report was the subject of a wide-ranging rebuttal by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], who wrote in part:\n<blockquote>\nThe principle of Fermat, although it was assumed by that mathematician on hypothetical, or even imaginary grounds, is in fact a fundamental law with respect to undulatory motion, and is {{sic|explicitly}} the basis of every determination in the Huygenian theory...&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Laplace seems to be unacquainted with this most essential principle of one of the two theories which he compares; for he says, that \"it is remarkable,\" that the Huygenian law of extraordinary refraction agrees with the principle of Fermat; which he would scarcely have observed, if he had been aware that the law was an immediate consequence of the principle.<ref>[[#Young1809|Young, 1809]], p.{{nnbsp}}342.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn fact Laplace ''was'' aware that Fermat's principle follows from Huygens' construction in the case of refraction from an isotropic medium to an anisotropic one; a geometric proof was contained in the long version of Laplace's report, printed in 1810.<ref>On the proof, see [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], p.{{nnbsp}}190.

Unfortunately, however, the omitted middle sentence of the quoted paragraph by Young began \"The motion of every undulation must necessarily be in a direction ''perpendicular'' to its surface...\" (emphasis added), and was therefore bound to sow confusion rather than clarity.\n\n[[File:Augustin Fresnel.jpg|thumb|Augustin-Jean Fresnel {{nowrap|(1788\u20131827)}}]]\n\nNo such confusion subsists in [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s \"Second Memoir\" on double refraction ([[#SecMem|Fresnel,&nbsp;1827]]), which addresses Fermat's principle in several places (without naming Fermat), proceeding from the special case in which rays are normal to wavefronts, to the general case in which rays are paths of least time or stationary time. (In the following summary, page numbers refer to [[#SecMem|Alfred W.{{tsp}}Hobson's translation]].)\n* For refraction of a plane wave at parallel incidence on one face of an anisotropic crystalline wedge (pp.{{nnbsp}}291\u20132), in order to find the \"first ray arrived\" at an observation point beyond the other face of the wedge, it suffices to treat the rays outside the crystal as normal to the wavefronts, and within the crystal to consider only the parallel wavefronts (whatever the ray direction). So in this case, Fresnel does not attempt to trace the complete ray path.<ref group=Note>In the translation, some lines and symbols are missing from the diagram; the corrected diagram may be found in Fresnel's ''Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes'', vol.{{nnbsp}}2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g6tzUG7JmoQC&pg=PA547 p.{{nnbsp}}547].</ref>\n\n* Next, Fresnel considers a ray refracted from a point-source ''M'' inside a crystal, through a point ''A'' on the surface, to an observation point ''B'' outside (pp.{{nnbsp}}294\u20136). The surface passing through ''B'' and given by the \"locus of the disturbances which arrive first\" is, according to Huygens' construction, normal to \"the ray ''AB'' of swiftest arrival\". But this construction requires knowledge of the \"surface of the wave\" (that is, the secondary wavefront) within the crystal.\n\n* Then he considers a plane wavefront propagating in a medium with non-spherical secondary wavefronts, oriented so that the ray path given by Huygens' construction &mdash; from the source of the secondary wavefront to its point of tangency with the subsequent primary wavefront &mdash; is ''not'' normal to the primary wavefronts (p.{{nnbsp}}296). He shows that this path is nevertheless \"the path of quickest arrival of the disturbance\" from the earlier primary wavefront to the point of tangency.\n\n* In a later heading (p.{{nnbsp}}305) he declares that \"The construction of Huygens, which determines the path of swiftest arrival,\" is applicable to secondary wavefronts of any shape. He then notes that when we apply Huygens' construction to refraction into a crystal with a two-sheeted secondary wavefront, and draw the lines from the two points of tangency to the center of the secondary wavefront, \"we shall have the directions of the two paths of swiftest arrival, and consequently of the ordinary and of the extraordinary ray.\"\n\n* Under the heading \"Definition of the word ''Ray''\" (p.{{nnbsp}}309), he concludes that this term must be applied to the line which joins the center of the secondary wave to a point on its surface, whatever the inclination of this line to the surface.\n\n* As a \"new consideration\" (pp.{{nnbsp}}310\u201311), he notes that if a plane wavefront is passed through a small hole centered on point ''E'', then the direction ''ED'' of maximum intensity of the resulting beam will be that in which the secondary wave starting from ''E'' will \"arrive there the first\", and the secondary wavefronts from opposite sides of the hole (equidistant from ''E'') will \"arrive at ''D'' in the same time\" as each other. This direction is ''not'' assumed to be normal to any wavefront.\nThus Fresnel showed, even for anisotropic media, that the ray path given by Huygens' construction is the path of least time between successive positions of a plane or diverging wavefront, that the ray velocities are the radii of the secondary \"wave surface\" after unit time, and that a stationary traversal time accounts for the direction of maximum intensity of a beam. However, establishing the general equivalence between Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle would have required further consideration of Fermat's principle in point-to-point terms.\n\n{{vpad|1=1ex}}\n\nAccording to [[#deWitte|Adriaan J.&nbsp;de Witte (1959)]], the equivalence of Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle was discussed by [[Hendrik Lorentz]] in 1907.{{r|lorentz-1907}} De&nbsp;Witte offers his own proof, which \"although in essence the same, is believed to be more cogent and more general.\" But, he notes, \"The matter seems to have escaped treatment in textbooks.\"<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}293n.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Action (physics)]]\n* [[Adequality]]\n* [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]\n* [[Birefringence]]\n* [[Calculus of variations]]\n* [[Eikonal equation]]\n* [[Fermat\u2019s and energy variation principles in field theory]]\n* [[Geodesic]]\n* [[Hamilton's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Path integral formulation]]\n* [[Pierre de Fermat]]\n* [[Principle of least action]]\n* [[Snell's law]]\n* [[Thomas Young (scientist)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=vanHouten-beenakker-1995-272>H. van Houten and C.W.J.&nbsp;Beenakker, 1995, [http://lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/beenakkr/mesoscopics/fulltext/172_108_Burstein.pdf \"Principles of solid state electron optics\"],{{tsp}} in{{tsp}} E.&nbsp;Burstein and C.&nbsp;Weisbuch (eds.), ''Confined Electrons and Photons: New Physics and Applications'' (NATO ASI Series; Series&nbsp;B: Physics, vol.{{nnbsp}}340), Boston, MA: Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4615-1963-8}}, {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}269\u2013303}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4615-1963-8_9}}, at {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}272\u20133}}.</ref>\n\n<ref name=clerselier-1662>Clerselier to Fermat (in&nbsp;French), 6&nbsp;May 1662,{{tsp}} in{{tsp}} P.{{nnbsp}}Tannery and C.{{nnbsp}}Henry (eds.), ''\u0152uvres de Fermat'', vol.{{nnbsp}}2 (Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1894), [https://archive.org/stream/oeuvresdefermat02ferm/#page/464 pp.{{nnbsp}}464\u201372].</ref>\n\n<ref name=fermat-1662-clerselier>Fermat to Clerselier (in&nbsp;French), 21&nbsp;May 1662,{{tsp}} in{{tsp}} P.{{nnbsp}}Tannery and C.{{nnbsp}}Henry (eds.), ''\u0152uvres de Fermat'', vol.{{nnbsp}}2 (Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1894), [https://archive.org/stream/oeuvresdefermat02ferm/#page/482 pp.{{nnbsp}}482\u20134].</ref>\n\n<ref name=feynman-1988-51>R.P.

In its original \"strong\" form,<ref>Cf. [[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], p.{{nnbsp}}740.</ref> Fermat's principle states that the path taken by [[Line (geometry)#Ray|a ray]] between two given points is the path that can be traversed in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the \"least\" time with a time that is \"[[stationary point|stationary]]\" with respect to variations of the path &mdash; so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a ''second-order'' change in the traversal time. To put it loosely, a ray path is surrounded by close paths that can be traversed in ''very'' close times. It [[#A ray as a signal path (line of sight)|can be shown]] that this technical definition corresponds to more intuitive notions of a ray, such as a line of sight or the path of a narrow beam.\n<!-- Fermat's principle can be expressed in the forms of [[Maupertuis's principle|Maupertuis's]] and [[Hamilton's principle]]s in [[classical mechanics]]. -->\n\nFirst proposed by the French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1662, as a means of explaining the [[Snell's law|ordinary law of refraction]] of light (Fig.{{nnbsp}}1), Fermat's principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature. Not until the 19th century was it understood that nature's ability to test alternative paths is merely a fundamental property of waves.<ref>Cf.{{tsp}} [[#Young1809|Young, 1809]], p.{{nnbsp}}342; [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}294\u20136,{{tsp}}310\u201311}}; [[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}293n.</ref> If points ''A'' and ''B'' are given, a [[wavefront]] expanding from ''A'' sweeps all possible ray paths radiating from ''A'', whether they pass through ''B'' or not. If the wavefront reaches point ''B'', it sweeps not only the ''ray'' path(s) from ''A'' to ''B'', but also an infinitude of nearby paths with the same endpoints. Fermat's principle describes any ray that happens to reach point&nbsp;''B''; there is no implication that the ray \"knew\" the shortest path or \"intended\" to take that path.\n\n{{anchor|Fig2}}[[File:Fermat-Huygens principle.svg|thumb|320px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}2''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Two points {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|P&prime;}} on a path from ''A'' to ''B''. For the purposes of Fermat's principle, the propagation time from {{mvar|P}} to {{mvar|P&prime;}} is taken as for a point-source at {{mvar|P}}, not (e.g.) for an arbitrary wavefront ''W'' passing through {{mvar|P}}. The surface ''&Sigma;''{{hsp}} (with unit normal '''n\u0302''' at {{mvar|P&prime;}}) is the locus of points that a disturbance at {{mvar|P}} can reach in the same time that it takes to reach {{mvar|P&prime;}}; in other words, ''&Sigma;'' is the secondary wavefront with radius {{mvar|PP&prime;}}. (The medium is ''not'' assumed to be homogeneous or [[isotropy|isotropic]].)]]\n\nFor the purpose of comparing traversal times, the time from one point to the next nominated point is taken as if the first point were a ''point-source''.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte (1959)]] invokes the point-source condition at the outset (p.{{nnbsp}}294, col.{{nnbsp}}1).</ref> Without this condition, the traversal time would be ambiguous; for example, if the propagation time from {{mvar|P}} to {{mvar|P&prime;}} were reckoned from an arbitrary wavefront ''W'' containing {{mvar|P}}{{hsp}} (Fig.{{nnbsp}}2), that time could be made arbitrarily small by suitably angling the wavefront.\n\nTreating a point on the path as a source is the minimum requirement of [[Huygens' principle]], and is part of the [[#Derivation|explanation]] of Fermat's principle. But it [[#Equivalence to Huygens' construction|can also be shown]] that the geometric ''construction'' by which [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] tried to apply his own principle (as distinct from the principle itself) is simply an invocation of Fermat's principle.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte (1959)]] gives a proof based on [[calculus of variations]]. The present article offers a [[#Equivalence to Huygens' construction|simpler explanation]].</ref> Hence all the conclusions that Huygens drew from that construction &mdash; including, without limitation, the laws of rectilinear propagation of light, ordinary reflection, ordinary refraction, and the extraordinary refraction of \"[[Iceland spar|Iceland crystal]]\" (calcite) &mdash; are also consequences of Fermat's principle.\n\n{{vpad|1=1ex|clear=left}}\n\n== Derivation ==\n\n=== Sufficient conditions ===\n\nLet us suppose that:\n:(1)&nbsp; A disturbance propagates sequentially through a [[transmission medium|medium]] (a&nbsp;vacuum or some material, not necessarily homogeneous or [[isotropy|isotropic]]), without [[action at a distance]];\n\n:(2)&nbsp; During propagation, the influence of the disturbance at any intermediate point ''P'' upon surrounding points has a non-zero angular spread (as if ''P'' were a source), so that a disturbance originating at any point ''A'' arrives at any other point ''B'' via an infinitude of paths, by which ''B'' receives an infinitude of delayed versions of the disturbance at ''A'';<ref group=Note>Assumption (2) almost follows from (1) because: (a)&nbsp;to the extent that the disturbance at the intermediate point ''P'' can be represented by a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], its influence is omnidirectional; (b)&nbsp;to the extent that it can be represented by a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] in the supposed direction of propagation (as in a [[longitudinal wave]]), it has a non-zero component in a range of neighboring directions; and (c)&nbsp;to the extent that it can be represented by a vector ''across'' the supposed direction of propagation (as in a [[transverse wave]]), it has a non-zero component ''across'' a range of neighboring directions. Thus there are infinitely many paths from ''A'' to ''B'' because there are infinitely many paths radiating from every intermediate point ''P''.</ref> and\n\n:(3)&nbsp; These delayed versions of the disturbance will reinforce each other at ''B'' if they are synchronized within some tolerance.\n\nThen the various propagation paths from ''A'' to ''B'' will help each other if their traversal times agree within the said tolerance. For a small tolerance (in the limiting case), the permissible range of variations of the path is maximized if the path is such that its traversal time is ''stationary'' with respect to the variations, so that a variation of the path causes at most a ''second-order'' change in the traversal time.{{r|lipsons}}\n\nThe most obvious example of a stationarity in traversal time is a (local or global) minimum &mdash; that is, a path of ''least'' time, as in the \"strong\" form of Fermat's principle. But that condition is not essential to the argument.<ref group=Note>If a ray is reflected off a sufficiently concave surface, the point of reflection is such that the total traversal time is a local maximum, ''provided'' that the paths to and from the point of reflection, considered separately, are required to be possible ray paths. But Fermat's principle imposes no such restriction; and without that restriction it is always possible to vary the overall path so as to increase its traversal time. Thus the stationary traversal time of the ray path is never a local maximum (cf.&nbsp;[[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], p.{{nnbsp}}129n). But, as the case of the concave reflector shows, neither is it necessarily a local minimum. Hence it is ''not'' necessarily an extremum. We must therefore be content to call it a stationarity.</ref>\n\nHaving established that a path of stationary traversal time is reinforced by a maximally wide corridor of neighboring paths, we still need to explain how this reinforcement corresponds to intuitive notions of a ray. But, for brevity in the explanations, let us first ''define'' a ray path as a path of stationary traversal time.\n\n=== A ray as a signal path (line of sight) ===\n\nIf the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from ''A'' to ''B'' is substantially obstructed, this will significantly alter the disturbance reaching ''B'' from ''A'' &mdash; unlike a similar-sized obstruction ''outside'' any such corridor, blocking paths that do not reinforce each other. The former obstruction will significantly disrupt the signal reaching ''B'' from ''A'', while the latter will not; thus the ray path marks a ''signal'' path. If the signal is visible light, the former obstruction will significantly affect the appearance of an object at ''A'' as seen by an observer at ''B'', while the latter will not; so the ray path marks a ''line of sight''.\n\nIn optical experiments, a line of sight is routinely assumed to be a ray path.<ref>See (e.g.) [[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]], pp.{{nnbsp}}47,{{px2}}55,{{px2}}58,{{px2}}60,{{px2}}{{nowrap|82\u20136}}; [[#Opticks|Newton, 1730]], pp.{{nnbsp}}8,{{px2}}18,{{px2}}137,{{px2}}143,{{px2}}166,{{px2}}173.</ref>\n\n=== A ray as an energy path (beam) ===\n\n[[File:Concave lens.jpg|thumb|320px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}3''':{{big|&nbsp;}}An experiment demonstrating refraction (and partial reflection) of ''rays'' &mdash; approximated by, or contained in, narrow beams]]\n\nIf the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from ''A'' to ''B'' is substantially obstructed, this will significantly affect the ''energy''<ref group=Note>More precisely, the [[energy flux density]].</ref> reaching ''B'' from ''A'' &mdash; unlike a similar-sized obstruction outside any such corridor. Thus the ray path marks an ''energy'' path &mdash; as does a beam.\n\nSuppose that a wavefront expanding from point ''A'' passes point ''P'', which lies on a ray path from point ''A'' to point ''B''. By definition, all points on the wavefront have the same propagation time from ''A''. Now let the wavefront be blocked except for a window, centered on ''P'', and small enough to lie within the corridor of paths that reinforce the ray path from ''A'' to ''B''. Then all points on the unobstructed portion of the wavefront will have, nearly enough, equal propagation times to ''B'', but ''not'' to points in other directions, so that ''B'' will be in the direction of peak intensity of the beam admitted through the window.<ref>This is the essence of the argument given by Fresnel ([[#SecMem|1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}310\u201311}}).</ref> So the ray path marks the beam. And in optical experiments, a beam is routinely considered as a collection of rays or (if it is narrow) as an approximation to a ray (Fig.{{nnbsp}}3).<ref>See (e.g.) [[#Opticks|Newton, 1730]], p.{{nnbsp}}55; [[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]], pp.{{nnbsp}}40\u201341,{{tsp}}56.</ref>\n\n=== Analogies ===\n\nAccording to the \"strong\" form of Fermat's principle, the problem of finding the path of a light ray from point ''A'' in a medium of faster propagation, to point ''B'' in a medium of slower propagation ([[#Fig1|Fig.{{nnbsp}}1]]), is analogous to the problem faced by a [[lifeguard]] in deciding where to enter the water in order to reach a drowning swimmer as soon as possible, given that the lifeguard can run faster than (s)he can swim.{{r|feynman-1988-51}} But that analogy falls short of ''explaining'' the behavior of the light, because the lifeguard can think about the problem (even if only for an instant) whereas the light presumably cannot. The discovery that ants are capable of similar calculations{{r|zyga-2013}} does not bridge the gap between the animate and the inanimate.\n\nIn contrast, the above assumptions (1) to (3) hold for any wavelike disturbance and explain Fermat's principle in purely [[mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]] terms, without any imputation of knowledge or purpose.\n\nThe principle applies to waves in general, including (e.g.) sound waves in fluids and elastic waves in solids.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}294.</ref> In a modified form, it even works for [[matter&nbsp;wave]]s: in [[quantum mechanics]], the [[classical limit|classical path]] of a particle is obtainable by applying Fermat's principle to the associated wave &mdash; except that, because the frequency may vary with the path, the stationarity is in the [[phase&nbsp;shift]] (or number of cycles) and not necessarily in the time.{{r|ogborn-taylor-2005|vanHouten-beenakker-1995-272}}\n\nFermat's principle is most familiar, however, in the case of visible [[light]]: it is the link between [[geometrical optics]], which describes certain optical phenomena in terms of ''rays'', and the [[wave theory of light]], which explains the same phenomena on the hypothesis that light consists of ''waves''.\n\n== Equivalence to Huygens' construction ==\n\n[[File:Huygens-construction-two-iterations.svg|thumb|280px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}4''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Two iterations of Huygens' construction. In the first iteration, the later wavefront {{mvar|W&prime;}} is derived from the earlier wavefront {{mvar|W}} by taking the envelope of all the secondary wavefronts (gray arcs) expanding in a given time from all the points (e.g., {{mvar|P}}) on {{mvar|W}}. The arrows show the ray directions.]]\n\nIn this article we distinguish between Huygens' ''principle'', which states that every point crossed by a traveling wave becomes the source of a secondary wave, and Huygens' ''construction'', which is described below.\n\nLet the surface {{mvar|W}} be a wavefront at time {{mvar|t}}, and let the surface {{mvar|W&prime;}} be the same wavefront at the later time{{hsp}} {{mvar|t{{hsp}}+{{hsp}}&Delta;t}}{{hsp}} (Fig.{{nnbsp}}4). Let {{mvar|P}} be a general point on {{mvar|W}}. Then, according to Huygens construction,<ref>[[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]], pp.{{nnbsp}}19,{{px2}}50\u201351,{{px2}}63\u201365,{{px2}}68,{{px2}}75.</ref>\n:(a)&nbsp; {{mvar|W&prime;}} is the ''[[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]]'' (common tangent surface), on the forward side of {{mvar|W}}, of all the secondary wavefronts each of which would expand in time {{mvar|&Delta;t}} from a point on {{mvar|W}}, and\n:(b)&nbsp; if the secondary wavefront expanding from point {{mvar|P}} in time {{mvar|&Delta;t}} touches the surface {{mvar|W&prime;}} at point {{mvar|P&prime;}}, then ''{{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|P&prime;}} lie on a ray''.\nThe construction may be repeated in order to find successive positions of the primary wavefront, and successive points on the ray.\n\nThe ray direction given by this construction is the radial direction of the secondary wavefront,<ref>[[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}309.</ref> and may differ from the normal of the secondary wavefront (cf.&nbsp;[[#Fig2|Fig.{{nnbsp}}2]]), and therefore from the normal of the primary wavefront at the point of tangency. Hence the ray ''velocity'', in magnitude and direction, is the radial velocity of an infinitesimal secondary wavefront, and is generally a function of location and direction.<ref name=\"De Witte, 1959\">[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}294, col.{{nnbsp}}2.</ref>\n\nNow let {{mvar|Q}} be a point on {{mvar|W}} close to {{mvar|P}}, and let {{mvar|Q&prime;}} be a point on {{mvar|W&prime;}} close to {{mvar|P&prime;}}. Then, by the construction,\n:(i)&nbsp; the time taken for a secondary wavefront from {{mvar|P}} to reach {{mvar|Q&prime;}} has at most a second-order dependence on the displacement {{mvar|P&prime;Q&prime;}}, and\n:(ii)&nbsp; the time taken for a secondary wavefront to reach {{mvar|P&prime;}} from {{mvar|Q}} has at most a second-order dependence on the displacement {{mvar|PQ}}.\nBy (i), the ray path is a path of stationary traversal time from {{mvar|P}} to {{mvar|W&prime;}};<ref>Cf. [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}305.</ref> and by (ii), it is a path of stationary traversal time from a point on {{mvar|W}} to {{mvar|P&prime;}}.<ref>Cf. [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}296.</ref>\n\nSo Huygens' construction implicitly defines a ray path as ''a&nbsp;path of stationary traversal time between successive positions of a wavefront'', the time being reckoned from a ''point-source'' on the earlier wavefront.<ref group=Note>If the time were reckoned from the earlier wavefront as a whole, that time would everywhere be exactly {{mvar|&Delta;t}}, and it would be meaningless to speak of a \"stationary\" or \"least\" time.<br/>The \"stationary\" time will be the ''least'' time provided that the secondary wavefronts are more convex than the primary wavefronts (as in Fig.{{nnbsp}}4). That proviso, however, does not always hold. For example, if the primary wavefront, within the range of a secondary wavefront, converges to a focus and starts diverging again, the secondary wavefront will touch the later primary wavefront from the outside instead of the inside. To allow for such complexities, we must be content to say \"stationary\" time rather than \"least\" time.{{tsp}} Cf.&nbsp;[[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], pp.{{nnbsp}}128\u20139 (meaning of \"regular neighbourhood\").</ref> This conclusion remains valid if the secondary wavefronts are reflected or refracted by surfaces of discontinuity in the properties of the medium, provided that the comparison is restricted to the affect paths and the affected portions of the wavefronts.<ref group=Note>Moreover, using Huygens' construction to determine the law of reflection or refraction is a matter of seeking the path of stationary traversal time between two particular wavefronts; cf. [[#SecMem|Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson]], p.{{nnbsp}}305\u20136.</ref>\n\nFermat's principle, however, is conventionally expressed in ''point-to-point'' terms, not wavefront-to-wavefront terms. Accordingly, let us modify the example by supposing that the wavefront which becomes surface {{mvar|W}} at time {{mvar|t}}, and which becomes surface {{mvar|W&prime;}} at the later time {{mvar|t{{hsp}}+{{hsp}}&Delta;t}}, is emitted from point {{mvar|A}} at time&nbsp;{{math|0}}. Let {{mvar|P}} be a point on {{mvar|W}} (as before), and {{mvar|B}} a point on {{mvar|W&prime;}}. And let {{mvar|A,W,{{hsp}}W&prime;,}} and {{mvar|B}} be given, so that the problem is to find {{mvar|P}}.\n\nIf {{mvar|P}} satisfies Huygens' construction, so that the secondary wavefront from {{mvar|P}} is tangential to {{mvar|W&prime;}} at {{mvar|B}}, then {{mvar|PB}} is a path of stationary traversal time from {{mvar|W}} to {{mvar|B}}. Adding the fixed time from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|W}}, we find that {{mvar|APB}} is the path of stationary traversal time from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} (possibly with a restricted domain of comparison, as noted above), in accordance with Fermat's principle. The argument works just as well in the converse direction. Thus Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle are geometrically equivalent.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte (1959)]] gives a more sophisticated proof of the same result, using [[calculus of variations]].</ref><ref group=Note>In Huygens' construction, the choice of the envelope of secondary wavefronts on the ''forward'' side of {{mvar|W}} &mdash; that is, the rejection of \"backward\" or \"retrograde\" secondary waves &mdash; is also explained by Fermat's principle. For example, in [[#Fig2|Fig.{{nnbsp}}2]], the traversal time of the path {{mvar|APP&prime;P}} (where the last leg \"doubles back\") is ''not'' stationary with respect to variation of {{mvar|P&prime;}}, but is maximally sensitive to movement of {{mvar|P&prime;}} along the leg {{mvar|PP&prime;}}.</ref>\n\nThrough this equivalence, Fermat's principle sustains Huygens' construction and thence all the conclusions that Huygens was able to draw from that construction. In short, \"The laws of geometrical optics may be derived from Fermat's principle\".<ref>The quote is from [[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], p.{{nnbsp}}740.</ref> With the exception of the Fermat-Huygens principle itself, these laws are special cases in the sense that they depend on further assumptions about the media. Two of them are mentioned under the next heading.\n\n== Special cases ==\n\n=== Isotropic media: Rays normal to wavefronts ===\n\nIn an isotropic medium, because the propagation speed is independent of direction, the secondary wavefronts that expand from points on a primary wavefront in a given ''infinitesimal'' time are spherical,<ref name=\"De Witte, 1959\" /> so that their radii are normal to their common tangent surface at the points of tangency. But their radii mark the ray directions, and their common tangent surface is a general wavefront. Thus the rays are normal (orthogonal) to the wavefronts.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}295, col.{{nnbsp}}1.</ref>\n\nBecause much of the teaching of optics concentrates on isotropic media, treating anisotropic media as an optional topic, the assumption that the rays are normal to the wavefronts can become so pervasive that even Fermat's principle is explained under that assumption,<ref>This occurs in [[#BW|Born & Wolf, 1970]], pp.{{nnbsp}}128\u201330, and persists in later editions.</ref> although in fact Fermat's principle is more general.\n\n=== Homogeneous media: Rectilinear propagation ===\n\nIn a homogeneous medium (also called a ''uniform'' medium), all the secondary wavefronts that expand from a given primary wavefront {{mvar|W}} in a given time {{mvar|&Delta;t}} are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] and similarly oriented, so that their envelope {{mvar|W&prime;}} may be considered as the envelope of a ''single'' secondary wavefront which preserves its orientation while its center (source) moves over {{mvar|W}}. If {{mvar|P}} is its center while {{mvar|P&prime;}} is its point of tangency with {{mvar|W&prime;}}, then {{mvar|P&prime;}} moves parallel to {{mvar|P}}, so that the plane tangential to {{mvar|W&prime;}} at {{mvar|P&prime;}} is parallel to the plane tangential to {{mvar|W}} at {{mvar|P}}. Let another (congruent and similarly orientated) secondary wavefront be centered on {{mvar|P&prime;}}, moving with {{mvar|P}}, and let it meet its envelope {{mvar|W&Prime;}} at point {{mvar|P&Prime;}}. Then, by the same reasoning, the plane tangential to {{mvar|W&Prime;}} at {{mvar|P&Prime;}} is parallel to the other two planes. Hence, due to the congruence and similar orientations, the ray directions {{mvar|PP&prime;}} and {{mvar|P&prime;P&Prime;}} are the same (but not necessarily normal to the wavefronts, since the secondary wavefronts are not necessarily spherical). This construction can be repeated any number of times, giving a straight ray of any length. Thus a homogeneous medium admits rectilinear rays.<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]] (p.{{nnbsp}}295, col.{{nnbsp}}1 and Figure&nbsp;2), states the result and condenses the explanation into one diagram.</ref>\n\n== Modern version ==\n\n=== Formulation in terms of refractive index ===\n\nLet a path {{math|&Gamma;}} extend from point {{mvar|A}} to point {{mvar|B}}.

[[Hero of Alexandria]], in his ''[[Catoptrics]]'' (1st century CE), showed that the ordinary [[specular reflection|law of reflection]] off a plane surface follows from the premise that the total ''length'' of the ray path is a minimum.<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}69\u201371. As the author notes, the law of reflection itself is found in Proposition&nbsp;{{serif|XIX}} of [[Euclid's Optics|Euclid's ''Optics'']].</ref> In 1657, [[Pierre de Fermat]] received from [[Marin Cureau de la Chambre]] a copy of newly published treatise, in which La&nbsp;Chambre noted Hero's principle and complained that it did not work for refraction.<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}137\u20139; [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], p.{{nnbsp}}48.</ref>\n\nFermat replied that refraction might be brought into the same framework by supposing that light took the path of least ''resistance'', and that different media offered different resistances. His eventual solution, described in a letter to La&nbsp;Chambre dated 1&nbsp;January 1662, construed \"resistance\" as inversely proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least ''time''. That premise yielded the [[Snell's law|ordinary law of refraction]], provided that light traveled more slowly in the optically denser medium.<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}139,{{px2}}143\u20137; [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}48\u20139 (where, in footnote&nbsp;21, \"Descartes\" obviously should be \"Fermat\").</ref><ref group=Note>[[Ibn al-Haytham]], writing in [[Cairo]] in the 2nd decade of the 11th century, also believed that light took the path of least resistance and that denser media offered more resistance, but he retained a more conventional notion of \"resistance\". If this notion was to explain refraction, it required the resistance to vary with direction in a manner that was hard to reconcile with reflection. Meanwhile [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn&nbsp;Sahl]] had already arrived at the correct law of refraction by a different method; but his law was not propagated&nbsp;([[#Mihas06|Mihas, 2006]], pp.{{nnbsp}}761\u20135; [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}20\u201321,{{px2}}41).<br/>The problem solved by Fermat is mathematically equivalent to the following: given two points in different media with different densities, minimize the ''density-weighted'' length of the path between the two points. In [[Leuven|Louvain]], in 1634 (by which time [[Willebrord Snellius]] had rediscovered Ibn Sahl's law, and Descartes had derived it but not yet published it), the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] professor Wilhelm Boelmans gave a correct solution to this problem, and set its proof as an exercise for his Jesuit students&nbsp;([[#Zigg80|Ziggelaar, 1980]]).</ref>\n\nFermat's solution was a landmark in that it unified the then-known laws of geometrical optics under a ''[[variational principle]]'' or ''[[action (physics)|action principle]]'', setting the precedent for the [[principle of least action]] in classical mechanics and the corresponding principles in other fields (see ''[[History of variational principles in physics]]'').<ref>[[#Chaves16|Chaves, 2016]], chapters 14,{{tsp}}19.</ref> It was the more notable because it used the method of ''[[adequality]]'', which may be understood in retrospect as finding the point where the slope of an infinitesimally short [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is zero,<ref>[[#Sabra81|Sabra, 1981]], pp.{{nnbsp}}144\u20135.</ref> without the intermediate step of finding a general expression for the slope (the [[derivative]]).\n\nIt was also immediately controversial. The ordinary law of refraction was at that time attributed to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (d.{{nnbsp}}1650), who had tried to explain it by supposing that light was a force that propagated ''instantaneously'', or that light was analogous to a tennis ball that traveled ''faster'' in the denser medium,{{r|schuster-2000-261}}<ref>[[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}41\u20132.</ref> either premise being inconsistent with Fermat's.&nbsp; Descartes' most prominent defender, [[Claude Clerselier]], criticized Fermat for apparently ascribing knowledge and intent to nature, and for failing to explain why nature should prefer to economize on time rather than distance. Clerselier wrote in part:\n<blockquote>\n1. The principle that you take as the basis of your demonstration, namely that nature always acts in the shortest and simplest ways, is merely a moral principle and not a physical one; it is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in nature.... For otherwise we would attribute knowledge to nature; but here, by \"nature\", we understand only this order and this law established in the world as it is, which acts without foresight, without choice, and by a necessary determination.\n\n2. This same principle would make nature irresolute... For I ask you... when a ray of light must pass from a point in a rare medium to a point in a dense one, is there not reason for nature to hesitate if, by your principle, it must choose the straight line as soon as the bent one, since if the latter proves shorter in time, the former is shorter and simpler in length? Who will decide and who will pronounce?{{nnbsp}}{{r|clerselier-1662}}\n</blockquote>\n\nFermat, being unaware of the mechanistic foundations of his own principle, was not well placed to defend it, except as a purely geometric and [[kinematics|kinematic]] proposition.{{r|smith-1959-651n|fermat-1662-clerselier}}&nbsp; The [[wave theory of light]], first proposed by [[Robert Hooke]] in the year of Fermat's death,<ref>[[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], p.{{nnbsp}}53.</ref> and rapidly improved by [[Ignace-Gaston Pardies]]<ref>[[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}60\u201364.</ref> and (especially) [[Christiaan Huygens]],<ref>[[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], pp.{{nnbsp}}64\u201371; [[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]].</ref> contained the necessary foundations; but the recognition of this fact was surprisingly slow.\n\n=== Huygens's oversight ===\n\n[[File:Christiaan-huygens4.jpg|left|thumb|Christiaan Huygens {{nowrap|(1629\u20131695)}}]]\n\nHuygens repeatedly referred to the envelope of his secondary wavefronts as the ''termination'' of the movement,<ref>[[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]], pp.{{nnbsp}}20,{{hsp}}24,{{hsp}}37,{{hsp}}51,{{hsp}}80,{{hsp}}108,{{hsp}}119,{{hsp}}122 (with various inflections of the word).</ref> meaning that the later wavefront was the outer boundary that the disturbance could reach in a given time,<ref>[[#ToL|Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson]], top of p.{{nnbsp}}20.</ref> which was therefore the minimum time in which each point on the later wavefront could be reached.

The corpuscular speed that satisfied this principle was proportional to the reciprocal of the ray speed given by the radius of Huygens' spheroid. Laplace continued:\n<blockquote>\nAccording to Huygens, the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in the crystal, is simply expressed by the radius of the spheroid; consequently his hypothesis ''does not agree'' with the principle of the least action: but ''it is remarkable'' that it agrees with the principle of Fermat, which is, that light passes, from a given point without the crystal, to a given point within it, in the least possible time; for it is easy to see that this principle coincides with that of the least action, if we invert the expression of the velocity.<ref>Translated by [[#Young1809|Young (1809)]], p.{{nnbsp}}341; Young's italics.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|left|thumb|Thomas Young {{nowrap|(1773\u20131829)}}]]\n\nLaplace's report was the subject of a wide-ranging rebuttal by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], who wrote in part:\n<blockquote>\nThe principle of Fermat, although it was assumed by that mathematician on hypothetical, or even imaginary grounds, is in fact a fundamental law with respect to undulatory motion, and is {{sic|explicitly}} the basis of every determination in the Huygenian theory...&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Laplace seems to be unacquainted with this most essential principle of one of the two theories which he compares; for he says, that \"it is remarkable,\" that the Huygenian law of extraordinary refraction agrees with the principle of Fermat; which he would scarcely have observed, if he had been aware that the law was an immediate consequence of the principle.<ref>[[#Young1809|Young, 1809]], p.{{nnbsp}}342.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn fact Laplace ''was'' aware that Fermat's principle follows from Huygens' construction in the case of refraction from an isotropic medium to an anisotropic one; a geometric proof was contained in the long version of Laplace's report, printed in 1810.<ref>On the proof, see [[#Darr12|Darrigol, 2012]], p.{{nnbsp}}190.

Unfortunately, however, the omitted middle sentence of the quoted paragraph by Young began \"The motion of every undulation must necessarily be in a direction ''perpendicular'' to its surface...\" (emphasis added), and was therefore bound to sow confusion rather than clarity.\n\n[[File:Augustin Fresnel.jpg|thumb|Augustin-Jean Fresnel {{nowrap|(1788\u20131827)}}]]\n\nNo such confusion subsists in [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s \"Second Memoir\" on double refraction ([[#SecMem|Fresnel,&nbsp;1827]]), which addresses Fermat's principle in several places (without naming Fermat), proceeding from the special case in which rays are normal to wavefronts, to the general case in which rays are paths of least time or stationary time. (In the following summary, page numbers refer to [[#SecMem|Alfred W.{{tsp}}Hobson's translation]].)\n* For refraction of a plane wave at parallel incidence on one face of an anisotropic crystalline wedge (pp.{{nnbsp}}291\u20132), in order to find the \"first ray arrived\" at an observation point beyond the other face of the wedge, it suffices to treat the rays outside the crystal as normal to the wavefronts, and within the crystal to consider only the parallel wavefronts (whatever the ray direction). So in this case, Fresnel does not attempt to trace the complete ray path.<ref group=Note>In the translation, some lines and symbols are missing from the diagram; the corrected diagram may be found in Fresnel's ''Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes'', vol.{{nnbsp}}2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g6tzUG7JmoQC&pg=PA547 p.{{nnbsp}}547].</ref>\n\n* Next, Fresnel considers a ray refracted from a point-source ''M'' inside a crystal, through a point ''A'' on the surface, to an observation point ''B'' outside (pp.{{nnbsp}}294\u20136). The surface passing through ''B'' and given by the \"locus of the disturbances which arrive first\" is, according to Huygens' construction, normal to \"the ray ''AB'' of swiftest arrival\". But this construction requires knowledge of the \"surface of the wave\" (that is, the secondary wavefront) within the crystal.\n\n* Then he considers a plane wavefront propagating in a medium with non-spherical secondary wavefronts, oriented so that the ray path given by Huygens' construction &mdash; from the source of the secondary wavefront to its point of tangency with the subsequent primary wavefront &mdash; is ''not'' normal to the primary wavefronts (p.{{nnbsp}}296). He shows that this path is nevertheless \"the path of quickest arrival of the disturbance\" from the earlier primary wavefront to the point of tangency.\n\n* In a later heading (p.{{nnbsp}}305) he declares that \"The construction of Huygens, which determines the path of swiftest arrival,\" is applicable to secondary wavefronts of any shape. He then notes that when we apply Huygens' construction to refraction into a crystal with a two-sheeted secondary wavefront, and draw the lines from the two points of tangency to the center of the secondary wavefront, \"we shall have the directions of the two paths of swiftest arrival, and consequently of the ordinary and of the extraordinary ray.\"\n\n* Under the heading \"Definition of the word ''Ray''\" (p.{{nnbsp}}309), he concludes that this term must be applied to the line which joins the center of the secondary wave to a point on its surface, whatever the inclination of this line to the surface.\n\n* As a \"new consideration\" (pp.{{nnbsp}}310\u201311), he notes that if a plane wavefront is passed through a small hole centered on point ''E'', then the direction ''ED'' of maximum intensity of the resulting beam will be that in which the secondary wave starting from ''E'' will \"arrive there the first\", and the secondary wavefronts from opposite sides of the hole (equidistant from ''E'') will \"arrive at ''D'' in the same time\" as each other. This direction is ''not'' assumed to be normal to any wavefront.\nThus Fresnel showed, even for anisotropic media, that the ray path given by Huygens' construction is the path of least time between successive positions of a plane or diverging wavefront, that the ray velocities are the radii of the secondary \"wave surface\" after unit time, and that a stationary traversal time accounts for the direction of maximum intensity of a beam. However, establishing the general equivalence between Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle would have required further consideration of Fermat's principle in point-to-point terms.\n\n{{vpad|1=1ex}}\n\nAccording to [[#deWitte|Adriaan J.&nbsp;de Witte (1959)]], the equivalence of Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle was discussed by [[Hendrik Lorentz]] in 1907.{{r|lorentz-1907}} De&nbsp;Witte offers his own proof, which \"although in essence the same, is believed to be more cogent and more general.\" But, he notes, \"The matter seems to have escaped treatment in textbooks.\"<ref>[[#deWitte|De Witte, 1959]], p.{{nnbsp}}293n.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Action (physics)]]\n* [[Adequality]]\n* [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]\n* [[Birefringence]]\n* [[Calculus of variations]]\n* [[Eikonal equation]]\n* [[Fermat\u2019s and energy variation principles in field theory]]\n* [[Geodesic]]\n* [[Hamilton's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Path integral formulation]]\n* [[Pierre de Fermat]]\n* [[Principle of least action]]\n* [[Snell's law]]\n* [[Thomas Young (scientist)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=vanHouten-beenakker-1995-272>H. van Houten and C.W.J.&nbsp;Beenakker, 1995, [http://lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/beenakkr/mesoscopics/fulltext/172_108_Burstein.pdf \"Principles of solid state electron optics\"],{{tsp}} in{{tsp}} E.&nbsp;Burstein and C.&nbsp;Weisbuch (eds.), ''Confined Electrons and Photons: New Physics and Applications'' (NATO ASI Series; Series&nbsp;B: Physics, vol.{{nnbsp}}340), Boston, MA: Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4615-1963-8}}, {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}269\u2013303}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4615-1963-8_9}}, at {{nowrap|pp.{{tsp}}272\u20133}}.</ref>\n\n<ref name=clerselier-1662>Clerselier to Fermat (in&nbsp;French), 6&nbsp;May 1662,{{tsp}} in{{tsp}} P.{{nnbsp}}Tannery and C.{{nnbsp}}Henry (eds.), ''\u0152uvres de Fermat'', vol.{{nnbsp}}2 (Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1894), [https://archive.org/stream/oeuvresdefermat02ferm/#page/464 pp.{{nnbsp}}464\u201372].</ref>\n\n<ref name=fermat-1662-clerselier>Fermat to Clerselier (in&nbsp;French), 21&nbsp;May 1662,{{tsp}} in{{tsp}} P.{{nnbsp}}Tannery and C.{{nnbsp}}Henry (eds.), ''\u0152uvres de Fermat'', vol.{{nnbsp}}2 (Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1894), [https://archive.org/stream/oeuvresdefermat02ferm/#page/482 pp.{{nnbsp}}482\u20134].</ref>\n\n<ref name=feynman-1988-51>R.P.

It is located {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]].

This gate provided access to the river.\"]]\nPrior to [[History of Canada|colonization]], the area around what is now Fort Saskatchewan was a gathering place and home to a variety of different [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous]] nations, including the [[Cree|Cree (N\u00e9hinaw)]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Nakota]] nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskatchewanrecord.com/news/local-news/here-is-a-sneak-peek|title=Here is a sneak peek|last=January 31|first=Arthur Green Published on:|last2=January 31|first2=2019 {{!}} Last Updated:|date=2019-01-31|website=Fort Saskatchewan Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=Est|first3=2019 4:20 Pm}}</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the region commonly traveled the North Saskatchewan River by [[Canoe]].

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison. The community was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1899, a [[town]] in 1904, and a [[city]] in 1985.<ref name=\"AMACityProfiles\" /> \n\n==== The hanging of Swift Runner ====\nOn December 20 1879, Fort Saskatchewan's police garrison conducted the first hanging in the Northwest Territories - an area that includes present-day Alberta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/hanged/swiftrunner.html|title=Hanged: A special series about the history of capital punishment in Alberta|website=www.edmontonjournal.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Swift Runner (Ka-Ki-Si-Kutchin), a Cree man, was considered by locals to be smart and trustworthy, and previously served as a guide for local police. However, he was expelled from Fort Saskatchewan, and later his tribe as well, after developing a severe addiction to Whisky. After he eventually arrived back at Fort Saskatchewan alone, it was  discovered that he had killed and eaten his six children, his wife, his brother, and his mother. Possible motives for his acts have been proposed, such as trauma from previously being forced to eat a deceased hunting partner out of necessity, or being possessed by [[Wendigo]] - a flesh eating spirit in some Indigenous cultures. \n\nIn August 1879, after being charged for murder and cannibalism, Swift Runner was sentenced to death by a jury consisting of three M\u00e9tis residents, four locals who knew the Cree language, and a Cree translator. Scaffolding was built for his hanging in December, and an [[Canadian Army|Army]] pensioner was paid $50 to act as the hangman. Local Indigenous chiefs were also invited to observe the execution to pacify rumours of unnecessary cruelty inflicted upon the condemned.  However, the hanging had to be delayed after locals used the trap from the scaffolding as kindling for a fire, and the hangman forgot straps to bind Swift Runner's arms. At 9:30 AM, Swift Runner was hanged in front of 60 onlookers and pronounced dead shortly after. Within an hour, his body was cut from the rope and buried in the snow outside of the fort walls.\n=== Arrival of the railway ===\n[[File:CNR Station Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=CN Station in Fort Saskatchewan.|left|thumb|300px|Historic [[Fort Saskatchewan station|Fort Saskatchewan railway station]]]]\nPrior to the arrival of the railway, people travelling to and from Edmonton had to traverse a dirt trail that wound around woods and swamps.<ref name=\":1\" /> The [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (C.N.R.) reached Fort Saskatchewan in 1905, placing the town on a transcontinental rail line.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=337}}</ref> The [[Fort Saskatchewan station|C.N.R. station]] is a modified third class station design (100-19 plan), which is a \"special station\" that was only used by C.N.R. at the most significant stops along their line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Details.aspx?DeptID=1&ObjectID=4665-0701|title=Alberta Register of Historic Places|website=hermis.alberta.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> It is longer than other third class stations built by C.N.R. and has several unique features, including hip roofs on either side of the building, and a large interior that contains a vestibule, a kitchen, a living room, a large general waiting room, a separate waiting room for women, an office, and a small freight shed. An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

It is located {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison. The community was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1899, a [[town]] in 1904, and a [[city]] in 1985.<ref name=\"AMACityProfiles\" /> \n\n==== The hanging of Swift Runner ====\nOn December 20 1879, Fort Saskatchewan's police garrison conducted the first hanging in the Northwest Territories - an area that includes present-day Alberta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/hanged/swiftrunner.html|title=Hanged: A special series about the history of capital punishment in Alberta|website=www.edmontonjournal.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Swift Runner (Ka-Ki-Si-Kutchin), a Cree man, was considered by locals to be smart and trustworthy, and previously served as a guide for local police. However, he was expelled from Fort Saskatchewan, and later his tribe as well, after developing a severe addiction to Whisky. After he eventually arrived back at Fort Saskatchewan alone, it was  discovered that he had killed and eaten his six children, his wife, his brother, and his mother. Possible motives for his acts have been proposed, such as trauma from previously being forced to eat a deceased hunting partner out of necessity, or being possessed by [[Wendigo]] - a flesh eating spirit in some Indigenous cultures. \n\nIn August 1879, after being charged for murder and cannibalism, Swift Runner was sentenced to death by a jury consisting of three M\u00e9tis residents, four locals who knew the Cree language, and a Cree translator. Scaffolding was built for his hanging in December, and an [[Canadian Army|Army]] pensioner was paid $50 to act as the hangman. Local Indigenous chiefs were also invited to observe the execution to pacify rumours of unnecessary cruelty inflicted upon the condemned.  However, the hanging had to be delayed after locals used the trap from the scaffolding as kindling for a fire, and the hangman forgot straps to bind Swift Runner's arms. At 9:30 AM, Swift Runner was hanged in front of 60 onlookers and pronounced dead shortly after.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.
