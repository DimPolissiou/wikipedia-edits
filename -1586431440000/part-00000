Each year all clubs in the division also take part in the [[RFU Intermediate Cup]] - a level 7 national competition.\n\nThe division was formed for the 2000-01 when the old Midlands 3 East was split into two regional divisions called [[Midlands 3 East (North)]] and [[Midlands 3 East (South)]] and gained its current title for the 2009\u201310 season due to further restructuring to the Midlands League. Promoted teams tend to move up to [[Midlands 1 East]] with the champions going up automatically and the runners up having to play a playoff against the runners up from [[Midlands 2 East (North)]] for their place. Demoted teams typically drop to [[Midlands 3 East (South)]].\n\n==2019\u201320==\n\n===Participating teams & locations===\n\n{{col-begin|width=100%}}\n{{col-break|width=70%}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Each year all clubs in the division also take part in the [[RFU Intermediate Cup]] - a level 7 national competition. \n\nThe division was formed for the 2000-01 when the old Midlands 3 East was split into two regional divisions called [[Midlands 3 East (North)]] and [[Midlands 3 East (South)]] and gained its current title for the 2009-10 season due to further restructuring to the Midlands League. Promoted teams tend to move up to [[Midlands 1 East]] with the champions going up automatically and the runners up having to play a playoff against the runners up from [[Midlands 2 East (North)]] for their place. Demoted teams typically drop to [[Midlands 3 East (South)]].\n\n==2019\u201320==\n\n===Participating teams & locations===\n\n{{col-begin|width=100%}}\n{{col-break|width=70%}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Their traditional lifestyle was that of fishers along this coastal strip and around the river mouths, islands and seas between the Barron River and Port Douglas\n\n==Language==\nThe Irukandji spoke ''[[Yirrgay language|Yirrgay]]'', one of the five dialects of the language group generally known as [[Djabugay language|Djabugay]].{{efn|The other three were Bulway, Guluy, and Njagali.{{sfn|Dixon|2002|p=xxxii}} }} These dialects indicate that Djabugay was genetically related to [[Yidiny language|Yidiny]], with a lexical overlap of 53%.{{sfn|Dixon|1977|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n==Country==\nIrukandji country, according to [[Norman Tindale]], extended over some {{convert|200|mi2|km2}}, running along the narrow coastal strip from Cairns to the Mowbray River at Port Douglas. Their inland extension went some 7&nbsp;miles northwest of Cairns, around the tidal waters of the [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] around [[Redlynch, Queensland|Redlynch]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=169}} Dialects defined tribal distinctions, and the Irukandji dialect Yirrgay, was the southernmost of the group, with the [[Yidinji people]] to their immediate south, while, northwards, one encountered, in geographic order, Guluy, Ngakali and finally Djabugay. The Bulway-speakers lay to their west, from [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] to [[Mareeba]].{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=5}}{{efn|Writing in 1939 [[Ursula McConnel]], stated the order:'South of Port Douglas is another group \u2013 the indyi or andyi tribes of Mowbray, Barron and Mulgrave Rivers, surveyed originally by Roth and later by me in 1931. On the Mowbray River are the [[Djabugai|Tyabogai-tyanyi]], a branch of whom on the Barron River are known as the Nyakali. On the south side of the Barron River are the Bulwandyi; low down on the Barron River are the Yirkandyi.'{{sfn|McConnel|1939|p=67}} }}\n\n==History==\nThe Irukandji as a distinct tribal identity were close to extinction by the end of the 19th century. [[William Parry-Okeden]], in a short report on Queensland aborigines written in his capacity as [[Queensland Police Service|Police Commissioner]], wrote in 1897{{sfn|Parry-Okeden|1897}} that he counted 6 ''Yettkie'', a name now thought to refer to a remnant of the Irukandji.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=169}} The following year Billy Jagar, leader of the Irukandji, received a [[King plate]], designating him as 'King of Barron', a gesture repeated in 1906 with a second plate bearing the same inscription. Jagar died at the age of 60 in 1930 in his traditional [[Gunyah|''payu'']] hut at the northern end of the Cairns Esplanade.{{sfn|Cairns Post|1930|p=4}} Writing in 1974 Tindale stated:\n<blockquote>'The term Irukandji for the people on the coast near Redlynch in the area around Cairns has been in dispute because of their early demise as a tribe. By 1952 remembrance of their existence had almost died out and a mixed Tjapukai and [[Mamu people|Mamu]] group, from higher up the Barron River, and from the south had usurped their territory. They call themselves the Djumbandji. The coastal Irukandji were said to have been a taller people than the rain forest dwellers. In 1964 Jack Doolan questioned several informants, none from the Cairns area, who believed the Irukandji did not exist. They based their ideas on information that ''irukandji'' meant \u201cfrom the north.\u201d They suggested that if a  [[Girramay|Keramai (Giramai)]]  or a Mamu was questioned about the country from which a northern stranger might have come he  would simply refer to him as an Irukandji, that is, a \u201cnortherner.\u201d In similar fashion he might refer to a man from the west as ''gambilbara'', a rain forest man, or from the east as a ''djindigal'' (Jindigal).' {{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=123}}</blockquote>\n\n==Modern times==\nIn recent times there have been clashes in claims advanced respectively by the Yirrganydji Aboriginal Tribal Corporation (''Dawul Wuru Aboriginal Corporation'') and the Djabugay Aboriginal Tribal Corporation, the former insisting that any development projects by the Djabugay in the historic territories of their Irukandji forebears, require their consent and participation.{{sfn|Henry|2012|p=201}}\n\nThe [[Irukandji jellyfish]] are named after Irrukandji country.\n\n==Alternative names==\n* ''Irakanji, Yirkandji, Yirkanji.''\n* ''Yirgay.''\n* ''Yettkie.''

Their traditional lifestyle was that of fishers along this coastal strip and around the river mouths, islands and seas between the Barron River and Port Douglas\n\n==Language==\nThe Irukandji spoke ''[[Yirrgay language|Yirrgay]]'', one of the five dialects of the language group generally known as [[Djabugay language|Djabugay]].{{efn|The other three were Bulway, Guluy, and Njagali.{{sfn|Dixon|2002|p=xxxii}} }} These dialects indicate that Djabugay was genetically related to [[Yidiny language|Yidiny]], with a lexical overlap of 53%.{{sfn|Dixon|1977|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n==Country==\nIrukandji country, according to [[Norman Tindale]], extended over some {{convert|200|mi2|km2}}, running along the narrow coastal strip from Cairns to the Mowbray River at Port Douglas. Their inland extension went some 7&nbsp;miles northwest of Cairns, around the tidal waters of the [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] around [[Redlynch, Queensland|Redlynch]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=169}} Dialects defined tribal distinctions, and the Irukandji dialect Yirrgay, was the southernmost of the group, with the [[Yidinji people]] to their immediate south, while, northwards, one encountered, in geographic order, Guluy, Ngakali and finally Djabugay. The Bulway-speakers lay to their west, from [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] to [[Mareeba]].{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=5}}{{efn|Writing in 1939 [[Ursula McConnel]], stated the order:'South of Port Douglas is another group \u2013 the indyi or andyi tribes of Mowbray, Barron and Mulgrave Rivers, surveyed originally by Roth and later by me in 1931. On the Mowbray River are the [[Djabugai|Tyabogai-tyanyi]], a branch of whom on the Barron River are known as the Nyakali. On the south side of the Barron River are the Bulwandyi; low down on the Barron River are the Yirkandyi.'{{sfn|McConnel|1939|p=67}} }}\n\n==History==\nThe Irukandji as a distinct tribal identity were close to extinction by the end of the 19th century. [[William Parry-Okeden]], in a short report on Queensland aborigines written in his capacity as [[Queensland Police Service|Police Commissioner]], wrote in 1897{{sfn|Parry-Okeden|1897}} that he counted 6 ''Yettkie'', a name now thought to refer to a remnant of the Irukandji.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=169}} The following year Billy Jagar, leader of the Irukandji, received a [[King plate]], designating him as 'King of Barron', a gesture repeated in 1906 with a second plate bearing the same inscription. Jagar died at the age of 60 in 1930 in his traditional [[Gunyah|''payu'']] hut at the northern end of the Cairns Esplanade.{{sfn|Cairns Post|1930|p=4}} Writing in 1974 Tindale stated:\n<blockquote>'The term Irukandji for the people on the coast near Redlynch in the area around Cairns has been in dispute because of their early demise as a tribe. By 1952 remembrance of their existence had almost died out and a mixed Tjapukai and [[Mamu]] group, from higher up the Barron River, and from the south had usurped their territory. They call themselves the Djumbandji. The coastal Irukandji were said to have been a taller people than the rain forest dwellers. In 1964 Jack Doolan questioned several informants, none from the Cairns area, who believed the Irukandji did not exist. They based their ideas on information that ''irukandji'' meant \u201cfrom the north.\u201d They suggested that if a  [[Girramay|Keramai (Giramai)]]  or a Mamu was questioned about the country from which a northern stranger might have come he  would simply refer to him as an Irukandji, that is, a \u201cnortherner.\u201d In similar fashion he might refer to a man from the west as ''gambilbara'', a rain forest man, or from the east as a ''djindigal'' (Jindigal).' {{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=123}}</blockquote>\n\n==Modern times==\nIn recent times there have been clashes in claims advanced respectively by the Yirrganydji Aboriginal Tribal Corporation (''Dawul Wuru Aboriginal Corporation'') and the Djabugay Aboriginal Tribal Corporation, the former insisting that any development projects by the Djabugay in the historic territories of their Irukandji forebears, require their consent and participation.{{sfn|Henry|2012|p=201}}\n\nThe [[Irukandji jellyfish]] are named after Irrukandji country.\n\n==Alternative names==\n* ''Irakanji, Yirkandji, Yirkanji.''\n* ''Yirgay.''\n* ''Yettkie.''

Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme|enzymes]], structural proteins or [[hormone|hormones]] and therefore, are crucial biological components.

Protein synthesis is very similar for [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a [[gene]] (section of [[DNA]]) is converted into a template molecule ([[messenger RNA]]) by enzymes, known as [[RNA polymerases]], in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. This mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore|nuclear pores]] to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. Subsequently during translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome|ribosomes]] in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid|amino acids]]. The amino acids are joined together by [[peptide bond|peptide bonds]] (a type of [[covalent bond]]) to form a polypeptide chain. \n\nFollowing translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide chain, this polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein i.e. fold to produce the functional [[active site]] of the enzyme. The incorrect folding of polypeptide chains can result in non-functional proteins, this is often caused by [[mutations]] in the underlying DNA [[nucleotide]] sequence.

In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain.

The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react.

This mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore|nuclear pores]] to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. Subsequently during translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome|ribosomes]] in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid|amino acids]]. The amino acids are joined together by [[peptide bond|peptide bonds]] (a type of [[covalent bond]]) to form a polypeptide chain. \n\nFollowing translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide chain, this polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein i.e. fold to produce the functional [[active site]] of the enzyme. The incorrect folding of polypeptide chains can result in non-functional proteins, this is often caused by [[mutations]] in the underlying DNA [[nucleotide]] sequence. These mutations in the DNA change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then changes the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain. These mutations can cause the mRNA sequence to be shorter due to [[stop codon|earlier termination of transcription]], thereby, producing a shorter polypeptide chain.

In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of single nucleotides by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand, behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[Peptidyl transferase|peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=Sixth}}</ref>.\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed [[intramolecular|either within the protein]] or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerase. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=Sixth}}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removal of internal link to wrong wikipedia page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}
