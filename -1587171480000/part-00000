Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected people such as recurrences of [[seasonal influenza]] are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide.\n\nThroughout history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]] (also known as The Plague), which killed an estimated 75\u2013200 million people in the 14th century.

During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the \"mere\" destruction of cities:\n* [[Plague of Athens]] (430 to 426 BCE) - During the [[Peloponnesian War]], [[Typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&ref=sciam&chanID=sa003 \"Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid\"].

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

The rivalry began as an in-conference rivalry within the [[Ohio Valley Conference]], but the Hilltoppers have since moved to the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]], first to the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and most recently to [[Conference USA]]. The rivalry has continued as a trophy game, although it is no longer played on an annual basis.\n\n==History==\nThe football rivalry between the Hilltoppers and the Racers dates to 1931. Western Kentucky secured a victory in the first game on October 24, 1931. In 1939, both institutions strengthened the rivalry by scheduling the match up as the final game of their regular seasons. This tradition continued, with only four interruptions, for the next 46 years.\n\nPrior to the 1955 football game, a group of Western Kentucky students traveled to Murray and stole a banner commemorating Murray State's participation in the 1949 [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u201382)|Tangerine Bowl]]. In response, a group of Murray State students traveled to Bowling Green with buckets of paint and plans to paint the Western Kentucky water tower that overlooked the football stadium. The plan was stopped when the Murray State students were forced off the water tower by a group Western Kentucky students with an ROTC training rifle. A \"W\" was shaved into the hair of three of the Murray State students, and their photo appeared in the local newspaper along with a photo of the Western Kentucky students displaying their stolen Murray State Tangerine Bowl banner. Murray State won the 1955 game 28\u201312, and the Tangerine Bowl banner was returned to Murray State. Following the Racer victory, a similar banner was stolen from Western Kentucky's W Club room. Over the next decade, the water tower and statue of Henry Hardin Cherry remained targets of Murray State students any time the schools met in both football and basketball. In another incident, the phrase \"Murray OVC Champs\" was painted on an overpass near the Western Kentucky campus.<ref>Niedermeier, Lynn. ''\"Our Chief Rival and Greatest Friend\": The Western-Murray Athletic Rivalry''. 2009</ref>\n\nThe football rivalry was cemented as an annual trophy game in 1978 known as the Battle for the Red Belt. The Red Belt originated in 1978 when WKU athletic trainer Bill Edwards attended a district trainers' meeting in Atlanta with Murray State trainer Tom Simmons. Simmons forgot to bring a belt, and borrowed a red one from Edwards. After the meeting, Edwards asked for the return of his belt, but Simmons responded that WKU would have to battle Murray State in football to get it back. Simmons had the belt mounted on a large plaque with brass plates to record the annual game scores of the annual rivalry game. The annual meetings between the two teams ended in 2000, but the Battle for the Red Belt is still played on in intermittent basis. The last game was played in 2008 when a record crowd of 22,297 in Bowling Green watched the Hilltoppers beat the Racers 50\u20139 and maintain possession of the Red Belt. The Racers and Hilltoppers have met 67 times in football, with Western Kentucky leading the series 36\u201324\u20137.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbko.com/sports/headlines/28727884.html

Following the 2000 season, the Hilltoppers left the OVC as a result of a new OVC rule that required all eligible sports to participate in the conference. WKU was a football-only member of the OVC, and the university was not willing to move its other athletic programs back to the conference. Following the announcement, the head football coaches from both programs expressed the strong desire to keep the rivalry game on the schedule as an annual non-conference event.\n\n===2002===\nIn 2002, WKU and Murray State met in the first round of the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs.

This was the first meeting between the two programs since WKU left the OVC to move to the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference|Gateway Football Conference]].

The rivalry began as an in-conference rivalry within the [[Ohio Valley Conference]], but the Hilltoppers have since moved to the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]], first to the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and most recently to [[Conference USA]]. The rivalry has continued as a trophy game, although it is no longer played on an annual basis.\n\n==History==\nThe football rivalry between the Hilltoppers and the Racers dates to 1931. Western Kentucky secured a victory in the first game on October 24, 1931. In 1939, both institutions strengthened the rivalry by scheduling the match up as the final game of their regular seasons. This tradition continued, with only four interruptions, for the next 46 years.\n\nPrior to the 1955 football game, a group of Western Kentucky students traveled to Murray and stole a banner commemorating Murray State's participation in the 1949 [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u201382)|Tangerine Bowl]]. In response, a group of Murray State students traveled to Bowling Green with buckets of paint and plans to paint the Western Kentucky water tower that overlooked the football stadium. The plan was stopped when the Murray State students were forced off the water tower by a group Western Kentucky students with an ROTC training rifle. A \"W\" was shaved into the hair of three of the Murray State students, and their photo appeared in the local newspaper along with a photo of the Western Kentucky students displaying their stolen Murray State Tangerine Bowl banner. Murray State won the 1955 game 28\u201312, and the Tangerine Bowl banner was returned to Murray State. Following the Racer victory, a similar banner was stolen from Western Kentucky's W Club room. Over the next decade, the water tower and statue of Henry Hardin Cherry remained targets of Murray State students any time the schools met in both football and basketball. In another incident, the phrase \"Murray OVC Champs\" was painted on an overpass near the Western Kentucky campus.<ref>Niedermeier, Lynn. ''\"Our Chief Rival and Greatest Friend\": The Western-Murray Athletic Rivalry''. 2009</ref>\n\nThe football rivalry was cemented as an annual trophy game in 1978 known as the Battle for the Red Belt. The Red Belt originated in 1978 when WKU athletic trainer Bill Edwards attended a district trainers' meeting in Atlanta with Murray State trainer Tom Simmons. Simmons forgot to bring a belt, and borrowed a red one from Edwards. After the meeting, Edwards asked for the return of his belt, but Simmons responded that WKU would have to battle Murray State in football to get it back. Simmons had the belt mounted on a large plaque with brass plates to record the annual game scores of the annual rivalry game. The annual meetings between the two teams ended in 2000, but the Battle for the Red Belt is still played on in intermittent basis. The last game was played in 2008 when a record crowd of 22,297 in Bowling Green watched the Hilltoppers beat the Racers 50\u20139 and maintain possession of the Red Belt. The Racers and Hilltoppers have met 67 times in football, with Western Kentucky leading the series 36\u201324\u20137.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbko.com/sports/headlines/28727884.html

The word ''slug'' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly [[Opisthobranchia|sea slug]]s and [[semislug]]s (this is in contrast to the common name ''[[snail]]'', which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).\n\nVarious [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] families of land slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, the various families of slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category \"slug\" is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] one.\nAlso a term used in club scene and streets for cocaine. \u201cGasping for a slug\u201d\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOf the six orders of [[Pulmonata]], two \u2013 the [[Onchidiacea]] and [[Soleolifera]] \u2013 solely comprise slugs.

The upper pair is [[light]] [[sensor|sensing]] and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. Both pairs are retractable.\n\n'''Mantle'''\nOn top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped ''[[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]],'' and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a [[respiratory]] opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the [[pneumostome]].\n\n'''Tail{{anchor|Keel}}'''\nThe part of a slug behind the mantle is called the 'tail'.\n\n'''Keel'''\nSome species of slugs, for example ''[[Tandonia budapestensis]]'', have a prominent ridge running over their back along the middle of the tail (sometimes along the whole tail, sometimes only the final part). This ridge is called a 'keel'.\n\n'''Foot'''\nThe bottom side of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of [[muscular contraction]] on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of [[mucus]] that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues.<ref name=biologists1>{{cite journal|last=Denny|first=M. W.|author2=Gosline, J.

They must generate protective mucus to survive. Many species are most active just after rain because of the moist ground. In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under [[tree bark]], fallen [[Trunk (botany)|logs]], rocks and man-made structures, such as [[Flowerpot|planters]], to help retain body moisture.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Like all other gastropods, they undergo [[torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] (a 180\u00b0 twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation\u2014but externally, the bodies of slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the [[pneumostome]], which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side.\n\nSlugs produce two types of [[mucus]]: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The \"slime trail\" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful.<ref name=illinois1>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=P|title=Slugs|url=http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/pastpest/199809g.html|website=Home, Yard & Garden Pest Newsletter|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> Some species of slug, such as ''[[Limax maximus]]'', secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Slug eggs and baby.jpg|thumb|''[[Deroceras]]'' juvenile with eggs of another (larger) slug species, most likely Arionidae]]\n[[File:Slugs Mating.jpg|thumb|left|Slugs, suspended by [[mucous]] thread and pad on wall.]] Slugs are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both female and male reproductive organs.<ref name=\"theoystersgarter1\">{{cite web |url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |title=Perverted cannibalistic hermaphrodites haunt the Pacific Northwest! \" The Oyster's Garter |publisher=Theoystersgarter.com |date=24 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413003808/http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |archivedate=13 April 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia.

The word ''slug'' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly [[Opisthobranchia|sea slug]]s and [[semislug]]s (this is in contrast to the common name ''[[snail]]'', which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).\n\nVarious [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] families of land slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, the various families of slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category \"slug\" is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] one.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOf the six orders of [[Pulmonata]], two \u2013 the [[Onchidiacea]] and [[Soleolifera]] \u2013 solely comprise slugs.

The upper pair is [[light]] [[sensor|sensing]] and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. Both pairs are retractable.\n\n'''Mantle'''\nOn top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped ''[[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]],'' and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a [[respiratory]] opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the [[pneumostome]].\n\n'''Tail{{anchor|Keel}}'''\nThe part of a slug behind the mantle is called the 'tail'.\n\n'''Keel'''\nSome species of slugs, for example ''[[Tandonia budapestensis]]'', have a prominent ridge running over their back along the middle of the tail (sometimes along the whole tail, sometimes only the final part). This ridge is called a 'keel'.\n\n'''Foot'''\nThe bottom side of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of [[muscular contraction]] on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of [[mucus]] that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues.<ref name=biologists1>{{cite journal|last=Denny|first=M. W.|author2=Gosline, J.

They must generate protective mucus to survive. Many species are most active just after rain because of the moist ground. In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under [[tree bark]], fallen [[Trunk (botany)|logs]], rocks and man-made structures, such as [[Flowerpot|planters]], to help retain body moisture.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Like all other gastropods, they undergo [[torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] (a 180\u00b0 twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation\u2014but externally, the bodies of slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the [[pneumostome]], which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side.\n\nSlugs produce two types of [[mucus]]: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The \"slime trail\" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful.<ref name=illinois1>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=P|title=Slugs|url=http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/pastpest/199809g.html|website=Home, Yard & Garden Pest Newsletter|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> Some species of slug, such as ''[[Limax maximus]]'', secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Slug eggs and baby.jpg|thumb|''[[Deroceras]]'' juvenile with eggs of another (larger) slug species, most likely Arionidae]]\n[[File:Slugs Mating.jpg|thumb|left|Slugs, suspended by [[mucous]] thread and pad on wall.]] Slugs are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both female and male reproductive organs.<ref name=\"theoystersgarter1\">{{cite web |url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |title=Perverted cannibalistic hermaphrodites haunt the Pacific Northwest! \" The Oyster's Garter |publisher=Theoystersgarter.com |date=24 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413003808/http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |archivedate=13 April 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia.

In the banana slugs, the penis sometimes becomes trapped inside the body of the partner.

By doing this, they become firmly attached to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent.<ref name=\"illinois1\"/> Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the [[Kerry slug]].

Slugs often resort to aggression, attacking both [[conspecific]]s and individuals from other species when competing for resources. This aggressiveness is also influenced by [[seasonality]], because the availability of resources such as shelter and food may be compromised due to [[climatic]] conditions.

They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the crop, which can make individual items unsuitable to sell for aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovethegarden.com/product-details/slugclear-ultra |title=SlugClear Ultra: Highly efficient protection against slugs and snails &#124; Gardening tips and advice |publisher=LoveTheGarden.com |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>  Excessive buildup of slugs within some wastewater treatment plants with inadequate screening have been found to cause process issues resulting in increased energy and chemical use.<ref>Thompson, M.

Parasitic nematodes (''[[Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita]]'') are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems.
