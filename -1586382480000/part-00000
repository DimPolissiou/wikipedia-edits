McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.

McConnell Jr.''' (born February 20, 1942) is an American politician serving as Kentucky's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States senator]] and as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.

{"title_page": "Uniform Debt-Management Services Act", "text_new": "{{Expert-subject|Law|date=November 2008}}\n\nThe '''Uniform Debt-Management Services Act''' was [[promulgated]] in 2005 by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws|Uniform Law Commissioners]]. It provides the states with a comprehensive act governing national administration of debt counseling and management in a fair and effective way.\n\n[[Consumer debt]] counseling and management services have been available to individuals with serious credit problems going back to the 1950s. There are generally two kinds of services that have been available. Some of these services have provided counseling coupled with assisting debtors in establishing programs to pay off debts over an extended time. Others have provided consolidation and management services, in which agreements are reached with creditors to settle on a percentage of debt. Most of these services have collected a periodic amount from the debtors from which payment to creditors has been made. The general objective of these services has been debt satisfaction without resort to bankruptcy.\n\nThe history of debt counseling and management services is checkered. There have been numerous abuses and efforts to counter abuses statutorily in many states. These services have been criticized for their efforts to steer debtors away from bankruptcy when it may have been more advantageous and less costly to debtors to file. Many states prohibit [[Business|for-profit]] debt management services while permitting nonprofit debt counseling services. One of the continuing controversies is whether for profit services should be allowed even if regulated.\n\nHowever, federal bankruptcy reform effective in 2005 has changed the perspective on such services. For an individual to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, that individual will in most cases have to show that consumer debt counseling/management has been sought and attempted. This shifts a highly significant burden upon private services to perform honestly and effectively. Because the new bankruptcy rules are federal and apply in every state, regulating the counseling and management services in every state must be uniform in character for the new bankruptcy rules to be effective and for consumers to be protected.\n\nIn 2005, just in time for consideration in the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]]s, the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws|Uniform Law Commissioners]] promulgated the Uniform Debt-Management Services Act (UDMSA). It provides the states with a comprehensive act governing these services that will mean national administration of debt counseling and management in a fair and effective way.\n\nIn March 2008, several important amendments [http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/ucdc/2008final.pdf] were made to the UDMSA.   With these amendments, more than 20 states are executed to introduce the act in 2009.\n\nUDMSA may be divided into three basic parts: registration of services, service-debtor agreements and enforcement. Each part contributes to the comprehensive quality of the [[List of Uniform Acts (United States)|Uniform Act]].\n\n'''Registration'''\n\nNo service may enter into an agreement with any debtor in a state without registering as a consumer debt-management service in that state. Registration requires submission of detailed information concerning the service, including its financial condition, the identity of principals, locations at which service will be offered, form for agreements with debtors and business history in other jurisdictions. To register, a service must have an effective [[Insurance contract|insurance policy]] against fraud, dishonesty, theft and the like in an amount no less than $250,000.00. It must also provide a security bond of a minimum of $50,000.00 which has the state administrator as a beneficiary. If a registration substantially duplicates one in another state, the service may offer proof of registration in that other state to satisfy the registration requirements in a state. A satisfactory application will result in a certificate to do business from the administrator. A yearly renewal is required.\n\n'''Agreements'''\n\nIn order to enter into agreements with debtors, there is a [[Sufficiency of disclosure|disclosure requirement]] respecting fees and services to be offered, and the risks and benefits of entering into such a contract. The service must offer counseling services from a certified counselor and a plan must be created in consultation by the counselor for debt-management service to commence. The contents of the agreements and fees that may be charged are set by the statute. There is a penalty-free three-day right of rescission on the part of the debtor. The debtor may cancel the agreement also after 30 days, but may be subject to fees if that occurs. The service may terminate the agreement if required payments are delinquent for at least 60 days.\n\nAny payments for creditors received from a debtor must be kept in a trust account that may not be used to hold any other funds of the service. There are strict accounting requirements and periodic reporting requirements respecting funds held.\n\nWith respect to [[debt settlement]] services, the UDMSA provides for an overall fee cap based on the amount saved by the consumer (30% of the difference between the principal amount owed upon initiation of the service and the amount the debt is ultimately settled for).\n\n'''Enforcement'''\n\nThe Act prohibits specific acts on the part of a service including: misappropriation of funds in trust; settlement for more than 50% of a debt with a creditor without a debtor\u2019s consent; gifts or premiums to enter into an agreement; and representation that settlement has occurred without certification from a creditor. Enforcement of the Uniform Act occurs at two levels, the administrator and the individual level. The administrator has investigative powers, power to order an individual to [[cease and desist]]; power to assess a [[civil penalty]] up to $10,000.00, and the power to bring a civil action. An individual may bring a civil action for [[Damages|compensatory damages]], including triple damages if a service obtains payments not authorized in the Uniform Act, and may seek [[punitive damages]] and attorney\u2019s fees. A service has a [[good faith]] mistake defense against liability. The [[statute of limitations]] pertaining to an action by the administrator is four years, and two years for a [[Implied cause of action|private right of action]].\n\nBanks as regulated entities under other law are not subject to the Uniform Act, as are other kinds of activities that are incidental to other functions performed. For example, a title insurer that provides bill-paying service that is incidental to [[title insurance]] is not subject to it.\n\nUDMSA provides comprehensive regulation of debt counseling and management services. It becomes an essential part of the law of creditor and debtor as bankruptcy reform enacted by Congress in 2005 takes effect.\n\n== UDMSA & Debt Settlement Trade Associations ==\n\nDue to the rise of debt settlement as a [[debt relief]] alternative to bankruptcy, groups working in the industry established trade associations to help secure industry standards that will protect consumers against unethical business practices. These trade associations were also established to lobby state governments to adopt the recommendations of the UDMSA.  The two major trade associations are the United States Organization for [[Bankruptcy alternatives|Bankruptcy Alternatives]] (USOBA) [http://www.usoba.org], and The Association of Settlement Companies (TASC) [http://www.tascsite.org].\n\nThese organizations publish on their websites information about the UDMSA, debt settlement and the debt settlement industry.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://nccusl.org/Update/ National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) (Drafters of UDMSA)]\n* [http://www.iapda.org/ International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA) (Professional Perspective)]\n* [http://www.udmsa.org/ Official website of Uniform Debt Management Services Act (UDMSA)]\n* [http://www.usoba.org/ United States Organization for Bankruptcy Alternatives (USOBA)]\n* [http://www.tascsite.com/ The Association of Debt Settlement Companies (TASC)]\n*[https://qilo.io Student Loan Debt Aid]\n\n[[Category:Uniform Acts|Debt Management Services Act]]\n[[Category:United States bankruptcy legislation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expert-subject|Law|date=November 2008}}\n\nThe '''Uniform Debt-Management Services Act''' was [[promulgated]] in 2005 by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws|Uniform Law Commissioners]].

'''\u05db\u05e0\u05e8\u05d0''')</ref> and by [[Moses Margolies]] to mean cane reeds.<ref>Jerusalem Talmud, ''Megillah'' 1:1 [2b]</ref> Others say that it is so-called because its fruits are as sweet as those of the ''kinnara'' (Ziziphus spina-christi).<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Megillah'' 6a)</ref>\n\n===The lake===\nDue to its prominence, the city gave its name to the lake (the \"[[Sea of Galilee]]\") for long periods of history, as the Sea of Kinneret, Kinnerot, Gennesaret, or Ginosar.<ref name=\"Easton\"/> As other places around the lake rose to prominence, such as [[Tiberias]] and [[Khirbat al-Minya|Qasr al-Minya]], the name of the lake also changed to Lake Tiberias or Lake Minya.\n\n===The plain===\nThe name has also been used for the \"Plain of Gennesaret\", which stretches south of the ancient city. The plain's modern names are Plain of Ginosar in Hebrew and el-Ghuweir in Arabic.\n\n===Modern settlements===\nThe Israeli [[kibbutz]] [[Ginosar]] derives its name from the ancient town, though it is not located on its precise site. The settlements of [[Kinneret, Israel|Moshavat Kinneret]] and [[Kvutzat Kinneret]] are even further south, on the southwestern shore of the lake.\n\n==Identification and location==\n[[File:Grimm, J.L.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The offices of the clinical departments and the full-time clinical faculty members are in this hospital. Since 1995, the expansion program has increased the hospital's bed capacity to a total of 300 beds. The De La Salle University Medical Center includes many [[state-of-the-art]] medical equipment. The hospital also leads other private hospitals in Cavite in setting up medical wards intended for the poor enrolled in the Cavite Governor's health reform program, Dignidad at Kalidad (DK). <ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center |url=https://www.spchcm.com/hospitals/dlsumc |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The DLSUMC Medical Arts Center |url=https://architizer.com/projects/the-dlsumc-medical-arts-center/ |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DLSU Medical Center in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite upgrades facility |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2014/05/19/1324141/dlsu-medical-center-dasmarias-cavite-upgrades-facility |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe De La Salle University Medical Center was initially inaugurated as a 180-bed teaching and training hospital of the then Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine in 1982. In 1987, the De La Salle University system run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools acquired ownership of both the college and hospital. The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.

Owned and operated by the ''Hermano San Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Educational Foundation, Inc.'', it offers a [[Tertiary referral hospital|tertiary level of medical care]]. The offices of the clinical departments and the full-time clinical faculty members are in this hospital. Since 1995, the expansion program has increased the hospital's bed capacity to a total of 300 beds. The De La Salle University Medical Center includes many [[state-of-the-art]] medical equipment. The hospital also leads other private hospitals in Cavite in setting up medical wards intended for the poor enrolled in the Cavite Governor's health reform program, Dignidad at Kalidad (DK). <ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center |url=https://www.spchcm.com/hospitals/dlsumc |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The DLSUMC Medical Arts Center |url=https://architizer.com/projects/the-dlsumc-medical-arts-center/ |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DLSU Medical Center in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite upgrades facility |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2014/05/19/1324141/dlsu-medical-center-dasmarias-cavite-upgrades-facility |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe De La Salle University Medical Center was initially inaugurated as a 180-bed teaching and training hospital of the then Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine in 1982. In 1987, the De La Salle University system run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools acquired ownership of both the college and hospital. The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda. De Rivera Hall.\n\nIn October 1999 the De La Salle University Medical Center became the first hospital in the Philippines to receive an [[ISO 9001]] Certification and in July 2003 it received a Certification by the [[Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein|TUV\u2013Rheinland]] and Berlin\u2013 Brandenburg Group of Companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/dlsumc/about/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Departments and Services===\n*[[Anesthesia]]                        \n*[[Emergency Medicine]]                \n*[[Family medicine|Family and]] [[Community health|Community Medicine]]     \n*[[Internal Medicine]]\n**''[[Allergy]] and [[Immunology]], [[Cardiology]], [[Dermatology]], [[Endocrinology]], [[Gastroenterology]], [[Hematology]], [[Infectious Diseases]],  [[Nephrology]], [[Oncology]], [[Pulmonology]], [[Neurology]], and [[Rheumatology]]''\n*Laboratory Medicine\n**''Hematology, [[Serology]] and Immunology, [[Clinical Chemistry]], [[Microscopy]], [[Microbiology]], [[Blood Transfusion]], [[Surgical pathology|Surgical Pathology]] and [[Cytology]]''\n*[[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]]\n**''[[Perinatology]], OB-Gyne [[Ultrasound]], Trophoblastic Disease, Gynecologic Oncology, Reproductive Endocrinology and [[Infertility]], Infectious Disease, and Gynecologic [[Endoscopy]]''\n*[[Ophthalmology]]                    \n*[[Orthopedics]]\n**''[[Major trauma|Trauma]] Surgery, [[Sports Medicine]] and Arthroscopic Surgery, [[Joint]] Replacement Surgery, [[Shoulder]] Surgery, [[Vertebral column|Spine]] Surgery, Musculoskeletal [[Tumor]] Surgery, Orthopedic Pediatric Surgery, Limb Lengthening and Deformity Correction, [[Foot]] and [[Ankle]] Surgery''\n*[[Otorhinolaryngology]] (ENT)\n**''Head and Neck Surgery, [[Audiology]], [[Otology]], Rhinopharyngology, [[Laryngology]] and Voice Rehabilitation, Bronchoesophagology, Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, Facial Aesthetic Surgery, Newborn Hearing Screening, Hearing and Audiometer Evaluator, and [[Sleep medicine|Sleep Laboratory]]''\n*[[Pediatrics]]\n*[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]]\n*[[Psychiatry]]\n*[[Radiology]]\n**''[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[Computed tomography|CT-Scan]], [[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA Bone Densitometry]], [[Nuclear Medicine]], [[Mammography]], Ultrasonography, C-Arm Machine Scan and General Radiology''\n*[[Surgery]]\n\n==Angelo King Medical Research Center==\n<center>''Hall of Fame, Manuel L.
