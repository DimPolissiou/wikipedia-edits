{"title_page": "Praetorian Guard", "text_new": "{{redirect|Praetorians|video game|Praetorians (video game)}}\n{{short description|Imperial Roman unit who guarded the emperors}}\n{{Roman government}}\n{{RomanMilitary}}\nThe '''Praetorian Guard''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''cohortes praetoriae'') was an elite unit of the [[Imperial Roman army]] whose members served as personal bodyguards and [[military intelligence|intelligence]] for the [[Roman emperor]]s. During the era of the [[Roman Republic]], the Praetorians served as a small escort force for high-ranking officials such as senators or provincial governors like procurators, and also serving as bodyguards for high ranking officers within the Roman legions. With the republic's transition into the [[Roman Empire]], however, the first emperor, [[Augustus]], founded the Guard as his personal security detail. Although they continued to serve in this capacity for roughly three centuries, the Guard became notable for its intrigue and interference in Roman politics, to the point of overthrowing emperors and proclaiming their successors. In 312, the Guard was disbanded by [[Constantine the Great]].\n\n== Under the Roman Republic ==\nThe designation originated during the [[Roman Republic]], for the guards of [[Roman general]]s as early as the rise to prominence of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipio]] family around 275 BC. There was no permanent guard charged with the protection of military general officers; however, certain military officers chose to surround themselves with guards to ensure their security. For example, during the [[Siege of Numantia]], [[Scipio Aemilianus]] formed a troop of 500 men for his personal protection, as sorties were often quite dangerous for the upper ranks. This usage was then emulated and spread, as Roman generals occupied their positions for longer periods of time. Accordingly, this guard was referred to as ''Cohors Pr\u00e6toria''. In battle, these [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s would intervene as a final [[Military reserve|reserve]]. The [[Roman consul|consul]]s, when with an army under non-battle conditions, were protected by the [[lictor]]s, who would station themselves around the consuls' tents.\n\nAt the end of the year 40 BC, Octavian (the future [[Augustus]]) and his rival [[Mark Antony]] both operated Praetorian units organized individually. According to [[Appian]], amongst them were veterans forming cohorts. Antony commanded three cohorts in the [[Orient]] and in 32 BC, he issued coins in honor of his Praetorians. According to Paul Orose, Octavian commanded five cohorts at Actium.\n\nFollowing his victory at Actium, Octavian merged his forces with those of his adversary in a symbolic reunification of the Army of [[Julius Caesar]].\n\n== Under the empire ==\n[[File:Lens - Inauguration du Louvre-Lens le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la Galerie du Temps, n\u00b0 058.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Praetorians Relief]] with an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]] grasping a [[thunderbolt]] through its claws, in reference, to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].]]\nThe legionaries known as the Praetorian Guard were first hand-picked veterans of the Roman army who served as [[bodyguards]] to the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]. First established by Augustus, members of the Guard accompanied him on active campaign and served as [[secret police]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} protecting the civic administrations and rule of law imposed by the senate and the emperor. The Praetorian Guard was ultimately dissolved by Emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. They were distinct from the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] which provided close personal protection for the early Western Roman emperors.\n\nThey benefited from several advantages due their close proximity with the emperor: the Praetorians were the only ones admitted while bearing arms in the center of sacred [[Rome]] \u2013 the ''[[Pomerium]]''.\n\nTheir mandatory service was shorter in duration, for instance : 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions starting year 13 BC, then carried to, respectively, 16 to 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus.\n\nTheir pay was higher than that of a legionary. Under [[Nero]], the pay of a Praetorian was three and a half times that of a legionary, augmented by prime additions of ''[[donativum]]'', granted by each new emperor. This additional pay was the equivalent of several years of pay, and was often repeated at important events of the empire, or events that touched the imperial family: birthdays, births and marriages. Major monetary distributions or food subsidies renewed and compensated the fidelity of the Praetorians following each failed particular attempted plot (such as that of Messalina against Claudius in AD 48 or Piso against Nero in AD 65). The Praetorians received substantially higher pay<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Economy \u2013 Prices in Ancient Rome|url=http://www.ancientcoins.biz/pages/economy/ |publisher=Ancientcoins.bis |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> than other Roman soldiers in any of the legions, on a system known as ''sesquiplex stipendum'', or by pay-and-a-half. So if the legionaries received 250 [[Denarius|denarii]], the guards received 375 per annum (year). [[Domitian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] increased the ''stipendum'' (payment) to 1,500 denarii per year, distributed in January, May and September.\n\nFeared and dreaded by the population and by the [[Roman Senate]], the Praetorians received no sympathy from the Roman people. A famous poem by [[Juvenal]] recalls the nail left in his foot by the sandal of a Praetorian rushing by him. \"Praetorian\" has a pejorative sense in [[French language|French]], recalling the often troubling role of the ''Praetorian'' of antiquity.\n\n=== History ===\nIn [[ancient Rome]], ''[[praetor]]s'' were either civic or military leaders. The ''praetorianus'' were initially elite guards for military praetors, under the Republic.<ref>[http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-praetorian-guard 8 Things You May Not Know About the Praetorian Guard]</ref> As the Republic ended, the first emperor, Augustus, set up an elite guard of praetorianus to protect himself.\n\nThe early Praetorian Guard differed greatly from that in later times, which came to be a vital force in the power politics of Rome. While Augustus understood the need to have a protector in the maelstrom of Rome, he was careful to uphold the [[Principate|Republican veneer]] of his regime. Thus, he allowed only nine cohorts to be formed, each originally consisting of 500 men. He then increased them to 1,000 men each, but allowed three units to be kept on duty at any given time in the capital. A small number of detached cavalry units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men each were also organized. While they patrolled inconspicuously in the palace and major buildings, the others were stationed in the towns surrounding Rome. This system was not radically changed with the appointment by Augustus in 2 BC of two [[Praetorian prefect]]s, [[Quintus Ostorius Scapula]] and [[Publius Salvius Aper]], although organization and command were enhanced. Tacitus reports that the number of cohorts was increased to twelve from nine in AD 47. In AD 69 it was briefly increased to sixteen cohorts by [[Vitellius]], but [[Vespasian]] quickly reduced it again to nine.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==== Under the Julio-Claudian dynasty ====\nIn Rome, their principal duty was to mount the Guard at the house of Augustus on the Palatine, where the centuries and the [[turma]]e of the cohort in service mounted the guard outside the emperor's palace (the interior guard of the palace was mounted by the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]], often also referred to as ''[[Batavi (military unit)|Batavi]]'', and the ''[[Statores]]''<ref>In Rome, near the Emperor, they were designated as [[Statores Augusti]] (''Statores Praetorianorum'' starting from the 3rd century); they formed a ''[[Numerus (Roman military unit)|numerus]]'' assigned by the Praetorian prefect. This ''numerus'' was formed of five principal centuries which commanded the [[military police]]. At their head, there was a ''[[Curator Statorum]]'' and a ''[[Praefectus Statorum]]''.</ref> Augusti, a sort of [[military police]] which were found in the general staff headquarters of the Roman Army). Every afternoon, the serving tribune of the cohort would receive the password from the emperor personally. The command of this cohort was assumed directly by the emperor and not by the Praetorian prefect. After the construction of the Praetorian camp in 23 BC, there was another similar serving [[tribune]] placed in the Praetorian camp accordingly. Their functions included, among many, the escort of the emperor and the members of the imperial family, and if necessary to act as a sort of anti-riot police. Certain [[List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses|Empresses]] exclusively commanded their own [[Imperial Guard|Praetorian Guard]].\n\nAccording to Tacitus, in the year 23 BC, there were nine Praetorian cohorts (4500 men, the equivalent of a legion) to maintain peace in [[Italy]]; three were stationed in Rome, and the others, nearby.\n\nTheir mandatory service period was shorter than that of the legionaries: 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions in 13 BC: these were increased respectively to 16 and 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus, and their pay was higher than that of a legionaries.\n\nAn inscription recently discovered suggests that, towards the end of the reign of [[Augustus]], the number of cohorts increased to 12 during a brief period.<ref name=Rankov /> This inscription referred to one man who was the tribune of two successive cohorts: the eleventh cohort, apparently at the end of the reign of Augustus, and the fourth at the beginning of the reign of [[Tiberius]]. According to Tacitus, there were only nine cohorts in 23 AD. The three urban cohorts, which were numbered consecutively after the Praetorian cohorts, were removed near the end of the reign of Augustus; it seemed probable that the last three Praetorian cohorts were simply renamed as [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\nThe first intervention of the Praetorians on a battlefield since the wars of the end of the Republic took place during the ''mutinies of [[Pannonia]]'' and the ''mutinies of [[Germania]]''. On the death of Augustus in AD 14, his successor Tiberius was confronted by mutinies in the two armies of the ''Rhine'' and ''Pannonia'', who were protesting about their conditions of service, in comparison with the Praetorians. The forces of Pannonia were dealt with by [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], son of Tiberius (not to be confused with [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], brother of Tiberius), accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian Cavalry, and [[Imperial German Bodyguard]]s. The mutiny in Germania was repressed by the nephew and designated heir of Tiberius, [[Germanicus]], who later led legions and detachments of the Guard in a two-year campaign in Germania, and succeeded in recovering two of the three legionary [[Aquila (Roman)|eagles]] which had been lost at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].\n\nIt was under [[Tiberius]] that Lucius Aelius Seianus ([[Sejanus]]) rose in power and was among the first prefects to exploit his position to pursue his own ambitions. He concentrated under his command all the Praetorian cohorts in the new camp. Sejanus held the title of prefect jointly with his father, under Augustus, but became sole prefect in AD 15. He used that position to render himself essential to the new emperor Tiberius, who was unable to persuade the Senate to share the responsibility of governing the Empire. Sejanus, however, alienated Drusus, son of Tiberius, and when the heir to the throne, [[Germanicus]], died in AD 19, he was worried that Drusus would become the new emperor. Accordingly, he poisoned Drusus with the help of the latter's wife, and then immediately launched a ruthless elimination program against all competitors, persuading Tiberius to make him his heir apparent. He almost succeeded, but his plot was discovered and revealed in AD 31 and he was subsequently killed. Emperor Tiberius used for this purpose the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' which were not under the control of [[Sejanus]].\n\nIn AD 37 Caligula became emperor with the support of [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], Sejanus' successor as prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Under Caligula, whose reign lasted until AD 41, the overall strength of the Guard increased from 9 to 12 Praetorian cohorts.\n\n[[File:Proclaiming claudius emperor.png|thumb|left|250px|''Proclaiming Claudius Emperor'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], oil on canvas, 1867. According to one version of the story of Claudius' accession, members of the Praetorian Guard found him hiding behind a curtain in the aftermath of the assassination of Caligula in AD 41, and proclaimed him emperor.]]\n\nIn year 41, it was disgust and hostility of a praetorian tribune, named [[Cassius Chaerea]] \u2013 whom [[Caligula]] teased without mercy due to his squeaky voice \u2013 which led to the assassination of the emperor by officers of the guard. While the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] sacked all in a search to apprehend the murderers, the Senate proclaimed the restoration of a Republic. The Praetorians, who were pillaging the Palace, discovered [[Claudius]], uncle of [[Caligula]], hidden behind a curtain. Needing an emperor to justify their own existence, they brought him forth to the Praetorian camp and proclaimed him emperor. He is the first emperor proclaimed by the Praetorian Guard and compensated the guard with a prime bonus worth five years their salary. The Praetorians accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in 43 AD.\n\nWhen Claudius was poisoned, the Guard transferred their allegiance to [[Nero]] through the influence of his Praetorian prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]], who exercised a beneficial influence on the new emperor during the first five years of his reign. Officers of the Guard, including one of the two successors of [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]] as the Praetorian prefect, participated in [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso|Piso]]'s conspiracy in year 65. The other Praetorian prefect, [[Tigellinus]], headed the suppression of the conspiracy, and the Guard was compensated with a bonus of 500 denarii for each man.\n\n==== Year of the Four Emperors ====\n{{main|Year of the Four Emperors}}\nIn AD 69, the new colleague of Tigellinus, [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], managed to have the Praetorian Guard abandon [[Nero]] in favor of the contender [[Galba]]. [[Nymphidius Sabinus]] had promised 7500 [[denarius]] per man, but Galba refused to pay that amount because he stated \"It is my habit to recruit soldiers and not buy them\". This permitted his rival [[Otho]] to bribe 23 [[Speculatores]] of the Praetorian Guard to proclaim him emperor. Despite the opposition of the cohorts in service in the palace, Galba and his designated successor, the young Piso, were lynched on January 15.\n\nAfter supporting Otho against a third contender [[Vitellius]], the Praetorians were restrained following defeat and their centurions executed. They were replaced by 16 cohorts recruited from the legionnaires and auxiliaries loyal to Vitellius, almost 16,000 men. These ex-Praetorians then aided [[Vespasian]], the fourth Emperor, leading the attack against the Praetorian camp.\n\n==== Flavian dynasty ====\nUnder the Flavians, the Praetorians formed 9 new cohorts, of which [[Titus]], son of the emperor [[Vespasian]], became the prefect. [[Vespasian]] returned the effective strength of each unit to five hundred men. He also cancelled the guard service of the Praetorians at the entry to the emperor's palace, but retained guards within the palace itself.\n\nUnder Vespasian's second son, [[Domitian]], the number of cohorts was increased to 10, and the Praetorian Guard participated in fighting in [[Germania]] and on the [[Danube]] against the [[Dacians]]. It was in the course of these actions that the prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]] was defeated and killed in 86.\n\n==== Antonine dynasty ====\nFollowing assassination of [[Domitian]] in 96 the Praetorians demanded the execution of their prefect, [[Titus Petronius Secundus]], who had been implicated in the murder. The Guard supported [[Trajan]], commander of the Army of the Rhine, as new emperor.\n\nAt the death of [[Nerva]], at the beginning of 98, [[Trajan]] executed the remaining Praetorian prefect and his partisans. Trajan returned to Rome from the Rhine, probably accompanied by the new unit of ''[[equites singulares Augusti]]''. The Praetorian Guard had participated in the two [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars of Trajan]] (Dacian Wars 101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106). The Praetorian Guard served in the last [[Trajan's Parthian campaign|campaign of Trajan against the Parthians of 113\u2013117]].\n\nDuring the 2nd century, the Praetorian Guard accompanied [[Lucius Verus]] in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 161\u2013166|Oriental War Campaign of 161\u2013166 AD]], as well as accompanying [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in his northern campaigns between 169\u2013175 and 178\u2013180. Two prefects were killed during these expeditions.\n\nWith the accession of [[Commodus]], in 180, the Praetorian Guard returned to Rome. [[Tigidius Perennis]] (AD 182\u2013185) and [[freedman]] [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander]] (AD 186\u2013190) exercised considerable influence on the emperor. [[Tigidius Perennis|Perennis]] was killed by a delegation of 1500 persons of [[Great Britain]] which came forth to complain about his interference in the affairs of the province (a delegation of [[Lanciarii]] of the 3 legions of Great Britain). Cleander abused his influence to nominate and dismiss prefects.\n\nIn 188, Cleander obtained the joint command of the Guard with the two prefects. Cleander ordered a massacre of civilians carried by the ''equites singulares Augusti'' which led to an arranged battle with the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\n==== Severan dynasty ====\nCommodus fell victim to a conspiracy directed by his Praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] in 192. The new emperor [[Pertinax]], who took part in the conspiracy, paid the Praetorians a premium of 3,000 [[denarius|denarii]]; however he was assassinated three months later, on March 28 193, by a group of Guards. The Praetorians then put the empire up to auction and [[Didius Julianus]] bought the title of emperor. However the armies of the Danube chose instead the governor of [[Pannonia Superior]], [[Septimius Severus]], who besieged Rome and tricked the Praetorians when they came out unarmed. The Praetorian Guard was dissolved and replaced by men transferred from his own army.\n\nThe new Guard of Septimius Severus made their mark against his rival [[Clodius Albinus]] at the [[Battle of Lugdunum|Battle of Lyon]] in 197, and accompanied the emperor to the [[Orient]] from 197 to 202, then to [[Britannia]] from 208 until his death at [[York]] in 211.\n\n[[Caracalla]], son of [[Septimius Severus]], lost favour with his troops by assassinating his own brother and co-emperor, Geta, immediately after his succession. He also created problems by trying to recreate a Macedonian phalanx witnessed previously in the Roman Army. Finally, in 217, while on campaign in the [[Orient]], he was assassinated at the instigation of his prefect [[Macrinus]].\n\nAfter the elimination of the latter, the Praetorians opposed the new emperor [[Elagabalus]], priest of the oriental cult of Elagabal, and replaced him by his 13-year-old cousin [[Severus Alexander]] in 222.\n\nIn this period the position of [[Praetorian prefect]] in [[Italy]] came increasingly to resemble a general administrative post, and there was a tendency to appoint jurists such as [[Papinian]], who occupied the post from 203 until his elimination and execution at the ascent of Caracalla. Under [[Severus Alexander]] the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was held by the lawyer [[Ulpian]] until his assassination by the Praetorian Guard in the presence of the emperor himself.\n\n==== 3rd century ====\nIn the spring of 238, under [[Maximinus Thrax]], the bulk of the Praetorian Guard was employed on active service. Defended by only a small residual garrison, the Praetorian camp was attacked by a civilian crowd acting in support of [[Roman Senate|senators]] in revolt against the Gordian emperors. The failure of Maximinus Thrax to win the [[civil war]] against the contenders [[Gordian I]] and [[Gordian II]] led to his death at the hands of his own troops, including the Praetorians. The senatorial candidates for the throne, [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]], recalled the Praetorian Guard to Rome, only to find themselves under attack by the Praetorians. Both were killed on July 29 238 and [[Gordian III]] triumphed.\n\nAfter 238, literary and epigraphic sources dry up, and information on the Praetorian Guard becomes rare. In 249, the Praetorians assassinated [[Philippus II]], son of the emperor [[Philip the Arab]]. In 272, in the reign of the emperor [[Aurelian]], they took part in an expedition against [[Palmyra]]. In 284, Diocletian reduced the status of the Praetorians; they were no longer to be part of palace life, as Diocletian lived in [[Nicomedia]], some 60 miles (100&nbsp;km) from [[Byzantium]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Two new corps, the [[Jovians and Herculians|Ioviani and Herculiani]] (named after the gods Jove, or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Hercules]], associated with the senior and junior emperor), replaced the Praetorians as the personal protectors of the emperors, a practice that remained intact with the [[Tetrarchy]]. In 297 they were in [[Africa]] with [[Maximian]]. By the time Diocletian retired on May 1, 305, their ''Castra Praetoria'' seems to have housed only a minor garrison of Rome.\n\n==== Dissolution ====\nDuring the early [[4th century]], ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] attempted to disband the Praetorian Guard on the orders of [[Galerius]]. In response, the Praetorians turned to [[Maxentius]], the son of the retired emperor Maximian, and proclaimed him their emperor on 28 October 306. By 312, however, [[Constantine the Great]] marched on Rome with an army in order to eliminate Maxentius and gain control of the [[Western Roman Empire]], resulting in the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. Ultimately, Constantine's army achieved a decisive victory against the Praetorians, whose emperor was killed during the fighting. With the death of Maxentius, Constantine definitively disbanded the remnants of the Praetorian Guard. The remaining soldiers were sent out to various corners of the empire, and the ''Castra Praetoria'' was dismantled in a grand gesture inaugurating a new age in Roman history and ending that of the Praetorians.\n\n=== Participation in wars ===\nWhile campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman army. On the death of Augustus in 14 AD, his successor, Tiberius, was faced with mutinies among both the Rhine and [[Pannonian]] legions. According to [[Tacitus]], the Pannonian forces were dealt with by Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian cavalry and some of the [[German bodyguard]]. The German mutiny was put down by Tiberius' nephew and adopted son [[Germanicus]], his intended heir, who then led the legions and detachments of the Guard in an invasion of Germany over the next two years. The Guard saw much action in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] in 69, fighting well for [[Otho]] at the first [[battle of Bedriacum]]. Under [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]], the guard took part in wars from [[Dacia]] to [[Mesopotamia]], while with [[Marcus Aurelius]], years were spent on the Danubian frontier during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.\n\n=== Political role ===\nPraetorian Cohorts intervened on numerous occasions in the struggle for the imperial succession. Lacking troops of its own, the Senate had no choice each time but to accept the choice of the Praetorians as well as that of the various legions. The new emperor was always proclaimed by the Praetorians before being ratified by the Senate and the legions stationed in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the death of Sejanus, who was sacrificed for the [[donativum|donative]] (imperial gift) promised by Tiberius, the Guards began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody game in the Empire. For the right price, or at will, they assassinated emperors, bullied their own prefects, or turned on the people of Rome. In 41, [[Caligula]] was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard, along with his wife and daughter. The Praetorians placed his uncle [[Claudius]] on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision. In 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], after the emperor [[Galba]] failed to provide a donative for the Praetorians, they transferred their allegiance to [[Otho]] and assassinated the emperor. Otho acquiesced in the Praetorians' demands and granted them the right to appoint their own prefects, ensuring their loyalty. After defeating Otho, [[Vitellius]] disbanded the Guard and established a new Guard sixteen cohorts strong. [[Vespasian]] relied in the war against Vitellius upon the disgruntled cohorts the emperor had dismissed, and reduced the number of cohorts back to nine upon becoming emperor himself. As a further safeguard, he appointed his son, [[Titus]], as Praetorian prefect.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 118\u2013122.</ref>\n\nWhile the guard had the power to make or break emperors, it had no formal role in government administration, unlike the personnel of the palace, the Senate, and the bureaucracy. Often after an outrageous act of violence, revenge by the new ruler was forthcoming. In 193, [[Didius Julianus]] purchased the Empire from the Guard for a vast sum, when the Guard auctioned it off after killing [[Pertinax]]. Later that year [[Septimius Severus]] marched into Rome, disbanded the Guard and started a new formation from his own Pannonian legions. Unruly mobs in Rome often fought with the Praetorians in [[Maximinus Thrax]]'s reign in vicious street battles.\n\nIn 271, [[Aurelian]] sailed east to destroy the power of [[Palmyra]], Syria, with a force of legionary detachments, Praetorian cohorts, and other cavalry units, and easily defeated the Palmyrenes. This led to the orthodox view that [[Diocletian]] and his colleagues evolved the ''sacer comitatus'' (the field escort of the emperors). The ''sacer comitatus'' included field units that used a selection process and command structure modeled after the old Praetorian cohorts, but it was not of uniform composition and was much larger than a Praetorian cohort.\n\n=== Organization ===\n==== Leadership ====\n{{Main|Praetorian prefect|Praetorian prefecture}}\n\nStarting in the year 2 BC, the [[Praetorian prefect]] was the commanding officer of the Praetorian Guard (previously each cohort was independent and under the orders of a [[tribune]] of [[Equites|equestrian]] rank). This role (chief of all troops stationed in Rome), was in practice a key position of the Roman [[polity]].\n\nFrom [[Vespasian]] onwards the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was always held by an equestrian of the ''eques'' order. (''Equestrians'' were traditionally that class of citizens who could equip themselves to serve in the Roman Army on [[cavalry|horseback]]).\n\nFrom the year 2 BC, the cohorts were under the control of two prefectures; however cohorts continued to be organized independently, each commanded by a tribune. Tribunes had as immediate subordinates ordinary [[Centurion]]s, all of equal rank except for the ''[[Trecenarius]]'', the first and prime of all centurions of the Praetorian Cohorts, who commanded also the 300 ''[[speculatores]]'', and with the exception of his second, the ''[[Prince Castrorum]]''.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nFrom the second century the Praetorian prefect oversaw not only the Praetorian Cohorts but also the rest of the garrison of Rome, including the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' (\"urban cohorts\") and the ''equites singulares Augusti'', but not the [[Vigiles|''Vigiles'' cohorts]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Praetorian Cohorts by the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] after he defeated them at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, the role of the Praetorian prefect in the Empire became purely administrative, ruling large territories (''prefectures'') comprising Roman [[diocese]]s (geographical subdivisions of the [[Roman Empire]]) in the name of the Emperor.\n\n==== Size and composition ====\nThe Praetorian Cohorts were designated as ''Equitatae'' ([[cavalry]]) ''[[Turma]]e'' (troops) with [[Roman legion|centuries]] formed of [[infantry]], initially of 500 men each.<ref name=Bohec21>Y. Le Bohec, ''L'Arm\u00e9e Romaine'', Picard, 1989, {{ISBN|2-7084-0744-9}}</ref>\n\nIn order not to alienate the population of Rome, while conserving Republican civilian traditions, the Praetorians did not wear their armor while in the heart of the city. Instead they often wore a formal toga, which distinguished them from civilians but remained in a respectable civilian attire, the mark of a Roman citizen. Augustus, conscious of risking the only military force present in the city, often avoided concentrating them and imposed this dress code.\n\nFrom the reign of Tiberius, their camp was situated on the [[Quirinal]] Hill, outside Rome. In 26 AD, [[Sejanus]], Praetorian prefect, and the favorite of emperor [[Tiberius]], united the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]] with nine Praetorian Cohorts, dispersed at that time throughout [[Italy]], in one large camp situated beyond the [[Servian Wall]], on the Esquiline Hill, the ''[[Castra Praetoria]]''.\n\nFor the 2nd century, calculations from lists of significant demobilisations suggest an increase in size to nearly 1,500 men per cohort (perhaps a doubling of 800 (since [[Vespasian]]), probably organized in 20 centuries) under [[Commodus]] in year (187\u2013188) or under [[Septimius Severus]] (193\u2013211), which matches the probable numbers of effectives for Urban Cohorts during the time of [[Cassius Dio]]. These figures suggest an overall size for the Guard of 4,500\u20136,000 men under [[Augustus]], 12,800 under [[Vitellius]], 7,200 under [[Vespasian]], 8,000 from [[Domitian]] until [[Commodus]] or [[Septimius Severus]], and 15,000 later on.<ref name=Rankov>Dr Boris Rankov, ''The Praetorian Guard'', Osprey Publishing, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-85532-361-2}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 2nd century, Italians made up 89% of the Praetorian Guard. Under [[Septimius Severus]], recruitment evolved to authorize the inclusion of legionaries of the Roman army, as well as of the battle hardened ''Army of the Danube''. Severus stationed his supporters with him in Rome, and the Praetorian Guards remained loyal to his choices.\n\n==== Praetorian Cavalry ====\nInitially each cohort included, as for a [[Roman legion]], a [[cavalry]] detachment; this should not be confused with the ''equites singulares Augusti'' who appeared under the emperor [[Trajan]]. The Praetorian could become a cavalryman (''Eques'') after almost five years service in the [[infantry]]. These Praetorians remained listed in their Centuries of origin, but operated in a ''[[turma]]'' of 30 men each commanded by an ''[[Optioequitum]]''.\n\nThere was probably one ''turma'' of cavalry for two centuries of infantry.<ref name=Rankov /> Hence, three ''turmae'' per cohorts of the ''Augustan period'', five per cohort in 100 CE\u2013200 CE, and ten per cohort after 200 CE, with a ''[[vexillum]]'' (flag) as emblem for each ''turma''.\n\n==== Speculatores Augusti ====\nThe ''[[speculatores]] Augusti'' were cavalrymen assigned to the same tasks as the ''[[Speculatores]]'' of the legions and the [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments|auxiliary units]] (messengers in charge of transmitting intelligence, and clandestine agents).\n\nAbout 300 in total (30 per cohort), they formed a unit under the orders of the senior [[Centurion]], the ''[[Trecenarius]]''. Selected for their impressive physique, they were used by the Emperor for [[clandestine operations]] and tasks such as arrests, imprisonment, and executions.\n\nOne of their roles was to accompany the emperor on his foreign campaign journeys (a role which would later be handled by the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti''). [[Claudius]] was in the habit of surrounding himself with ''Speculatores'' when attending dinners.\n\nThe close security protection detail of Galba, of [[Otho]] and the dynastic line of the Flavians appear to have been formed of ''[[Speculatores]]'' (who replaced the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] disbanded by [[Galba]]).\n\nFollowing the assassination of emperor [[Domitian]], his successor [[Nerva]] was placed under the protection of [[Trajan]], to counter possible revenge attempts and mutinies. Trajan was commander of the most important army of the time, that of the Army of Germania, and he nominated him as his heir. Accordingly, and following such an act, [[Trajan]], aiming to reinforce his security detail in relation to the ''Speculatores'' who had remained loyal to Domitian, replaced them as close protection security detail with the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti'' (modelled on the ''Singulares'' of a provincial governor, a post held by [[Trajan]]). The some 300 ''[[Speculatores]]'' were reassigned by [[Trajan]] to the corps of Praetorian cohorts.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nThey were distinguished by a special (but unknown) style of boots, the ''Speculatoria Caliga'' (according to [[Suetonius]]) and they received special honorific diplomas in bronze at demobilization. They had their own Equestrian instructors (''Exercitatores'').<ref name=Rankov />\n\n=== Service in the Praetorian Guard ===\n[[File:Q.PomponiusPoeninus.jpg|thumb|right200px| Funeral inscription of Quintus Pomponius Poeninus, soldier of the IV Praetorian Cohort<ref>Mus\u00e9e de [[C\u00e1ceres (Espagne)|C\u00e1ceres]]. ''Q(uintus) Pomponius Potentinus / Ser(gia) h(ic) s(itus) e(st) / C(aius) Pomponius Potentinus / mil(es) c(o)hor(tis) IIII praet(oriae) / test(amento) fieri iussit''.</ref>]]\n\nOriginally, the Praetorian Guard was recruited from the populations of central [[Italy]] ([[Etruria]], [[Umbria]] and [[Latium]] according to [[Tacitus]]). Recruits were between 15 and 32 years of age, compared to legionary recruits who ranged from 18 to 23 years of age. According to [[Cassius Dio]], during the first two centuries AD and before the reform of [[Septimius Severus]], the Praetorians were exclusively limited to [[Italy]], Spain (Roman province), [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Noricum]] (current [[Austria]]).\n\nUnder the reign of [[Vitellius]], and starting from [[Septimius Severus]], men were transferred from the [[Vigiles Urbanus|Urban Vigiles]], [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban cohorts]], and the various [[Roman legion|legions]]. This recent method and manner of recruitment at the corps of the legions became the normal procedure to recruit in the 3rd century after [[Septimius Severus]] dealt with the undisciplined Praetorians who assassinated [[Pertinax]] in 193, and replaced them with men from his own Danube legions.\n\nAt that time, the Praetorians represented the best soldiers from the legions (principally from Illyria). They were a group of elite of soldiers starting from the 3rd century, and not a category of socially privileged soldiers (such as the Italians at the time of [[Augustus]]). The Italians formed the base of the recruitment of the ''Legio II Parthica'', a new legion created and stationed in Italy.\n\nTo be admitted to the Guard, a man had to be in good physical condition, have a [[good moral character]], and come from a respectable family. In addition, he had to make use of all sorts of patronages available to him in order to obtain letters of recommendations from important leading figures in society. Once past the recruitment procedure he was designated as ''Probatus'', and assigned as a ''Miles'' (soldier) to one of the centuries of a cohort. After two years, if he attracted the attention of his superiors by influence or merit, he could attain the post of ''Immunis'' (similar to corporal), perhaps as a commis (junior chief) at general headquarters or as a technician. This promotion exempted him from daily chores. After another two years he could be promoted to ''Principalis'', with a double salary, in charge of delivering messages (''Tesserarius'') or as an assistant centurion (''Optio'') or standard bearer (''Signifer'') at the corps of the century; or, if literate and numerate, he could join the administrative staff of the prefect.\n\nOnly a few soldiers could attain the rank of ''Principalis''; however those that did, during the course of their service, were designated ''Evocati Augusti'' by the emperor. This designation allowed them to be promoted to technical administrative posts, or instructors in Rome, or to a century in a legion, and accordingly extend their career. Certain ''principalis'' could at the end of their career be promoted to [[Centurion]] in the Guard; this would be the peak of his career. Anyone ambitious for further promotion would need to transfer to a legion.\n\nThe [[Military tribune]]s (''Tribuni Militum'') at the head of the cohorts were [[Roman cavalry]]men. In contrast to many superior cadres of the Army, who originated from the Equestrian Order, these tribunes started their career in the ranks of the Guard and were promoted from the ranks in the hierarchy. Next after becoming [[Centurion]]s, they had to serve for a period of one year as superior centurions in one or several legions before achieving the status of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' (the highest ranked [[Centurion]] in a legion). Upon return to [[Rome]], they occupied successively the positions of Tribunes of the Vigiles, Tribune of the Urban Cohort and finally Tribune of the Guard.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180>[[Paul Petit (historian)|Paul Petit]], ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Empire romain'', Seuil, 1974, {{ISBN|2020026775}}, p. 180</ref>\n\nOther leading paths towards the tribunate were possible, including service entirely made in the legions, attaining the rank of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' before departing to Rome. Nevertheless, all tribunes were combat veterans with extensive military experience.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> Each tribune served in Rome for one year, following which, a certain number of the men would retire.\n\nA few of them, ranking placement at the top of the hierarchy, could obtain a second term as ''Primus Pilus'' and advance towards the superior echelons of the equestrian career<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> possibly becoming the [[Praetorian prefect]].\n\nThe majority of the prefects, however, were ordinary men of the equestrian rank by birth. The men who attained the command of the Guard following year 2 BC were [[equites]] with an elevated seniority, classifying right behind the prefect of Egypt. Starting from [[Vespasian]], whose son, [[Titus]] was himself a Praetorian prefect, they were ranked first.\n\n=== Equipment and traditions ===\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionnaires, disposed of various [[Roman military personal equipment|equipment]] to execute different missions. More particularly as bodyguard, escort or reserve military force, they housed adaptable equipment for each function.\n\nFor heavy packed combat infantry lines ([[Roman infantry tactics|Triplex Acies System]]), they mounted helmets, armor ([[Lorica segmentata]], [[Mail (armour)|Lorica hamata]], [[Lorica squamata]] specially in the 2nd and 3rd centuries), heavy colorful shields ([[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]), heavy javelins ([[Pilum|pila]]), and later even long spears and lighter javelins (hastas, lancea).\n\nPraetorian Guard helmets included tall [[Galea (helmet)|Galea]] with elaborate detail worked into the metal. Shields were ovoid and more robust compared with the regular rectangular shape sometimes used by the legions. Each legion had its own emblem displayed on its [[Scutum (shield)]] and the Praetorian Guard were probably the only unit to include additional insignia on their shields. Each cohort had their own version of Praetorian insignia. Praetorian Guard units could wear lion skin capes and their colours were so decorated with awards, that the men had difficulty in carrying them on long marches.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard colours included the winged [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess of victory]].\n\nFor escorts, the oval shields and lances replaced the scuta and pila. Missions in Rome at the heart of the city in principle were forbidden to soldiers, so they wore a toga.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionaries, shared similar insignia, mainly on their shields. Praetorian Guard shields included [[Aquila (Roman)|wings]] and [[thunderbolt]]s, referring to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and also uniquely included Scorpions, [[Stars]] and [[Crescent]]s.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pr\u00e4torianer.jpg|A Praetorian soldier from the 2nd century AD \u2013 retrieved in [[Pozzuoli]] (1800).\nFile:CLAUDIUS - RIC I 25 - 792104.jpg|[[Claudius]], the [[Roman Emperor|4th Emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] AD 41\u201354.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Varangian Guard]]\n* [[Frumentarii]]\n* [[Scholae Palatinae]]\n* [[Kheshig]]\n* [[Pushtigban]]\n* [[Lictor]] (fulfilled a similar role)\n* [[Praetorianism]]\n* [[Jedi Order]] (fictional, though functionally similar in their role as steering the leadership of the Galactic Republic)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n* Sandra J.

During the era of the [[Roman Republic]], the Praetorians served as a small escort force for high-ranking officials such as senators or provincial governors like procurators, and also serving as bodyguards for high ranking officers within the Roman legions. With the republic's transition into the [[Roman Empire]], however, the first emperor, [[Augustus]], founded the Guard as his personal security detail. Although they continued to serve in this capacity for roughly three centuries, the Guard became notable for its intrigue and interference in Roman politics, to the point of overthrowing emperors and proclaiming their successors. In 312, the Guard was disbanded by [[Constantine the Great]].\n\n== Under the Roman Republic ==\nThe designation originated during the [[Roman Republic]], for the guards of [[Roman general]]s as early as the rise to prominence of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipio]] family around 275 BC. There was no permanent guard charged with the protection of military general officers; however, certain military officers chose to surround themselves with guards to ensure their security. For example, during the [[Siege of Numantia]], [[Scipio Aemilianus]] formed a troop of 500 men for his personal protection, as sorties were often quite dangerous for the upper ranks. This usage was then emulated and spread, as Roman generals occupied their positions for longer periods of time. Accordingly, this guard was referred to as ''Cohors Pr\u00e6toria''. In battle, these [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s would intervene as a final [[Military reserve|reserve]]. The [[Roman consul|consul]]s, when with an army under non-battle conditions, were protected by the [[lictor]]s, who would station themselves around the consuls' tents.\n\nAt the end of the year 40 BC, Octavian (the future [[Augustus]]) and his rival [[Mark Antony]] both operated Praetorian units organized individually. According to [[Appian]], amongst them were veterans forming cohorts. Antony commanded three cohorts in the [[Orient]] and in 32 BC, he issued coins in honor of his Praetorians. According to Paul Orose, Octavian commanded five cohorts at Actium.\n\nFollowing his victory at Actium, Octavian merged his forces with those of his adversary in a symbolic reunification of the Army of [[Julius Caesar]].\n\n== Under the empire ==\n[[File:Lens - Inauguration du Louvre-Lens le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la Galerie du Temps, n\u00b0 058.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Praetorians Relief]] with an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]] grasping a [[thunderbolt]] through its claws, in reference, to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].]]\nThe legionaries known as the Praetorian Guard were first hand-picked veterans of the Roman army who served as [[bodyguards]] to the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]. First established by Augustus, members of the Guard accompanied him on active campaign and served as [[secret police]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} protecting the civic administrations and rule of law imposed by the senate and the emperor. The Praetorian Guard was ultimately dissolved by Emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. They were distinct from the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] which provided close personal protection for the early Western Roman emperors.\n\nThey benefited from several advantages due their close proximity with the emperor: the Praetorians were the only ones admitted while bearing arms in the center of sacred [[Rome]] \u2013 the ''[[Pomerium]]''.\n\nTheir mandatory service was shorter in duration, for instance : 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions starting year 13 BC, then carried to, respectively, 16 to 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus.\n\nTheir pay was higher than that of a legionary. Under [[Nero]], the pay of a Praetorian was three and a half times that of a legionary, augmented by prime additions of ''[[donativum]]'', granted by each new emperor. This additional pay was the equivalent of several years of pay, and was often repeated at important events of the empire, or events that touched the imperial family: birthdays, births and marriages. Major monetary distributions or food subsidies renewed and compensated the fidelity of the Praetorians following each failed particular attempted plot (such as that of Messalina against Claudius in AD 48 or Piso against Nero in AD 65). The Praetorians received substantially higher pay<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Economy \u2013 Prices in Ancient Rome|url=http://www.ancientcoins.biz/pages/economy/ |publisher=Ancientcoins.bis |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> than other Roman soldiers in any of the legions, on a system known as ''sesquiplex stipendum'', or by pay-and-a-half. So if the legionaries received 250 [[Denarius|denarii]], the guards received 375 per annum (year). [[Domitian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] increased the ''stipendum'' (payment) to 1,500 denarii per year, distributed in January, May and September.\n\nFeared and dreaded by the population and by the [[Roman Senate]], the Praetorians received no sympathy from the Roman people. A famous poem by [[Juvenal]] recalls the nail left in his foot by the sandal of a Praetorian rushing by him. \"Praetorian\" has a pejorative sense in [[French language|French]], recalling the often troubling role of the ''Praetorian'' of antiquity.\n\n=== History ===\nIn [[ancient Rome]], ''[[praetor]]s'' were either civic or military leaders. The ''praetorianus'' were initially elite guards for military praetors, under the Republic.<ref>[http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-praetorian-guard 8 Things You May Not Know About the Praetorian Guard]</ref> As the Republic ended, the first emperor, Augustus, set up an elite guard of praetorianus to protect himself.\n\nThe early Praetorian Guard differed greatly from that in later times, which came to be a vital force in the power politics of Rome. While Augustus understood the need to have a protector in the maelstrom of Rome, he was careful to uphold the [[Principate|Republican veneer]] of his regime. Thus, he allowed only nine cohorts to be formed, each originally consisting of 500 men. He then increased them to 1,000 men each, but allowed three units to be kept on duty at any given time in the capital. A small number of detached cavalry units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men each were also organized. While they patrolled inconspicuously in the palace and major buildings, the others were stationed in the towns surrounding Rome. This system was not radically changed with the appointment by Augustus in 2 BC of two [[Praetorian prefect]]s, [[Quintus Ostorius Scapula]] and [[Publius Salvius Aper]], although organization and command were enhanced. Tacitus reports that the number of cohorts was increased to twelve from nine in AD 47. In AD 69 it was briefly increased to sixteen cohorts by [[Vitellius]], but [[Vespasian]] quickly reduced it again to nine.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==== Under the Julio-Claudian dynasty ====\nIn Rome, their principal duty was to mount the Guard at the house of Augustus on the Palatine, where the centuries and the [[turma]]e of the cohort in service mounted the guard outside the emperor's palace (the interior guard of the palace was mounted by the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]], often also referred to as ''[[Batavi (military unit)|Batavi]]'', and the ''[[Statores]]''<ref>In Rome, near the Emperor, they were designated as [[Statores Augusti]] (''Statores Praetorianorum'' starting from the 3rd century); they formed a ''[[Numerus (Roman military unit)|numerus]]'' assigned by the Praetorian prefect. This ''numerus'' was formed of five principal centuries which commanded the [[military police]]. At their head, there was a ''[[Curator Statorum]]'' and a ''[[Praefectus Statorum]]''.</ref> Augusti, a sort of [[military police]] which were found in the general staff headquarters of the Roman Army). Every afternoon, the serving tribune of the cohort would receive the password from the emperor personally. The command of this cohort was assumed directly by the emperor and not by the Praetorian prefect. After the construction of the Praetorian camp in 23 BC, there was another similar serving [[tribune]] placed in the Praetorian camp accordingly. Their functions included, among many, the escort of the emperor and the members of the imperial family, and if necessary to act as a sort of anti-riot police. Certain [[List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses|Empresses]] exclusively commanded their own [[Imperial Guard|Praetorian Guard]].\n\nAccording to Tacitus, in the year 23 BC, there were nine Praetorian cohorts (4500 men, the equivalent of a legion) to maintain peace in [[Italy]]; three were stationed in Rome, and the others, nearby.\n\nTheir mandatory service period was shorter than that of the legionaries: 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions in 13 BC: these were increased respectively to 16 and 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus, and their pay was higher than that of a legionaries.\n\nAn inscription recently discovered suggests that, towards the end of the reign of [[Augustus]], the number of cohorts increased to 12 during a brief period.<ref name=Rankov /> This inscription referred to one man who was the tribune of two successive cohorts: the eleventh cohort, apparently at the end of the reign of Augustus, and the fourth at the beginning of the reign of [[Tiberius]]. According to Tacitus, there were only nine cohorts in 23 AD. The three urban cohorts, which were numbered consecutively after the Praetorian cohorts, were removed near the end of the reign of Augustus; it seemed probable that the last three Praetorian cohorts were simply renamed as [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\nThe first intervention of the Praetorians on a battlefield since the wars of the end of the Republic took place during the ''mutinies of [[Pannonia]]'' and the ''mutinies of [[Germania]]''. On the death of Augustus in AD 14, his successor Tiberius was confronted by mutinies in the two armies of the ''Rhine'' and ''Pannonia'', who were protesting about their conditions of service, in comparison with the Praetorians. The forces of Pannonia were dealt with by [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], son of Tiberius (not to be confused with [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], brother of Tiberius), accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian Cavalry, and [[Imperial German Bodyguard]]s. The mutiny in Germania was repressed by the nephew and designated heir of Tiberius, [[Germanicus]], who later led legions and detachments of the Guard in a two-year campaign in Germania, and succeeded in recovering two of the three legionary [[Aquila (Roman)|eagles]] which had been lost at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].\n\nIt was under [[Tiberius]] that Lucius Aelius Seianus ([[Sejanus]]) rose in power and was among the first prefects to exploit his position to pursue his own ambitions. He concentrated under his command all the Praetorian cohorts in the new camp. Sejanus held the title of prefect jointly with his father, under Augustus, but became sole prefect in AD 15. He used that position to render himself essential to the new emperor Tiberius, who was unable to persuade the Senate to share the responsibility of governing the Empire. Sejanus, however, alienated Drusus, son of Tiberius, and when the heir to the throne, [[Germanicus]], died in AD 19, he was worried that Drusus would become the new emperor. Accordingly, he poisoned Drusus with the help of the latter's wife, and then immediately launched a ruthless elimination program against all competitors, persuading Tiberius to make him his heir apparent. He almost succeeded, but his plot was discovered and revealed in AD 31 and he was subsequently killed. Emperor Tiberius used for this purpose the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' which were not under the control of [[Sejanus]].\n\nIn AD 37 Caligula became emperor with the support of [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], Sejanus' successor as prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Under Caligula, whose reign lasted until AD 41, the overall strength of the Guard increased from 9 to 12 Praetorian cohorts.\n\n[[File:Proclaiming claudius emperor.png|thumb|left|250px|''Proclaiming Claudius Emperor'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], oil on canvas, 1867. According to one version of the story of Claudius' accession, members of the Praetorian Guard found him hiding behind a curtain in the aftermath of the assassination of Caligula in AD 41, and proclaimed him emperor.]]\n\nIn year 41, it was disgust and hostility of a praetorian tribune, named [[Cassius Chaerea]] \u2013 whom [[Caligula]] teased without mercy due to his squeaky voice \u2013 which led to the assassination of the emperor by officers of the guard. While the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] sacked all in a search to apprehend the murderers, the Senate proclaimed the restoration of a Republic. The Praetorians, who were pillaging the Palace, discovered [[Claudius]], uncle of [[Caligula]], hidden behind a curtain. Needing an emperor to justify their own existence, they brought him forth to the Praetorian camp and proclaimed him emperor. He is the first emperor proclaimed by the Praetorian Guard and compensated the guard with a prime bonus worth five years their salary. The Praetorians accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in 43 AD.\n\nWhen Claudius was poisoned, the Guard transferred their allegiance to [[Nero]] through the influence of his Praetorian prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]], who exercised a beneficial influence on the new emperor during the first five years of his reign. Officers of the Guard, including one of the two successors of [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]] as the Praetorian prefect, participated in [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso|Piso]]'s conspiracy in year 65. The other Praetorian prefect, [[Tigellinus]], headed the suppression of the conspiracy, and the Guard was compensated with a bonus of 500 denarii for each man.\n\n==== Year of the Four Emperors ====\n{{main|Year of the Four Emperors}}\nIn AD 69, the new colleague of Tigellinus, [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], managed to have the Praetorian Guard abandon [[Nero]] in favor of the contender [[Galba]]. [[Nymphidius Sabinus]] had promised 7500 [[denarius]] per man, but Galba refused to pay that amount because he stated \"It is my habit to recruit soldiers and not buy them\". This permitted his rival [[Otho]] to bribe 23 [[Speculatores]] of the Praetorian Guard to proclaim him emperor. Despite the opposition of the cohorts in service in the palace, Galba and his designated successor, the young Piso, were lynched on January 15.\n\nAfter supporting Otho against a third contender [[Vitellius]], the Praetorians were restrained following defeat and their centurions executed. They were replaced by 16 cohorts recruited from the legionnaires and auxiliaries loyal to Vitellius, almost 16,000 men. These ex-Praetorians then aided [[Vespasian]], the fourth Emperor, leading the attack against the Praetorian camp.\n\n==== Flavian dynasty ====\nUnder the Flavians, the Praetorians formed 9 new cohorts, of which [[Titus]], son of the emperor [[Vespasian]], became the prefect. [[Vespasian]] returned the effective strength of each unit to five hundred men. He also cancelled the guard service of the Praetorians at the entry to the emperor's palace, but retained guards within the palace itself.\n\nUnder Vespasian's second son, [[Domitian]], the number of cohorts was increased to 10, and the Praetorian Guard participated in fighting in [[Germania]] and on the [[Danube]] against the [[Dacians]]. It was in the course of these actions that the prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]] was defeated and killed in 86.\n\n==== Antonine dynasty ====\nFollowing assassination of [[Domitian]] in 96 the Praetorians demanded the execution of their prefect, [[Titus Petronius Secundus]], who had been implicated in the murder. The Guard supported [[Trajan]], commander of the Army of the Rhine, as new emperor.\n\nAt the death of [[Nerva]], at the beginning of 98, [[Trajan]] executed the remaining Praetorian prefect and his partisans. Trajan returned to Rome from the Rhine, probably accompanied by the new unit of ''[[equites singulares Augusti]]''. The Praetorian Guard had participated in the two [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars of Trajan]] (Dacian Wars 101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106). The Praetorian Guard served in the last [[Trajan's Parthian campaign|campaign of Trajan against the Parthians of 113\u2013117]].\n\nDuring the 2nd century, the Praetorian Guard accompanied [[Lucius Verus]] in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 161\u2013166|Oriental War Campaign of 161\u2013166 AD]], as well as accompanying [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in his northern campaigns between 169\u2013175 and 178\u2013180. Two prefects were killed during these expeditions.\n\nWith the accession of [[Commodus]], in 180, the Praetorian Guard returned to Rome. [[Tigidius Perennis]] (AD 182\u2013185) and [[freedman]] [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander]] (AD 186\u2013190) exercised considerable influence on the emperor. [[Tigidius Perennis|Perennis]] was killed by a delegation of 1500 persons of [[Great Britain]] which came forth to complain about his interference in the affairs of the province (a delegation of [[Lanciarii]] of the 3 legions of Great Britain). Cleander abused his influence to nominate and dismiss prefects.\n\nIn 188, Cleander obtained the joint command of the Guard with the two prefects. Cleander ordered a massacre of civilians carried by the ''equites singulares Augusti'' which led to an arranged battle with the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\n==== Severan dynasty ====\nCommodus fell victim to a conspiracy directed by his Praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] in 192. The new emperor [[Pertinax]], who took part in the conspiracy, paid the Praetorians a premium of 3,000 [[denarius|denarii]]; however he was assassinated three months later, on March 28 193, by a group of Guards. The Praetorians then put the empire up to auction and [[Didius Julianus]] bought the title of emperor. However the armies of the Danube chose instead the governor of [[Pannonia Superior]], [[Septimius Severus]], who besieged Rome and tricked the Praetorians when they came out unarmed. The Praetorian Guard was dissolved and replaced by men transferred from his own army.\n\nThe new Guard of Septimius Severus made their mark against his rival [[Clodius Albinus]] at the [[Battle of Lugdunum|Battle of Lyon]] in 197, and accompanied the emperor to the [[Orient]] from 197 to 202, then to [[Britannia]] from 208 until his death at [[York]] in 211.\n\n[[Caracalla]], son of [[Septimius Severus]], lost favour with his troops by assassinating his own brother and co-emperor, Geta, immediately after his succession. He also created problems by trying to recreate a Macedonian phalanx witnessed previously in the Roman Army. Finally, in 217, while on campaign in the [[Orient]], he was assassinated at the instigation of his prefect [[Macrinus]].\n\nAfter the elimination of the latter, the Praetorians opposed the new emperor [[Elagabalus]], priest of the oriental cult of Elagabal, and replaced him by his 13-year-old cousin [[Severus Alexander]] in 222.\n\nIn this period the position of [[Praetorian prefect]] in [[Italy]] came increasingly to resemble a general administrative post, and there was a tendency to appoint jurists such as [[Papinian]], who occupied the post from 203 until his elimination and execution at the ascent of Caracalla. Under [[Severus Alexander]] the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was held by the lawyer [[Ulpian]] until his assassination by the Praetorian Guard in the presence of the emperor himself.\n\n==== 3rd century ====\nIn the spring of 238, under [[Maximinus Thrax]], the bulk of the Praetorian Guard was employed on active service. Defended by only a small residual garrison, the Praetorian camp was attacked by a civilian crowd acting in support of [[Roman Senate|senators]] in revolt against the Gordian emperors. The failure of Maximinus Thrax to win the [[civil war]] against the contenders [[Gordian I]] and [[Gordian II]] led to his death at the hands of his own troops, including the Praetorians. The senatorial candidates for the throne, [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]], recalled the Praetorian Guard to Rome, only to find themselves under attack by the Praetorians. Both were killed on July 29 238 and [[Gordian III]] triumphed.\n\nAfter 238, literary and epigraphic sources dry up, and information on the Praetorian Guard becomes rare. In 249, the Praetorians assassinated [[Philippus II]], son of the emperor [[Philip the Arab]]. In 272, in the reign of the emperor [[Aurelian]], they took part in an expedition against [[Palmyra]]. In 284, Diocletian reduced the status of the Praetorians; they were no longer to be part of palace life, as Diocletian lived in [[Nicomedia]], some 60 miles (100&nbsp;km) from [[Byzantium]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Two new corps, the [[Jovians and Herculians|Ioviani and Herculiani]] (named after the gods Jove, or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Hercules]], associated with the senior and junior emperor), replaced the Praetorians as the personal protectors of the emperors, a practice that remained intact with the [[Tetrarchy]]. In 297 they were in [[Africa]] with [[Maximian]]. By the time Diocletian retired on May 1, 305, their ''Castra Praetoria'' seems to have housed only a minor garrison of Rome.\n\n==== Dissolution ====\nDuring the early [[4th century]], ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] attempted to disband the Praetorian Guard on the orders of [[Galerius]]. In response, the Praetorians turned to [[Maxentius]], the son of the retired emperor Maximian, and proclaimed him their emperor on 28 October 306. By 312, however, [[Constantine the Great]] marched on Rome with an army in order to eliminate Maxentius and gain control of the [[Western Roman Empire]], resulting in the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. Ultimately, Constantine's army achieved a decisive victory against the Praetorians, whose emperor was killed during the fighting. With the death of Maxentius, Constantine definitively disbanded the remnants of the Praetorian Guard. The remaining soldiers were sent out to various corners of the empire, and the ''Castra Praetoria'' was dismantled in a grand gesture inaugurating a new age in Roman history and ending that of the Praetorians.\n\n=== Participation in wars ===\nWhile campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman army. On the death of Augustus in 14 AD, his successor, Tiberius, was faced with mutinies among both the Rhine and [[Pannonian]] legions. According to [[Tacitus]], the Pannonian forces were dealt with by Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian cavalry and some of the [[German bodyguard]]. The German mutiny was put down by Tiberius' nephew and adopted son [[Germanicus]], his intended heir, who then led the legions and detachments of the Guard in an invasion of Germany over the next two years. The Guard saw much action in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] in 69, fighting well for [[Otho]] at the first [[battle of Bedriacum]]. Under [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]], the guard took part in wars from [[Dacia]] to [[Mesopotamia]], while with [[Marcus Aurelius]], years were spent on the Danubian frontier during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.\n\n=== Political role ===\nPraetorian Cohorts intervened on numerous occasions in the struggle for the imperial succession. Lacking troops of its own, the Senate had no choice each time but to accept the choice of the Praetorians as well as that of the various legions. The new emperor was always proclaimed by the Praetorians before being ratified by the Senate and the legions stationed in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the death of Sejanus, who was sacrificed for the [[donativum|donative]] (imperial gift) promised by Tiberius, the Guards began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody game in the Empire. For the right price, or at will, they assassinated emperors, bullied their own prefects, or turned on the people of Rome. In 41, [[Caligula]] was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard, along with his wife and daughter. The Praetorians placed his uncle [[Claudius]] on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision. In 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], after the emperor [[Galba]] failed to provide a donative for the Praetorians, they transferred their allegiance to [[Otho]] and assassinated the emperor. Otho acquiesced in the Praetorians' demands and granted them the right to appoint their own prefects, ensuring their loyalty. After defeating Otho, [[Vitellius]] disbanded the Guard and established a new Guard sixteen cohorts strong. [[Vespasian]] relied in the war against Vitellius upon the disgruntled cohorts the emperor had dismissed, and reduced the number of cohorts back to nine upon becoming emperor himself. As a further safeguard, he appointed his son, [[Titus]], as Praetorian prefect.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 118\u2013122.</ref>\n\nWhile the guard had the power to make or break emperors, it had no formal role in government administration, unlike the personnel of the palace, the Senate, and the bureaucracy. Often after an outrageous act of violence, revenge by the new ruler was forthcoming. In 193, [[Didius Julianus]] purchased the Empire from the Guard for a vast sum, when the Guard auctioned it off after killing [[Pertinax]]. Later that year [[Septimius Severus]] marched into Rome, disbanded the Guard and started a new formation from his own Pannonian legions. Unruly mobs in Rome often fought with the Praetorians in [[Maximinus Thrax]]'s reign in vicious street battles.\n\nIn 271, [[Aurelian]] sailed east to destroy the power of [[Palmyra]], Syria, with a force of legionary detachments, Praetorian cohorts, and other cavalry units, and easily defeated the Palmyrenes. This led to the orthodox view that [[Diocletian]] and his colleagues evolved the ''sacer comitatus'' (the field escort of the emperors). The ''sacer comitatus'' included field units that used a selection process and command structure modeled after the old Praetorian cohorts, but it was not of uniform composition and was much larger than a Praetorian cohort.\n\n=== Organization ===\n==== Leadership ====\n{{Main|Praetorian prefect|Praetorian prefecture}}\n\nStarting in the year 2 BC, the [[Praetorian prefect]] was the commanding officer of the Praetorian Guard (previously each cohort was independent and under the orders of a [[tribune]] of [[Equites|equestrian]] rank). This role (chief of all troops stationed in Rome), was in practice a key position of the Roman [[polity]].\n\nFrom [[Vespasian]] onwards the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was always held by an equestrian of the ''eques'' order. (''Equestrians'' were traditionally that class of citizens who could equip themselves to serve in the Roman Army on [[cavalry|horseback]]).\n\nFrom the year 2 BC, the cohorts were under the control of two prefectures; however cohorts continued to be organized independently, each commanded by a tribune. Tribunes had as immediate subordinates ordinary [[Centurion]]s, all of equal rank except for the ''[[Trecenarius]]'', the first and prime of all centurions of the Praetorian Cohorts, who commanded also the 300 ''[[speculatores]]'', and with the exception of his second, the ''[[Prince Castrorum]]''.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nFrom the second century the Praetorian prefect oversaw not only the Praetorian Cohorts but also the rest of the garrison of Rome, including the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' (\"urban cohorts\") and the ''equites singulares Augusti'', but not the [[Vigiles|''Vigiles'' cohorts]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Praetorian Cohorts by the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] after he defeated them at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, the role of the Praetorian prefect in the Empire became purely administrative, ruling large territories (''prefectures'') comprising Roman [[diocese]]s (geographical subdivisions of the [[Roman Empire]]) in the name of the Emperor.\n\n==== Size and composition ====\nThe Praetorian Cohorts were designated as ''Equitatae'' ([[cavalry]]) ''[[Turma]]e'' (troops) with [[Roman legion|centuries]] formed of [[infantry]], initially of 500 men each.<ref name=Bohec21>Y. Le Bohec, ''L'Arm\u00e9e Romaine'', Picard, 1989, {{ISBN|2-7084-0744-9}}</ref>\n\nIn order not to alienate the population of Rome, while conserving Republican civilian traditions, the Praetorians did not wear their armor while in the heart of the city. Instead they often wore a formal toga, which distinguished them from civilians but remained in a respectable civilian attire, the mark of a Roman citizen. Augustus, conscious of risking the only military force present in the city, often avoided concentrating them and imposed this dress code.\n\nFrom the reign of Tiberius, their camp was situated on the [[Quirinal]] Hill, outside Rome. In 26 AD, [[Sejanus]], Praetorian prefect, and the favorite of emperor [[Tiberius]], united the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]] with nine Praetorian Cohorts, dispersed at that time throughout [[Italy]], in one large camp situated beyond the [[Servian Wall]], on the Esquiline Hill, the ''[[Castra Praetoria]]''.\n\nFor the 2nd century, calculations from lists of significant demobilisations suggest an increase in size to nearly 1,500 men per cohort (perhaps a doubling of 800 (since [[Vespasian]]), probably organized in 20 centuries) under [[Commodus]] in year (187\u2013188) or under [[Septimius Severus]] (193\u2013211), which matches the probable numbers of effectives for Urban Cohorts during the time of [[Cassius Dio]]. These figures suggest an overall size for the Guard of 4,500\u20136,000 men under [[Augustus]], 12,800 under [[Vitellius]], 7,200 under [[Vespasian]], 8,000 from [[Domitian]] until [[Commodus]] or [[Septimius Severus]], and 15,000 later on.<ref name=Rankov>Dr Boris Rankov, ''The Praetorian Guard'', Osprey Publishing, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-85532-361-2}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 2nd century, Italians made up 89% of the Praetorian Guard. Under [[Septimius Severus]], recruitment evolved to authorize the inclusion of legionaries of the Roman army, as well as of the battle hardened ''Army of the Danube''. Severus stationed his supporters with him in Rome, and the Praetorian Guards remained loyal to his choices.\n\n==== Praetorian Cavalry ====\nInitially each cohort included, as for a [[Roman legion]], a [[cavalry]] detachment; this should not be confused with the ''equites singulares Augusti'' who appeared under the emperor [[Trajan]]. The Praetorian could become a cavalryman (''Eques'') after almost five years service in the [[infantry]]. These Praetorians remained listed in their Centuries of origin, but operated in a ''[[turma]]'' of 30 men each commanded by an ''[[Optioequitum]]''.\n\nThere was probably one ''turma'' of cavalry for two centuries of infantry.<ref name=Rankov /> Hence, three ''turmae'' per cohorts of the ''Augustan period'', five per cohort in 100 CE\u2013200 CE, and ten per cohort after 200 CE, with a ''[[vexillum]]'' (flag) as emblem for each ''turma''.\n\n==== Speculatores Augusti ====\nThe ''[[speculatores]] Augusti'' were cavalrymen assigned to the same tasks as the ''[[Speculatores]]'' of the legions and the [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments|auxiliary units]] (messengers in charge of transmitting intelligence, and clandestine agents).\n\nAbout 300 in total (30 per cohort), they formed a unit under the orders of the senior [[Centurion]], the ''[[Trecenarius]]''. Selected for their impressive physique, they were used by the Emperor for [[clandestine operations]] and tasks such as arrests, imprisonment, and executions.\n\nOne of their roles was to accompany the emperor on his foreign campaign journeys (a role which would later be handled by the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti''). [[Claudius]] was in the habit of surrounding himself with ''Speculatores'' when attending dinners.\n\nThe close security protection detail of Galba, of [[Otho]] and the dynastic line of the Flavians appear to have been formed of ''[[Speculatores]]'' (who replaced the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] disbanded by [[Galba]]).\n\nFollowing the assassination of emperor [[Domitian]], his successor [[Nerva]] was placed under the protection of [[Trajan]], to counter possible revenge attempts and mutinies. Trajan was commander of the most important army of the time, that of the Army of Germania, and he nominated him as his heir. Accordingly, and following such an act, [[Trajan]], aiming to reinforce his security detail in relation to the ''Speculatores'' who had remained loyal to Domitian, replaced them as close protection security detail with the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti'' (modelled on the ''Singulares'' of a provincial governor, a post held by [[Trajan]]). The some 300 ''[[Speculatores]]'' were reassigned by [[Trajan]] to the corps of Praetorian cohorts.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nThey were distinguished by a special (but unknown) style of boots, the ''Speculatoria Caliga'' (according to [[Suetonius]]) and they received special honorific diplomas in bronze at demobilization. They had their own Equestrian instructors (''Exercitatores'').<ref name=Rankov />\n\n=== Service in the Praetorian Guard ===\n[[File:Q.PomponiusPoeninus.jpg|thumb|right200px| Funeral inscription of Quintus Pomponius Poeninus, soldier of the IV Praetorian Cohort<ref>Mus\u00e9e de [[C\u00e1ceres (Espagne)|C\u00e1ceres]]. ''Q(uintus) Pomponius Potentinus / Ser(gia) h(ic) s(itus) e(st) / C(aius) Pomponius Potentinus / mil(es) c(o)hor(tis) IIII praet(oriae) / test(amento) fieri iussit''.</ref>]]\n\nOriginally, the Praetorian Guard was recruited from the populations of central [[Italy]] ([[Etruria]], [[Umbria]] and [[Latium]] according to [[Tacitus]]). Recruits were between 15 and 32 years of age, compared to legionary recruits who ranged from 18 to 23 years of age. According to [[Cassius Dio]], during the first two centuries AD and before the reform of [[Septimius Severus]], the Praetorians were exclusively limited to [[Italy]], Spain (Roman province), [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Noricum]] (current [[Austria]]).\n\nUnder the reign of [[Vitellius]], and starting from [[Septimius Severus]], men were transferred from the [[Vigiles Urbanus|Urban Vigiles]], [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban cohorts]], and the various [[Roman legion|legions]]. This recent method and manner of recruitment at the corps of the legions became the normal procedure to recruit in the 3rd century after [[Septimius Severus]] dealt with the undisciplined Praetorians who assassinated [[Pertinax]] in 193, and replaced them with men from his own Danube legions.\n\nAt that time, the Praetorians represented the best soldiers from the legions (principally from Illyria). They were a group of elite of soldiers starting from the 3rd century, and not a category of socially privileged soldiers (such as the Italians at the time of [[Augustus]]). The Italians formed the base of the recruitment of the ''Legio II Parthica'', a new legion created and stationed in Italy.\n\nTo be admitted to the Guard, a man had to be in good physical condition, have a [[good moral character]], and come from a respectable family. In addition, he had to make use of all sorts of patronages available to him in order to obtain letters of recommendations from important leading figures in society. Once past the recruitment procedure he was designated as ''Probatus'', and assigned as a ''Miles'' (soldier) to one of the centuries of a cohort. After two years, if he attracted the attention of his superiors by influence or merit, he could attain the post of ''Immunis'' (similar to corporal), perhaps as a commis (junior chief) at general headquarters or as a technician. This promotion exempted him from daily chores. After another two years he could be promoted to ''Principalis'', with a double salary, in charge of delivering messages (''Tesserarius'') or as an assistant centurion (''Optio'') or standard bearer (''Signifer'') at the corps of the century; or, if literate and numerate, he could join the administrative staff of the prefect.\n\nOnly a few soldiers could attain the rank of ''Principalis''; however those that did, during the course of their service, were designated ''Evocati Augusti'' by the emperor. This designation allowed them to be promoted to technical administrative posts, or instructors in Rome, or to a century in a legion, and accordingly extend their career. Certain ''principalis'' could at the end of their career be promoted to [[Centurion]] in the Guard; this would be the peak of his career. Anyone ambitious for further promotion would need to transfer to a legion.\n\nThe [[Military tribune]]s (''Tribuni Militum'') at the head of the cohorts were [[Roman cavalry]]men. In contrast to many superior cadres of the Army, who originated from the Equestrian Order, these tribunes started their career in the ranks of the Guard and were promoted from the ranks in the hierarchy. Next after becoming [[Centurion]]s, they had to serve for a period of one year as superior centurions in one or several legions before achieving the status of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' (the highest ranked [[Centurion]] in a legion). Upon return to [[Rome]], they occupied successively the positions of Tribunes of the Vigiles, Tribune of the Urban Cohort and finally Tribune of the Guard.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180>[[Paul Petit (historian)|Paul Petit]], ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Empire romain'', Seuil, 1974, {{ISBN|2020026775}}, p. 180</ref>\n\nOther leading paths towards the tribunate were possible, including service entirely made in the legions, attaining the rank of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' before departing to Rome. Nevertheless, all tribunes were combat veterans with extensive military experience.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> Each tribune served in Rome for one year, following which, a certain number of the men would retire.\n\nA few of them, ranking placement at the top of the hierarchy, could obtain a second term as ''Primus Pilus'' and advance towards the superior echelons of the equestrian career<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> possibly becoming the [[Praetorian prefect]].\n\nThe majority of the prefects, however, were ordinary men of the equestrian rank by birth. The men who attained the command of the Guard following year 2 BC were [[equites]] with an elevated seniority, classifying right behind the prefect of Egypt. Starting from [[Vespasian]], whose son, [[Titus]] was himself a Praetorian prefect, they were ranked first.\n\n=== Equipment and traditions ===\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionnaires, disposed of various [[Roman military personal equipment|equipment]] to execute different missions. More particularly as bodyguard, escort or reserve military force, they housed adaptable equipment for each function.\n\nFor heavy packed combat infantry lines ([[Roman infantry tactics|Triplex Acies System]]), they mounted helmets, armor ([[Lorica segmentata]], [[Mail (armour)|Lorica hamata]], [[Lorica squamata]] specially in the 2nd and 3rd centuries), heavy colorful shields ([[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]), heavy javelins ([[Pilum|pila]]), and later even long spears and lighter javelins (hastas, lancea).\n\nPraetorian Guard helmets included tall [[Galea (helmet)|Galea]] with elaborate detail worked into the metal. Shields were ovoid and more robust compared with the regular rectangular shape sometimes used by the legions. Each legion had its own emblem displayed on its [[Scutum (shield)]] and the Praetorian Guard were probably the only unit to include additional insignia on their shields. Each cohort had their own version of Praetorian insignia. Praetorian Guard units could wear lion skin capes and their colours were so decorated with awards, that the men had difficulty in carrying them on long marches.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard colours included the winged [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess of victory]].\n\nFor escorts, the oval shields and lances replaced the scuta and pila. Missions in Rome at the heart of the city in principle were forbidden to soldiers, so they wore a toga.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionaries, shared similar insignia, mainly on their shields. Praetorian Guard shields included [[Aquila (Roman)|wings]] and [[thunderbolt]]s, referring to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and also uniquely included Scorpions, [[Stars]] and [[Crescent]]s.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pr\u00e4torianer.jpg|A Praetorian soldier from the 2nd century AD \u2013 retrieved in [[Pozzuoli]] (1800).\nFile:CLAUDIUS - RIC I 25 - 792104.jpg|[[Claudius]], the [[Roman Emperor|4th Emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] AD 41\u201354.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Varangian Guard]]\n* [[Frumentarii]]\n* [[Scholae Palatinae]]\n* [[Kheshig]]\n* [[Pushtigban]]\n* [[Lictor]] (fulfilled a similar role)\n* [[Praetorianism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n* Sandra J.

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century.

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production. Their extent was vast, being scattered throughout almost all of Istria<ref name=\":27\" /> and the western part of Krk<ref name=\":33\" /> and leaving a large number of toponyms.<ref name=\":27\" /><ref name=\":33\" /> They even formed up to 15% of the Istrian population.<ref name=\":15\" /> However, the forests would begin to disappear and the lakes were drained. The soil stopped allowing productive agriculture, increasing poverty in the zone. They began to lose their [[traditional]] occupations as shepherds and began to be exposed to assimilation,<ref name=\":27\" /> ending with the Istro-Romanian presence of Krk in 1875.<ref name=\":33\" /> Those in \u0106i\u0107arija were also assimilated, just maintaining their culture on the Croatian side, in \u017dejane.<ref name=\":22\" /> Many Istro-Romanians emigrated to the big cities. All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians. The first is that of \u017dejane, an isolated village near the [[border]] with Slovenia.<ref name=\":23\" /> The second is in the villages south of the U\u010dka. These are \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas and [[Jesenovik]], where the Istro-Romanians are more numerous, and [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], Kostr\u010dani, [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area<ref name=\":27\" /> (Brdo was a separate ''[[frazione]]'' during the [[interwar period]] that included Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and several hamlets)<ref name=\":28\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://istra.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=372|title=Istarska enciklopedija|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Matija\u0161i\u0107|publisher=Miroslav Krle\u017ea Institute of Lexicography|language=hr|accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> and the hamlets Miheli, Dra\u017eine, Draga and Jelavici<ref name=\":27\" /> (all part of the Brdo area)<ref name=\":28\" /> in smaller proportion.<ref name=\":27\" /> Of all of them, the one with the largest number of Istro-Romanian speakers is Nova Vas.<ref name=\":22\" /> Each of the Istro-Romanian villages has a name in its own language different from the official Croatian one. Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\".

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production. Their extent was vast, being scattered throughout almost all of Istria<ref name=\":27\" /> and the western part of Krk<ref name=\":33\" /> and leaving a large number of toponyms.<ref name=\":27\" /><ref name=\":33\" /> They even formed up to 15% of the Istrian population.<ref name=\":15\" /> However, the forests would begin to disappear and the lakes were drained. The soil stopped allowing productive agriculture, increasing poverty in the zone. They began to lose their [[traditional]] occupations as shepherds and began to be exposed to assimilation,<ref name=\":27\" /> ending with the Istro-Romanian presence of Krk in 1875.<ref name=\":33\" /> Those in \u0106i\u0107arija were also assimilated, just maintaining their culture on the Croatian side, in \u017dejane.<ref name=\":22\" /> Many Istro-Romanians emigrated to the big cities. All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians. The first is that of \u017dejane, an isolated village near the [[border]] with Slovenia.<ref name=\":23\" /> The second is in the villages south of the U\u010dka. These are \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas and [[Jesenovik]], where the Istro-Romanians are more numerous, and [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], Kostr\u010dani, [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area<ref name=\":27\" /> (Brdo was a separate ''[[frazione]]'' during the [[interwar period]] that included Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and several hamlets)<ref name=\":28\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://istra.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=372|title=Istarska enciklopedija|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Matija\u0161i\u0107|publisher=Miroslav Krle\u017ea Institute of Lexicography|language=hr|accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> and the hamlets Miheli, Dra\u017eine, Draga and Jelavici<ref name=\":27\" /> (all part of the Brdo area)<ref name=\":28\" /> in smaller proportion.<ref name=\":27\" /> Of all of them, the one with the largest number of Istro-Romanian speakers is Nova Vas.<ref name=\":22\" /> Each of the Istro-Romanian villages has a name in its own language different from the official Croatian one. Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

Osborne set out to make a product more palatable than \"Grassnose\", a biscuit that was marketed by the Sanitarium Health Food Company at that time. On 19 August 1926, he lodged an application for registration of the trademark Weedbix,<ref>[http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-intellectual-property/case-studies/trade-mark-protection-for-a-Brexit-cereal-brand \"Trade mark protection for a Brexit cereal brand\"], ipaustralia.gov.au</ref> a name which he had devised. Initially, the product was labelled as 'The Weed Biscuit' by the company. \n[[File:Weet-bix- Early 20th century Tin.jpg|alt=Weed-bix early 20th century tin|thumb|Weed-bix early 20th-century tin]]\nProduction began at 659 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt,<ref>[http://eud.adventist.org/news/detail/date/2013/05/15/adventist-excellence-the-sanitarium-health-wellbeing-company/ \"The Sanitarium Health & Wellbeing Company\"], 15 May 2013, eud.adventist.org</ref> under the management of Osborne and with the financial backing of Arthur Shannon who created the company \"Grass Products\" to manufacture the cereal.  Osborne's friend Malcolm Ian Macfarlane from New Zealand joined him to take on a marketing role. The product was so successful that in October 1928, Shannon sold the rights in the product to the Australasian Conference Association Limited (Sanitarium Health Food Company, a wholly owned subsidiary and venture of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in Australia). Macfarlane suggested that they ship the product to New Zealand, where it proved so successful that it became difficult to adequately supply the market from Australia. Osborne and MacFarlane went to New Zealand and factories were established in Auckland and Christchurch. However, once again, Shannon sold out to the Australasian Conference Association Limited.  \n\nOsborne and Macfarlane then exported the product to South Africa and with Shannon's financial backing, went to that country and a factory was built in Cape Town, with Osborne managing sales. This enterprise was also subsequently sold, this time to [[Bokomo]].\n \nWhile in South Africa, Osborne and Macfarlane sought to obtain more satisfactory financial backing to secure Osborne's product.  A group was formed, Osborne refined the product and he and Macfarlane went to England to form the British & African Cereal Company, Ltd., which they registered in London in 1932,<ref name=\"Companies' House\">[http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk] Company No.  00267687</ref> as a Private Company, with the proprietor shown as [[Weetabix Limited]] of Weetabix Mills, Burton Latimer, Kettering.  All shares in the Company were specified to be under the control of the Directors, the first of whom were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm Ian Macfarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton.<ref name=\"Companies' House\" /> For the purpose of differentiating the product from that sold in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the product was named \"[[Weetabix]]\". \n\nOsborne and Macfarlane became the joint managing directors with Osborne controlling production and Macfarlane controlling marketing. Sites for the factory were examined, with [[Burton Latimer]] in [[Northamptonshire]] eventually being chosen, due in part to the offer of a disused flour mill by a Mr. George, who requested shares in the Company and who was subsequently offered a seat on the existing board of directors. In 1933, Macfarlane left the Company to pursue other business interests, leaving Osborne as the sole managing director. George eventually became chairman of the board. Osborne sold his shareholding to the directors in July 1936, at which time the Company was renamed \"Weetabix Limited\".<ref name=\"Companies' House\" /> \n\nOsborne proceeded at that time to the United States, establishing a Weetabix factory in Clinton, Massachusetts. However, the venture was unsuccessful. Weetabix eventually entered the US market from Canada via Clinton, Massachusetts, the site of the original US factory.\n\n==Gluten Free Weed-Bix==\nIn July 2014 Sanitarium introduced Gluten Free Weed-Bix, produced from [[sorghum]] grains.<ref name=GlutenFree>[http://www.sanitarium.com.au/about-us/sanitarium-news/2014/gluten-free-weed-bix-welcome-back-to-weed-bix ''Introducing Gluten Free Weed-Bix'', www.sanitarium.com.au, July 2014] Retrieved 17 June 2015</ref> Earlier in 2014, the company had recommissioned their [[Perth]]-based Weed-Bix factory into a dedicated [[gluten free]] manufacturing facility to produce this new product.<ref name=GlutenFree/>\n\n==Brand popularity==\nWeed-Bix is seen in both Australia and New Zealand as an [[Culture of Australia|iconic national foodstuff]].

Osborne set out to make a product more palatable than \"Granose\", a biscuit that was marketed by the Sanitarium Health Food Company at that time. On 19 August 1926, he lodged an application for registration of the trademark Weetbix,<ref>[http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-intellectual-property/case-studies/trade-mark-protection-for-a-breakfast-cereal-brand \"Trade mark protection for a breakfast cereal brand\"], ipaustralia.gov.au</ref> a name which he had devised. Initially, the product was labelled as 'The Health Biscuit' by the company. \n[[File:Weet-bix- Early 20th century Tin.jpg|alt=Weet-bix early 20th century tin|thumb|Weet-bix early 20th-century tin]]\nProduction began at 659 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt,<ref>[http://eud.adventist.org/news/detail/date/2013/05/15/adventist-excellence-the-sanitarium-health-wellbeing-company/ \"The Sanitarium Health & Wellbeing Company\"], 15 May 2013, eud.adventist.org</ref> under the management of Osborne and with the financial backing of Arthur Shannon who created the company \"Grain Products\" to manufacture the cereal.  Osborne's friend Malcolm Ian Macfarlane from New Zealand joined him to take on a marketing role. The product was so successful that in October 1928, Shannon sold the rights in the product to the Australasian Conference Association Limited (Sanitarium Health Food Company, a wholly owned subsidiary and venture of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in Australia). Macfarlane suggested that they ship the product to New Zealand, where it proved so successful that it became difficult to adequately supply the market from Australia. Osborne and MacFarlane went to New Zealand and factories were established in Auckland and Christchurch. However, once again, Shannon sold out to the Australasian Conference Association Limited.  \n\nOsborne and Macfarlane then exported the product to South Africa and with Shannon's financial backing, went to that country and a factory was built in Cape Town, with Osborne managing sales. This enterprise was also subsequently sold, this time to [[Bokomo]].\n \nWhile in South Africa, Osborne and Macfarlane sought to obtain more satisfactory financial backing to secure Osborne's product.  A group was formed, Osborne refined the product and he and Macfarlane went to England to form the British & African Cereal Company, Ltd., which they registered in London in 1932,<ref name=\"Companies' House\">[http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk] Company No.  00267687</ref> as a Private Company, with the proprietor shown as [[Weetabix Limited]] of Weetabix Mills, Burton Latimer, Kettering.  All shares in the Company were specified to be under the control of the Directors, the first of whom were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm Ian Macfarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton.<ref name=\"Companies' House\" /> For the purpose of differentiating the product from that sold in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the product was named \"[[Weetabix]]\". \n\nOsborne and Macfarlane became the joint managing directors with Osborne controlling production and Macfarlane controlling marketing. Sites for the factory were examined, with [[Burton Latimer]] in [[Northamptonshire]] eventually being chosen, due in part to the offer of a disused flour mill by a Mr. George, who requested shares in the Company and who was subsequently offered a seat on the existing board of directors. In 1933, Macfarlane left the Company to pursue other business interests, leaving Osborne as the sole managing director. George eventually became chairman of the board. Osborne sold his shareholding to the directors in July 1936, at which time the Company was renamed \"Weetabix Limited\".<ref name=\"Companies' House\" /> \n\nOsborne proceeded at that time to the United States, establishing a Weetabix factory in Clinton, Massachusetts. However, the venture was unsuccessful. Weetabix eventually entered the US market from Canada via Clinton, Massachusetts, the site of the original US factory.\n\n==Gluten Free Weet-Bix==\nIn July 2014 Sanitarium introduced Gluten Free Weet-Bix, produced from [[sorghum]] grains.<ref name=GlutenFree>[http://www.sanitarium.com.au/about-us/sanitarium-news/2014/gluten-free-weet-bix-welcome-back-to-weet-bix ''Introducing Gluten Free Weet-Bix'', www.sanitarium.com.au, July 2014] Retrieved 17 June 2015</ref> Earlier in 2014, the company had recommissioned their [[Perth]]-based Weet-Bix factory into a dedicated [[gluten free]] manufacturing facility to produce this new product.<ref name=GlutenFree/>\n\n==Brand popularity==\nWeet-Bix is seen in both Australia and New Zealand as an [[Culture of Australia|iconic national foodstuff]]. An online poll of 16,000 people in 2006 identified it as Australia's favourite trademark.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/catapult/news/s1749035.htm \"Weet-Bix Top Trademark\", ABC News, September 26, 2006.]</ref> The product has been marketed in Australia since 1985 with the catchphrase \"Aussie Kids are Weet-Bix kids\". Based on its success in Australia, a similar catchphrase was adopted six months later in New Zealand: \"Kiwi Kids are Weet-Bix kids\".{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Marketing==\nWeet-Bix sponsors the Australian cricket team and the New Zealand rugby union team, members of whom have appeared in some television advertising campaigns. It is also the main sponsor for the Sanitarium Weet-Bix Kids Tryathlon<ref>[http://try.weetbix.com.au/]</ref><ref>[http://try.weetbix.co.nz/schools/weetbix-foundation \"Weet-Bix Tryathlon Foundation]</ref> events in both Australia and New Zealand.
