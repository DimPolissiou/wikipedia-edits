Located on the southern end of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] within the eastern edge of the [[Adirondack Park]], the village and surrounding area were on the route between the [[British people|British]] and [[French people|French]] colonies, and were often traversed by military forces during the Colonial wars. A reconstruction of [[Fort William Henry]], which replaces the original burned during the [[French and Indian War]], is within the village and serves as a living museum.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 19th century the area began to become an important tourist destination. [[Railroad]] tracks ran onto the [[steamboat]] docks on the south end of Lake George. From there steamboats ran several times a day to the hotels further north on the lake.  The [[Lake George Steamboat Company]] continues to operate steamboats out of Lake George.\n[[Image:Caldwell Village, New York.jpg|thumb|left|Village of Lake George in 1854]]\n\nThe Village of Lake George was incorporated in 1903. Besides the fort with its many associations, historic points of interest include the defunct [[railway station]] and [[Old Warren County Courthouse Complex|a 19th-century courthouse and jail]], now operated as a museum by the local historical society. The beach at one motel in the village features a plaque marking the site where the [[Marquis de Montcalm]] landed with his army preparatory to attacking the fort.

Located on the southern end of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] within the eastern edge of the [[Adirondack Park]], the village and surrounding area were on the route between the [[British people|British]] and [[French people|French]] colonies, and were often traversed by military forces during the Colonial wars. A reconstruction of [[Fort William Henry]], which replaces the original burned during the [[French and Indian War]], is within the village and serves as a living museum.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 19th century the area began to become an important tourist destination. [[Railroad]] tracks ran onto the [[steamboat]] docks on the south end of Lake George. From there steamboats ran several times a day to the hotels further north on the lake.  The [[Lake George Steamboat Company]] continues to operate steamboats out of Lake George.\n[[Image:Caldwell Village, New York.jpg|thumb|left|Village of Lake George in 1854]]\n\nThe Village of Lake George was incorporated in 1903. Besides the fort with its many associations, historic points of interest include the defunct [[railway station]] and [[Old Warren County Courthouse Complex|a 19th-century courthouse and jail]], now operated as a museum by the local historical society. The beach at one motel in the village features a plaque marking the site where the [[Marquis de Montcalm]] landed with his army preparatory to attacking the fort.

In the most common case, [[Incorporation (business)|incorporating]] a business, legal personality is usually acquired by registration with a [[government agency]] set up for the purpose. In other cases it may be by primary legislation: an example is the Charity Commission in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/50/part/2/chapter/1/crossheading/establishment-of-charity-commission/enacted|title=Charities Act 2006, s. 6|date=8 November 2006|website=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nAs legal personality is a prerequisite to [[legal capacity]] (the ability of any legal person to amend (enter into, transfer, etc.) rights and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), it is a prerequisite for an [[international organization]] to be able to sign [[international treaties]] in its own [[Legal name|name]].\n\nThe term \"legal person\" can be ambiguous because it is often used as a synonym of terms that refer ''only'' to non-human legal entities, specifically  in contradistinction to \"natural person\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thelawdictionary.org/juridical-person/|title=What is JURIDICAL PERSON? definition of JURIDICAL PERSON (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=19 October 2012|website=The Law Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_person|title=legal person|first=Elliott T.|last=Ash|date=4 May 2010|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n== Juridical persons ==\n{{Main article|Juridical person}}\n\n'''Artificial personality''', '''juridical personality''', or '''juristic personality''' is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of [[personhood]].\n\nA '''juridical''' or '''artificial''' person ({{lang-la|'''persona ficta'''}}; also juristic person) has a [[Legal name (business)|legal name]] and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability|liabilities]] in law, similar to those of a [[natural person]]. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental [[legal fiction]]. It is pertinent to the [[philosophy of law]], as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation ([[Corporate law|corporations law]]).\n\nJuridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (''universitas personarum'') to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its [[shareholder]]s). They may [[Lawsuit|sue and be sued]], enter contracts, incur [[debt]], and own [[property]]. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may [[Limited liability|shield its members]] from [[legal liability|personal liability]].\n\nIn some [[common law jurisdictions]] a distinction is drawn between ''corporation aggregate'' (such as a company, which is composed of a number of members) and a ''[[corporation sole]]'', which is a public office of '''legal personality''' separated from the individual holding the office; (both entities have separate legal personality).  Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the office of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is a corporation sole), but a [[Corporation sole#Examples of corporations sole in the United Kingdom|number of other public offices]] are now formed as corporations sole.\n\nThe concept of juridical personality is not absolute. \"[[Piercing the corporate veil]]\" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as [[Law of agency|agents]] involved in a [[corporate action|company action]] or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or [[public limited company]] are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or [[Board of directors#Directors|director]]s.\n\nThe concept of a juridical person is now central to [[Western law]] in both [[common law|common-law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3313312 The Juristic Person.

A [[corporation sole]] is a corporation constituted by a single member, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some [[legal benefit]] or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or [[The Crown]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by more than one member.\n**[[Municipality|Municipal corporations]] (municipalities) are \"creatures of [[statute]]\". Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons, including [[European economic interest grouping]]s (EEIGs).\n*[[Voluntary association|Unincorporated associations]], that is aggregates of two or more persons, are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions but not others.\n*[[Partnership]]s, an aggregate of two or more persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having an independent legal personality.\n*[[Company|Companies]], a form of [[Companies law|business association]] that carries on an industrial enterprise, are often corporations, although companies may take other forms, such as [[trade union]]s, [[Unlimited company|unlimited companies]], [[Investment trust|trusts]], and [[Mutual fund|funds]].

For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body which they are a part of.\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of legal personhood for organizations of people is at least as old as [[Ancient Rome]]: a variety of  [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegial institutions]] enjoyed the benefit under [[Roman law]].\n\nThe doctrine has been attributed to [[Pope Innocent IV]], who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of ''persona ficta'' as it is called in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]. In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the doctrine of ''[[Person (canon law)#Juridic persons|persona ficta]]'' allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty.  Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of [[delict]] due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-[[contract (canon law)|contractual obligations]] to surrounding communities.  This effectively moved such liability to persons acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since persons were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of negligence and able to be [[excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]].<ref>John Dewey, \u201cThe Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality,\u201d Yale Law Journal, Vol. XXXV, April 1926, pages 655\u2013673</ref>\n\nIn the common law tradition, only a person could possess legal rights. To allow them to function, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights\u2014the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Textbook on legal methods, legal systems and research|last=Kanti.|first=Saha, Tushar|isbn=9788175348936|oclc=892043129|year = 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of [[personal jurisdiction]]). In ''Louisville, C. & C.R. Co. v. Letson'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is \"capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.\" Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that \"those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,\" should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.\n\n== Sample cases using the doctrine ==\n* In ''U.S. v. The Cooper Corp.'', (1941) the court held that the United States government, as a juristic person, could sue under the [[Sherman Act]]. Section 7 of the act granted the right to sue only to persons. The corporate defendant, which was accused of illegally conspiring and colluding to raise prices on [[tire]]s, argued that the U.S. government didn't have power to enforce the act because the government wasn't a person. The court held that the term \"person\" includes the U.S. Government, and allowed the action against the collusive corporations to continue.\n* In ''Cook County v. U.S. ex rel Chandler'', (2003) the County was accused of violating a law which forbids \"any person\" from falsely obtaining research funds from the government. The county received a $5 million grant, but used it to conduct inappropriate tests on human subjects. The county argued that it could not be held liable because it was not a person. The court held that the county could be sued under the law as a legal person.\n* In ''Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council'', (1993) the court declined to extend certain rights to legal persons. The association of prisoners sought to proceed ''[[in forma pauperis]].'' The court held that the right to sue ''in forma pauperis'' existed only for natural persons, not legal persons.\n\n== Extension of basic rights to legal persons ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe term juridical person (\"pessoa jur\u00eddica\" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is used in [[legal science]] for designating an entity with rights and liabilities which also has legal personality. Its regulations are largely based on Brazil's Civil Code, where it is distinctly recognized and defined, among other normative documents.\n\n[[Brazilian law]] recognizes any association or abstract entity as a juridical person, but a registry is required through a Constitutional Document, with specifications depending on the category of Juridical Person and local law of state and city.\n\n=== China ===\nFor a typical example of the concept of legal person in a civil law jurisdiction, under the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China|General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], Chapter III, Article 36., \"A legal person shall be an organization that has capacity for civil rights and capacity for civil conduct and independently enjoys civil rights and assumes civil obligations in accordance with the law.\"<ref>Gary J.

The non-human entities given the \"legal person\" status by the law ''\"have rights and co-relative duties; they can sue and be sued, can possess and transfer property\"''. Since these non-human entities are ''\"voiceless\"'' they are legally represented ''\"through guardians and representatives\"'' to claim their legal rights and to fulfill their legal duties and responsibilities. Specific non-human entities given the status of ''\"legal person\"'' include ''\"[[Corporate personhood|corporate personality]], [[body politic]], [[Charitable organization|charitable unions]] etc,\"'' as well as [[Trust_law#|trust estates]], [[deity]], temples, churches, mosques, hospitals, universities, colleges, banks, railways, municipalities, and gram panchayats (village councils), rivers, all animals and birds.<ref name=IndiaLaw>[https://qz.com/india/1636326/who-apart-from-human-beings-are-legal-persons-in-india/ Birds to holy rivers: A list of everything India considers \u201clegal persons\u201d], [[Quartz (publication)]], September 2019.</ref> \n\n====Corporates and trusts====\nIn court cases regarding corporate, the shareholders are not responsible for the company's debts but the company itself being a \"legal person\" is liable to repay those debts or be sued for the non-repayment of debts.<ref name=IndiaLaw/> \n\n====Animal kingdom====\nIn court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of ''\"legal person\"'' and humans have the [[Duty#Legal_duties|legal duty]] to act as \"[[In loco parentis|loco parentis]]\" towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children.

In another case, a court in [[Uttarakhand]] state mandated that animals have the same rights as humans. In another case of [[Cattle_theft_in_India#Cattle_smuggling_in_India|cow-smuggling]], the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] mandated that ''\"entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic\"'' species has a ''\"distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person\"'' and humans are ''\"loco parentis\"'' while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and [[Working_animal|load carrying animals]] must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope.<ref name=IndiaLaw/> \n\n====Religious deities and concept of Shebait====\n{{ anchor | Shebait | Shebaitship }}\n{{ see also |Hindu law}}\n\nIn court cases regarding religious entities, the [[deity]] (deity or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred) is also a ''\"legal person\"'' who can engage in legal cases through ''\"[[trustee]]s\"'' or ''\"[[Board of directors|managing board]] in charge of the temple\"''. [[Supreme Court of India]] (SC), while deciding [[Ayodhya_dispute#Title_cases|Ayodhya case]] of [[Ram Janmabhoomi]], decided in 2010 that the deity [[Rama]] in the specific temple was a \"legal entity\" entitled to be represented by own lawyer appointed by the trustees acting on behalf of the deity. Similarly, in 2018 SC decided that the deity [[Ayyappan]] is a ''\"legal person\"'' with ''\"[[Fundamental_rights_in_India#Right_to_privacy|the right to privacy]]\"'' in the court case regarding the [[entry of women to Sabarimala]] shrine of Lord Ayyapan.<ref name=IndiaLaw/>\n\n=====Shebaitship=====\nUnder the Indian law, the ''\"shebaitship\"'' is the property owned by the deity or idol as a \"legal person\". Human appointed to act on behalf of deity are called the ''\"shebait\"''. A shebait acts as the guardian or custodian of deity to protect the right of deity and fulfill the legal duties of the deity. Shebait is similar to a trustee in case the deity or temple does have a legally registered trust or entity. Under the [[Hindu Law]] property gifted or offered as rituals or donations, etc absolutely belongs to the deity and not to the shebait. Case example are ''\"Profulla Chrone Requitte vs Satya Chorone Requitte, AIR 1979 SC 1682 (1686): (1979) 3 SCC 409: (1979) 3 SCR 431.

''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter's comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that \"the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the [[equal protection]] of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\"\n\nLater opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision.<ref>See, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=147&invol=165 Noble v.

In the most common case, [[Incorporation (business)|incorporating]] a business, legal personality is usually acquired by registration with a [[government agency]] set up for the purpose. In other cases it may be by primary legislation: an example is the Charity Commission in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/50/part/2/chapter/1/crossheading/establishment-of-charity-commission/enacted|title=Charities Act 2006, s. 6|date=8 November 2006|website=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nAs legal personality is a prerequisite to [[legal capacity]] (the ability of any legal person to amend (enter into, transfer, etc.) rights and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), it is a prerequisite for an [[international organization]] to be able to sign [[international treaties]] in its own [[Legal name|name]].\n\nThe term \"legal person\" can be ambiguous because it is often used as a synonym of terms that refer ''only'' to non-human legal entities, specifically  in contradistinction to \"natural person\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thelawdictionary.org/juridical-person/|title=What is JURIDICAL PERSON? definition of JURIDICAL PERSON (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=19 October 2012|website=The Law Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_person|title=legal person|first=Elliott T.|last=Ash|date=4 May 2010|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n== Juridical persons ==\n{{Main article|Juridical person}}\n\n'''Artificial personality''', '''juridical personality''', or '''juristic personality''' is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of [[personhood]].\n\nA '''juridical''' or '''artificial''' person ({{lang-la|'''persona ficta'''}}; also juristic person) has a [[Legal name (business)|legal name]] and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability|liabilities]] in law, similar to those of a [[natural person]]. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental [[legal fiction]]. It is pertinent to the [[philosophy of law]], as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation ([[Corporate law|corporations law]]).\n\nJuridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (''universitas personarum'') to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its [[shareholder]]s). They may [[Lawsuit|sue and be sued]], enter contracts, incur [[debt]], and own [[property]]. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may [[Limited liability|shield its members]] from [[legal liability|personal liability]].\n\nIn some [[common law jurisdictions]] a distinction is drawn between ''corporation aggregate'' (such as a company, which is composed of a number of members) and a ''[[corporation sole]]'', which is a public office of '''legal personality''' separated from the individual holding the office; (both entities have separate legal personality).  Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the office of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is a corporation sole), but a [[Corporation sole#Examples of corporations sole in the United Kingdom|number of other public offices]] are now formed as corporations sole.\n\nThe concept of juridical personality is not absolute. \"[[Piercing the corporate veil]]\" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as [[Law of agency|agents]] involved in a [[corporate action|company action]] or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or [[public limited company]] are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or [[Board of directors#Directors|director]]s.\n\nThe concept of a juridical person is now central to [[Western law]] in both [[common law|common-law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3313312 The Juristic Person.

A [[corporation sole]] is a corporation constituted by a single member, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some [[legal benefit]] or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or [[The Crown]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by more than one member.\n**[[Municipality|Municipal corporations]] (municipalities) are \"creatures of [[statute]]\". Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons, including [[European economic interest grouping]]s (EEIGs).\n*[[Voluntary association|Unincorporated associations]], that is aggregates of two or more persons, are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions but not others.\n*[[Partnership]]s, an aggregate of two or more persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having an independent legal personality.\n*[[Company|Companies]], a form of [[Companies law|business association]] that carries on an industrial enterprise, are often corporations, although companies may take other forms, such as [[trade union]]s, [[Unlimited company|unlimited companies]], [[Investment trust|trusts]], and [[Mutual fund|funds]].

In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the doctrine of ''[[Person (canon law)#Juridic persons|persona ficta]]'' allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty.  Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of [[delict]] due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-[[contract (canon law)|contractual obligations]] to surrounding communities.  This effectively moved such liability to persons acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since persons were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of negligence and able to be [[excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]].<ref>John Dewey, \u201cThe Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality,\u201d Yale Law Journal, Vol. XXXV, April 1926, pages 655\u2013673</ref>\n\nIn the common law tradition, only a person could possess legal rights. To allow them to function, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights\u2014the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Textbook on legal methods, legal systems and research|last=Kanti.|first=Saha, Tushar|isbn=9788175348936|oclc=892043129|year = 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of [[personal jurisdiction]]). In ''Louisville, C. & C.R. Co. v. Letson'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is \"capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.\" Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that \"those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,\" should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.\n\n== Sample cases using the doctrine ==\n* In ''U.S. v. The Cooper Corp.'', (1941) the court held that the United States government, as a juristic person, could sue under the [[Sherman Act]]. Section 7 of the act granted the right to sue only to persons. The corporate defendant, which was accused of illegally conspiring and colluding to raise prices on [[tire]]s, argued that the U.S. government didn't have power to enforce the act because the government wasn't a person. The court held that the term \"person\" includes the U.S. Government, and allowed the action against the collusive corporations to continue.\n* In ''Cook County v. U.S. ex rel Chandler'', (2003) the County was accused of violating a law which forbids \"any person\" from falsely obtaining research funds from the government. The county received a $5 million grant, but used it to conduct inappropriate tests on human subjects. The county argued that it could not be held liable because it was not a person. The court held that the county could be sued under the law as a legal person.\n* In ''Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council'', (1993) the court declined to extend certain rights to legal persons. The association of prisoners sought to proceed ''[[in forma pauperis]].'' The court held that the right to sue ''in forma pauperis'' existed only for natural persons, not legal persons.\n\n== Extension of basic rights to legal persons ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe term juridical person (\"pessoa jur\u00eddica\" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is used in [[legal science]] for designating an entity with rights and liabilities which also has legal personality. Its regulations are largely based on Brazil's Civil Code, where it is distinctly recognized and defined, among other normative documents.\n\n[[Brazilian law]] recognizes any association or abstract entity as a juridical person, but a registry is required through a Constitutional Document, with specifications depending on the category of Juridical Person and local law of state and city.\n\n=== China ===\nFor a typical example of the concept of legal person in a civil law jurisdiction, under the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China|General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], Chapter III, Article 36., \"A legal person shall be an organization that has capacity for civil rights and capacity for civil conduct and independently enjoys civil rights and assumes civil obligations in accordance with the law.\"<ref>Gary J.

Art. 19 Abs. 3 GG|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{anchor| concept of \"Legal Person\" in Indian law | India }}\n\nIndian law defines two types of \"legal person\", the human beings as well as certain non-human entities which are given the same legal judicial personality as human beings. The non-human entities given the \"legal person\" status by the law ''\"have rights and co-relative duties; they can sue and be sued, can possess and transfer property\"''. Since these non-human entities are ''\"voiceless\"'' they are legally represented ''\"through guardians and representatives\"'' to claim their legal rights and to fulfill their legal duties and responsibilities. Specific non-human entities given the status of ''\"legal person\"'' include ''\"[[Corporate personhood|corporate personality]], [[body politic]], [[Charitable organization|charitable unions]] etc,\"'' as well as [[Trust_law#|trust estates]], [[deity]], temples, churches, mosques, hospitals, universities, colleges, banks, railways, municipalities, and gram panchayats (village councils), rivers, all animals and birds.<ref name=IndiaLaw>[https://qz.com/india/1636326/who-apart-from-human-beings-are-legal-persons-in-india/ Birds to holy rivers: A list of everything India considers \u201clegal persons\u201d], [[Quartz (publication)]], September 2019.</ref> \n\n====Corporates and trusts====\nIn court cases regarding corporate, the shareholders are not responsible for the company's debts but the company itself being a \"legal person\" is liable to repay those debts or be sued for the non-repayment of debts.<ref name=IndiaLaw/> \n\n====Animal kingdom====\nIn court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of ''\"legal person\"'' and humans have the [[Duty#Legal_duties|legal duty]] to act as \"[[In loco parentis|loco parentis]]\" towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children. A court while deciding the ''\"[[Animal Welfare Board of India]] vs Nagaraja\"'' case in 2014 mandated that anaimals are also entitled to the [[Fundamental_rights_in_India#Right_to_freedom|fundamental right to freedom]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Democratic Politics Class 9|publisher=NCERT}}</ref> enshrined in the Article 21 of [[Constitution of India]] i.e. right to life, personal liberty and the right to die with dignity ([[Euthanasia#Passive_and_active_euthanasia|passive euthanasia]]). In another case, a court in [[Uttarakhand]] state mandated that animals have the same rights as humans. In another case of [[Cattle_theft_in_India#Cattle_smuggling_in_India|cow-smuggling]], the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] mandated that ''\"entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic\"'' species has a ''\"distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person\"'' and humans are ''\"loco parentis\"'' while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and [[Working_animal|load carrying animals]] must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope.<ref name=IndiaLaw/> \n\n====Religious deities and concept of Shebait====\n{{ anchor | Shebait | Shebaitship }}\n{{ see also |Hindu law}}\n\nIn court cases regarding religious entities, the [[deity]] (deity or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred) is also a ''\"legal person\"'' who can engage in legal cases through ''\"[[trustee]]s\"'' or ''\"[[Board of directors|managing board]] in charge of the temple\"''. [[Supreme Court of India]] (SC), while deciding [[Ayodhya_dispute#Title_cases|Ayodhya case]] of [[Ram Janmabhoomi]], decided in 2010 that the deity [[Rama]] in the specific temple was a \"legal entity\" entitled to be represented by own lawyer appointed by the trustees acting on behalf of the deity. Similarly, in 2018 SC decided that the deity [[Ayyappan]] is a ''\"legal person\"'' with ''\"[[Fundamental_rights_in_India#Right_to_privacy|the right to privacy]]\"'' in the court case regarding the [[entry of women to Sabarimala]] shrine of Lord Ayyapan.<ref name=IndiaLaw/>\n\n=====Shebaitship=====\nUnder the Indian law, the ''\"shebaitship\"'' is the property owned by the deity or idol as a \"legal person\". Human appointed to act on behalf of deity are called the ''\"shebait\"''. A shebait acts as the guardian or custodian of deity to protect the right of deity and fulfill the legal duties of the deity. Shebait is similar to a trustee in case the deity or temple does have a legally registered trust or entity. Under the [[Hindu Law]] property gifted or offered as rituals or donations, etc absolutely belongs to the deity and not to the shebait. Case example are ''\"Profulla Chrone Requitte vs Satya Chorone Requitte, AIR 1979 SC 1682 (1686): (1979) 3 SCC 409: (1979) 3 SCR 431.

''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter's comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that \"the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the [[equal protection]] of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\"\n\nLater opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision.<ref>See, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=147&invol=165 Noble v. Union River Logging]</ref> As a result, because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], Congress may not make a law restricting the free speech of a corporation or a political action group or dictating the coverage of a local newspaper,<ref>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti</ref> and because of the [[Due Process Clause]], a state government may not take the property of a corporation without using due process of law and providing just compensation. These protections apply to all legal entities, not just corporations.\n\nA prominent component of relevant case law is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', which ruled unconstitutional certain restrictions on corporate campaign spending during elections.<ref>http://origin.www.supremecourt.gov/docket/08-205.htm {{Dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\n\nIn Act II, Scene 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1889 opera, ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', Giuseppe Palmieri (who serves, jointly with his brother Marco, as King of Barataria) requests that he and his brother be also recognized individually so that they might each receive individual portions of food as they have \"two independent appetites\".

It was built from 1877 to 1950. It is also known as '''Orange Railway Station and yard group'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1218>{{cite NSW SHR|5012127|Orange Railway Station and yard group|hr=01218|fn=10/05593|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe station serves the city of [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and opened on 19 April 1877 when the line was extended from [[Blayney railway station|Blayney]]. It served as the terminus of the line until it was extended to [[Wellington railway station, New South Wales|Wellington]] on 1 June 1880.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Orange Orange Station] NSWrail.net</ref><ref>{{cite NSW SHR|4806345|Orange Railway Precinct|hr=|accessdate=}}</ref> A disused bay platform is located at the southern end.\n\n== History ==\nOrange is located on the Main Western line. The single line railway from [[Blayney, New South Wales|Blayney]] to Orange was opened on 19 April 1877. The line was duplicated from Spring Hill to Orange on 5 November 1916.<ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nIn 1874 a contract was awarded for construction of the line from [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] to Orange and in 1876 a contract let for construction of a combined station/ residence building, goods shed and station verandah at Orange. The design for the new station building/residence was finalised in 1876 and the building completed the following year, being officially opened on 19 April 1877. A Guards' rest house was also provided in 1877, and in 1885 a branch line was opened from Orange East Fork to [[Molong]].<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1610>Cottee, 2004; SRA, 1993.</ref>\n\nIn the year of the railways' arrival to Orange, {{convert|20170|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land was under cultivation, wheat being the primary crop. It was the wheat farmer, therefore, that stood to benefit most from the opening of the line. Accordingly, the initial planning of the precinct included a goods shed, which still stands today, for the loading of Orange grown grains onto rail trucks destined for [[Sydney]] markets. The original goods shed was much longer than it is today, extending northward almost to the end of the railway station platform, where the carpark is now, and utilizing the jib crane.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745>B Cubed Sustainability, 2007</ref><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nThe original 1875 plans for the station arrangement for Orange show that the Orange precinct was intended to service more than just passenger trains. The precinct included a depot and carriage shed with a turntable opposite the railway station and goods shed. The depot was subsequently moved in 1937 to East Fork and the area was converted for use as a marshalling yard.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nThe 1930s saw significant developments to the rail infrastructure at Orange. With the Railway Institute already established, it was announced in 1936 that the new headquarters for the District Superintendent of Railways was to be constructed next to the station on the north-western side. As the town of Orange grew, the rail activities at Orange were being divided between the station in town and the depot at East Fork and accordingly the coal shed (perhaps only a coal dump or an elevated loading facility) and engine shed were relocated from an area opposite the station to East Fork in 1937.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nIn 1938, a signal box was added to the precinct, south of the goods shed and in-between the bifurcated main line and the lines of the marshalling area. The construction of the signal box represented the modernization of the 19th century railway station and yard and a new mechanized system of signalling to better cope with the increased number of trains travelling through Orange.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nOver time, the arrangement of the rail precinct at Orange has changed as a result of the development of Orange as a major regional centre, and due to changes in railway technology and practices. Once the rail head moved on from Orange in 1880 and the railways continued into far western NSW, Orange turned to the production of fruit, finding it increasingly difficult to compete with the wheat production in the drier climate wheat districts. The production of grain in the Orange district in the 19th century was replaced to a large extent with fruit by the 1950s. A reflection of this change was the construction of the Orange Producers Rural Association (OPR) transhipment shed ({{circa|1959}}) within the Orange railway precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nOther additions and alterations within the Orange railway station and yard included the installation of a gantry crane (1896), erection of a carriage shed (1897), extension of the awning over the station platform (1898), alterations to station buildings (1918), provision of a wheat stacking site in the triangle (1918), construction of institute building (1921), new stockyards (1935), and at least one new rest house for Loco staff (1939).<ref name=nswshr-1218-1610/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\n==Services==\nOrange is served by [[NSW TrainLink]]'s daily ''[[Central West Express|Central West]] [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]]'' service operating between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]] and the weekly ''[[Outback Xplorer]]'' between Sydney and [[Broken Hill railway station|Broken Hill]].<ref name=Timetable>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|Western Region}}</ref>\n\nNSW TrainLink road coach services operating between [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow]], [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]] and [[Nyngan]] also serve the station.<ref name=Timetable/>\n\nAbout {{convert|2|km|spell=on}} south of the station, the [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill line]] branches off.

The building has since undergone a series of modifications but retains its Victorian form and character.<ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nThe building houses the central booking office, with extended wings along the platform for parcels, refreshments, waiting rooms and toilets. The building is constructed of brick in [[Brickwork|Flemish bond]] with label moulded rendered heads for openings, and corbelled and moulded render sills to double hung [[Sash window|sash]] arched windows. The [[veranda]]h is long and low to the platform and is supported on cast iron composite Corinthian style [[columns]] with cast iron angle [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] supporting roof in four directions.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\n;Station Master's Residence, 1885\nThe former Station Master's residence is located at 158 Peisley St. It was built c.1885, is late Victorian and includes the following features: gabled front end and octagonal [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] with pitched slate roof; main roof of [[Hipped roof|hipped]] and [[gable]] form; four panel glazed entrance door; glazed French verandah doors; sloping iron verandah roof supported on square stop chamfered timber posts, and fine moulded rendered [[chimneys]].<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nRailway institute building, {{circa|1921}}\nFederation style [[weatherboard]] house with pitched [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof and brick [[chimney]]. The verandah extends over the front [[porch]] only supported by timber posts and brick columns.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\n;Administration building, {{circa|1950}}\nThe Administration Building is a symmetrical three storey polychromatic, brick building with a pitched tiled roof. It has evenly spaced windows around all sides of both levels, and the entrance way is marked with a neo-classical [[portico]]. Internally there have been some modifications, particularly to the first floor where offices and equipment relating to train controls have been installed. Security grates have been fitted to some windows and air-conditioning installed, unsympathetically in some instances. Window frames have been replaced with aluminium frames. The building has all new floor coverings and toilets have been installed. A glass panel and door has been added inside the entrance arch. The general internal layout is likely to be similar to as built, as are ceilings, some [[Baseboard|skirting]], doors and stair banisters.<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/>\n\n;Goods shed, 1877\nThe goods shed consists of an internal frame of long Oregon hardwood timber beams clad in corrugated iron with a pitched roof. The roof has skylights along the enclosed section. The original shed was almost twice as long as it is today having extended northward to the end of the Orange railway station platform to where the jib crane still stands. The current dimensions are approximately 42m x 11.4m. The building has also been modified through the introduction of aluminium windows, roller doors and an [[awning]] extending from the northern end of the western side of the structure, along with landscaping. During its time of operation, a rail line passed through the eastern side of the building. The line is now covered over, and has possibly been removed. A wooden platform remains through the centre of the shed. The goods shed is being leased to Australian Native Landscapes as a storage and display centre for the retail of landscaping supplies. The tenants have constructed an office at the northern end of the building and a sales point in the centre.<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/>\n\n;Rail motor shed, {{circa|1950}}\nLocated in the goods yard adjacent to the goods shed. The shed is constructed using iron beams and [[trusses]] and corrugated iron cladding. Disused railway tracks run into the shed and there is a diesel tank sitting aloft iron [[Stilts (architecture)|stilts]] to the southern end of the eastern side of the structure. The type and condition of the materials used in the rail motor shed would suggest the provenance of the rail motor shed to be mid 20th century. Currently, the shed is part of the Australian Native Landscapes lease but is not being used for any function.<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/>\n\n;Signal box, 1938\nThe signal box is a two-storey timber board building located between the crossing loop track and the Main line south of the Orange railway station. The majority of the signals have been disconnected and decommissioned. Some levers have been removed. Air-conditioning has been installed.<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/>\n\n;Transhipment shed\nThe transhipment (OPR) shed was constructed {{circa|1959}} by the Orange Producers Rural Association and is located on the eastern side of the rail precinct opposite the Orange railway station and goods shed. The building is an open style shed consisting of an iron support structure covered over with corrugated iron. The OPR shed [[Span (architecture)|spans]] over track that was previously the eighth line of 8 marshalling sidings at Orange. The shed is in a good condition though its integrity is diminished.<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/>\n\n;Perway office and depot\nThe Permanent Way Depot is located opposite the Administration Building on the eastern side of the Orange rail precinct to the north of the station. The buildings include an office and various [[sheds]].

It was built from 1877 to 1950. It is also known as '''Orange Railway Station and yard group'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1218>{{cite NSW SHR|5012127|Orange Railway Station and yard group|hr=01218|fn=10/05593|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe station serves the city of [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and opened on 19 April 1877 when the line was extended from [[Blayney railway station|Blayney]]. It served as the terminus of the line until it was extended to [[Wellington railway station, New South Wales|Wellington]] on 1 June 1880.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Orange Orange Station] NSWrail.net</ref><ref>{{cite NSW SHR|4806345|Orange Railway Precinct|hr=|accessdate=}}</ref> A disused bay platform is located at the southern end.\n\n== History ==\nOrange is located on the Main Western line. The single line railway from [[Blayney, New South Wales|Blayney]] to Orange was opened on 19 April 1877. The line was duplicated from Spring Hill to Orange on 5 November 1916.<ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nIn 1874 a contract was awarded for construction of the line from [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] to Orange and in 1876 a contract let for construction of a combined station/ residence building, goods shed and station verandah at Orange. The design for the new station building/residence was finalised in 1876 and the building completed the following year, being officially opened on 19 April 1877. A Guards' rest house was also provided in 1877, and in 1885 a branch line was opened from Orange East Fork to [[Molong]].<ref name=nswshr-1218/><ref name=nswshr-1218-1610>Cottee, 2004; SRA, 1993.</ref>\n\nIn the year of the railways' arrival to Orange, {{convert|20170|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land was under cultivation, wheat being the primary crop. It was the wheat farmer, therefore, that stood to benefit most from the opening of the line. Accordingly, the initial planning of the precinct included a goods shed, which still stands today, for the loading of Orange grown grains onto rail trucks destined for [[Sydney]] markets. The original goods shed was much longer than it is today, extending northward almost to the end of the railway station platform, where the carpark is now, and utilizing the jib crane.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745>B Cubed Sustainability, 2007</ref><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nThe original 1875 plans for the station arrangement for Orange show that the Orange precinct was intended to service more than just passenger trains. The precinct included a depot and carriage shed with a turntable opposite the railway station and goods shed. The depot was subsequently moved in 1937 to East Fork and the area was converted for use as a marshalling yard.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nThe 1930s saw significant developments to the rail infrastructure at Orange. With the Railway Institute already established, it was announced in 1936 that the new headquarters for the District Superintendent of Railways was to be constructed next to the station on the north-western side. As the town of Orange grew, the rail activities at Orange were being divided between the station in town and the depot at East Fork and accordingly the coal shed (perhaps only a coal dump or an elevated loading facility) and engine shed were relocated from an area opposite the station to East Fork in 1937.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nIn 1938, a signal box was added to the precinct, south of the goods shed and in-between the bifurcated main line and the lines of the marshalling area. The construction of the signal box represented the modernization of the 19th century railway station and yard and a new mechanized system of signalling to better cope with the increased number of trains travelling through Orange.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nOver time, the arrangement of the rail precinct at Orange has changed as a result of the development of Orange as a major regional centre, and due to changes in railway technology and practices. Once the rail head moved on from Orange in 1880 and the railways continued into far western NSW, Orange turned to the production of fruit, finding it increasingly difficult to compete with the wheat production in the drier climate wheat districts. The production of grain in the Orange district in the 19th century was replaced to a large extent with fruit by the 1950s. A reflection of this change was the construction of the Orange Producers Rural Association (OPR) transhipment shed ({{circa|1959}}) within the Orange railway precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1218-1745/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\nOther additions and alterations within the Orange railway station and yard included the installation of a gantry crane (1896), erection of a carriage shed (1897), extension of the awning over the station platform (1898), alterations to station buildings (1918), provision of a wheat stacking site in the triangle (1918), construction of institute building (1921), new stockyards (1935), and at least one new rest house for Loco staff (1939).<ref name=nswshr-1218-1610/><ref name=nswshr-1218/>\n\n==Services==\nOrange is served by [[NSW TrainLink]]'s daily ''[[Central West Express|Central West]] [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]]'' service operating between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]] and the weekly ''[[Outback Xplorer]]'' between Sydney and [[Broken Hill railway station|Broken Hill]].<ref name=Timetable>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|Western Region}}</ref>\n\nNSW TrainLink road coach services operating between [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow]], [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]] and [[Nyngan]] also serve the station.<ref name=Timetable/>\n\nAbout {{convert|2|km|spell=on}} south of the station, the [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill line]] branches off.

The original shed was almost twice as long as it is today having extended northward to the end of the Orange railway station platform to where the jib crane still stands. The current dimensions are approximately 42m x 11.4m. The building has also been modified through the introduction of aluminium windows, roller doors and an [[awning]] extending from the northern end of the western side of the structure, along with landscaping. During its time of operation, a rail line passed through the eastern side of the building. The line is now covered over, and has possibly been removed. A wooden platform remains through the centre of the shed. The goods shed is being leased to Australian Native Landscapes as a storage and display centre for the retail of landscaping supplies.
