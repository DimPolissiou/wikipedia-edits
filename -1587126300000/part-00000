There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]]. The camp was completely cleared and demolished in October 2016. According to Government plans, 6,400 migrants would be moved to 280 temporary reception centres around France. There were concerns over the fate of 200 [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] published a report in 2017 stating that up to 1,000 migrants were still living in the Calais region.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Calais2015g.jpg|thumb|Badeldin Shogar, a Sudanese migrant, at the Jungle in October 2015]]\n{{see also|Migrants around Calais}}\n{{see also|Timeline of the European migrant crisis}}\n\nMigrants [[migrants around Calais|based in Calais]] were attempting to enter the United Kingdom via the [[Port of Calais]] or the [[Channel Tunnel]] by [[stowing away]] on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21660581-camp-channels-edge-sideshow-europes-migrant-crisis-it-offers-important|title=Learning from the Jungle|work=The Economist|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=28 December 2015|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714000401/https://www.economist.com/europe/2015/08/06/learning-from-the-jungle |archive-date=6 August 2015}}</ref> Some migrants were attempting to return to the United Kingdom having once lived there,<ref name=\"Avoid\" /> whilst others were attempting to enter the British labour market to [[Unreported employment|work illegally]] rather than claim asylum in France.<ref name=\"bbc2\" /><ref name=\"guard3Sept\" /> Some migrants lived in the camp while seeking asylum in France, a choice they made because the French system did not provide for them while their claim was being processed, leaving them [[Homelessness in France|homeless]] for the duration.<ref>Francesca Ansaloni, 'Deterritorialising the Jungle: Understanding the Calais camp through its orderings' in ''Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space'' (25/02/20) doi.org/10.1177/2399654420908597</ref> One migrant from [[Egypt]], a politics graduate, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he had \"paid $3,000 (\u00a32,000) to leave Egypt, risked my life on a boat to Italy spending days at sea\" and that in one month he had tried 20 times to reach England; another, an [[Eritrea]]n woman with a one-year-old child, had paid \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,825) \u2013 and her husband the same \u2013 to sail to [[Italy]], but her husband had [[European migrant crisis#Deaths and incidents|drowned during the journey]].<ref name=\"horror\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town 'At night it's like a horror movie'&nbsp;\u2013 inside Calais's official shantytown.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629210030/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town |date=29 June 2016 }} Angelique Chrisafis, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 April 2015.

[[France]] that existed from January 2015 to October 2016. There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]]. The camp was completely cleared and demolished in October 2016. According to Government plans, 6,400 migrants would be moved to 280 temporary reception centres around France. There were concerns over the fate of 200 [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] published a report in 2017 stating that up to 1,000 migrants were still living in the Calais region.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Calais2015g.jpg|thumb|Badeldin Shogar, a Sudanese migrant, at the Jungle in October 2015]]\n{{see also|Migrants around Calais}}\n{{see also|Timeline of the European migrant crisis}}\n\nMigrants [[migrants around Calais|based in Calais]] were attempting to enter the United Kingdom via the [[Port of Calais]] or the [[Channel Tunnel]] by [[stowing away]] on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21660581-camp-channels-edge-sideshow-europes-migrant-crisis-it-offers-important|title=Learning from the Jungle|work=The Economist|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=28 December 2015|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714000401/https://www.economist.com/europe/2015/08/06/learning-from-the-jungle |archive-date=6 August 2015}}</ref> Some migrants were attempting to return to the United Kingdom having once lived there,<ref name=\"Avoid\" /> whilst others were attempting to enter the British labour market to [[Unreported employment|work illegally]] rather than claim asylum in France.<ref name=\"bbc2\" /><ref name=\"guard3Sept\" /> Some migrants lived in the camp while seeking asylum in France, a choice they made because the French system did not provide for them while their claim was being processed, leaving them [[Homelessness in France|homeless]] for the duration.<ref>Francesca Ansaloni, 'Deterritorialising the Jungle: Understanding the Calais camp through its orderings' in ''Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space'' (25/02/20) doi.org/10.1177/2399654420908597</ref> One migrant from [[Egypt]], a politics graduate, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he had \"paid $3,000 (\u00a32,000) to leave Egypt, risked my life on a boat to Italy spending days at sea\" and that in one month he had tried 20 times to reach England; another, an [[Eritrea]]n woman with a one-year-old child, had paid \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,825) \u2013 and her husband the same \u2013 to sail to [[Italy]], but her husband had [[European migrant crisis#Deaths and incidents|drowned during the journey]].<ref name=\"horror\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town 'At night it's like a horror movie'&nbsp;\u2013 inside Calais's official shantytown.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629210030/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town |date=29 June 2016 }} Angelique Chrisafis, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 April 2015.
