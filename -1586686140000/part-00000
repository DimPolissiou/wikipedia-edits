The 504th Bomb Group's aircraft engaged in [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombardment operations against Japan. Its aircraft were identified by a \"E\" inside a Circle painted on the tail.\n\nThe 504th Bombardment Group flew the last combat mission by the United States Army Air Forces of World War II, its last combat mission being on 15 August 1945. It was inactivated on 15 June 1946.\n\n==History==\nThe unit was established in early 1944 at [[Dalhart Army Air Field]], Texas, being formed as a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombardment group. The unit was initially formed with four bomb squadrons ([[393d Bomb Squadron|393d]], [[98th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron|398th]], [[421st Air Refueling Squadron|421st]], and [[507th Bombardment Squadron]]s), being a mixture of both newly constituted and reassigned units. The 398th was formerly a [[III Bomber Command]] [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] medium bomber [[Operational - Replacement Training Units#Operational Training Units|Operational Training Unit]] in the southeastern United States, being formed in 1942. It later became a [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] [[Operational - Replacement Training Units#Replacement Training Units|Replacement Training Unit]] until being inactivated in October 1943.\n\nDue to a shortage of B-29s, the group was initially equipped with [[II Bomber Command]] [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]es previously used for training heavy bomber replacement personnel. The unit was then reassigned for advanced training and received B-29s at [[Fairmont Army Air Field]], Nebraska during the late spring and summer of 1944.\n\nIn May, B-29 groups were reorganized to have three, rather than four squadrons, and the 507th Squadron was inactivated, with its personnel being consolidated into other group squadrons (the 507th would be reactivated a month later as part of the [[333d Bombardment Group]]). In November, the 393d Bombardment Squadron was reassigned to the [[509th Composite Group]] at [[Wendover Field]], Utah, leaving the 504th to be a two squadron group. The 393d became the 509th's only operational B-29 squadron. The 393d would eventually become the only military unit in history to engage in [[nuclear warfare]], dropping [[Atomic Bomb]]s on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Japan, in August 1945.\n\nAs a two squadron group, the 504th was deployed to [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] in late 1944, being assigned to the [[XXI Bomber Command]] [[313th Bombardment Wing]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]; being stationed at [[North Field, Tinian]]. The group began combat operations from Tinian in January 1945 with attacks on Japanese airfields and other installations on [[Maug]] and [[Iwo Jima]] and in the [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] Islands. Flew its first mission against the Japanese home islands early in February 1945 when the group bombed the industrial area of [[Kobe]]. Continued to attack strategic targets in Japan, operating in daylight and at high altitude to bomb such objectives as aircraft factories, chemical plants, harbors, and arsenals. Switched to night incendiary raids attacking major Japanese cities in the spring of 1945, causing massive destruction of urbanized areas.\n\nReceived a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC) for striking the industrial center at [[Yokohama]] late in May 1945. Began [[incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] raids in March 1945, flying at night and at low altitude to strike area targets in Japan. Started mining operations against enemy shipping late in Mar, receiving a second DUC for mining [[Korea]]n shipping lanes, the [[Shimonoseki Strait]], and harbors of the Inland Sea, July\u2013August 1945. In April and May 1945 the group hit airfields from which the Japanese launched [[kamikaze]] planes against the invasion force during the assault on [[Okinawa]]. During mid June 1945 the 680th Bomb Squadron was attached to the 504th bomb group to bring the group up to full strength with 3 squadrons. The group continued strategic bombing raids and incendiary attacks until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945.\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the 504th dropped supplies to Allied prisoners, participated in show-of-force missions, and flew over Japan to evaluate bombardment damage. In the fall of 1945, the group largely demobilized as part of the \"Sunset Project\", with some aircraft being sent reclamation on Tinian; others being returned to the United States for storage at aircraft depots in the southwest. By Christmas, the group fleet was reduced to 30 or less planes Many of the remaining veterans signed for \"any conditions of travel\" to get home, arriving three weeks later in [[Oakland]], California, where troop trains scattered them for points of discharge close to their homes.\n\nThe unit was largely a paper organization when it was reassigned to [[Clark Field]] in the Philippines in March 1946, and assigned to [[Thirteenth Air Force]]. At Clark its remaining aircraft and personnel were consolidated into other units, and it was inactivated in June.\n\n===Lineage===\n* Constituted as the '''504th Bombardment Group''', Very Heavy on 18 February 1944\n: Activated on 11 March 1944\n: Inactivated on 15 June 1946<ref name=Maurer504BG>Maurer, pp. 276-277</ref>\n\n===Assignments===\n* [[Second Air Force]], 11 March-5 November 1944\n: Attached to [[17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)]], 12 March-5 November 1944\n* [[313th Bombardment Wing]], 23 December 1944\n* [[Thirteenth Air Force]], 6 March \u2013 15 June 1946\n\n===Components===\n* 393d Bombardment Squadron:  11 March-25 November 1944\n* 398th Bombardment Squadron: 11 March 1944 \u2013 15 June 1946\n* 421st Bombardment Squadron: 11 March 1944 \u2013 15 June 1946\n* 507th Bombardment Squadron: 11 March-10 May 1944\n* [[680th Bombardment Squadron]]: Attached, 15 June 1945; assigned 14 November 1945 \u2013 15 June 1946\n* 20th Photographic Laboratory Squadron\n\n===Stations===\n* Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas, 11 March 1944\n* Fairmont Army Air Field, Nebraska, 12 March-5 November 1944\n* North Field, Tinian, Mariana Islands, 23 December 1944\n* Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, 13 March \u2013 15 June 1946<ref name=Maurer504BG/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n* Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 1944 (Training only)\n* Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1944\u20131946<ref name=Maurer504BG/>\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/21/2001330256/-1/-1/0/AFD-100921-044.pdf|accessdate= December 17, 2016|edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher= Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Dec/02/2001329899/-1/-1/0/AFD-101202-002.pdf |edition= reprint|accessdate= December 17, 2016|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402| pages= }}\n* {{cite book|last=Watkins|first=Robert A.|title=Insignia and Aircraft Markings of the U.S. Army Air Force In World War II|volume=Volume VI, China-Burma-India & The Western Pacific|year=2017|publisher=Shiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen,PA|isbn=978-0-7643-5273-7|pages=}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://rjs.org/ww2/ 504th Bomb Group Website]\n\n{{USAAF 20th Air Force World War II}}\n{{USAAF 2d Air Force World War II}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1944]]\n[[Category:Japanese home islands campaign]]\n[[Category:World War II strategic bombing units]]\n[[Category:World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre]]\n[[Category:Bombardment groups of the United States Army Air Forces]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=January 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use American English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name= 504th Bombardment Group\n|image=504th Bombardment Group over Mount Fuji 1945.jpg\n|image_size=300\n|caption=504th Bombardment Group [[B-29 Superfortress]] formation over Mount Fuji in 1945\n|dates=1944\u20131946\n|country={{USA}}\n|branch={{air force|USA}}\n|type=\n|role=Bombardment\n|size=\n|command_structure=\n|current_commander=\n|garrison=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=Quem Virtutem Imperant [[Latin]] Those Who Are Virtuous Command\n|colors=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|battles=[[Pacific Theater of Operations]]\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=[[Distinguished Unit Citation]]\n <!-- Insignia -->\n|identification_symbol=[[File:504bg.JPG|125px]]\n|identification_symbol_label=504th Bombardment Group emblem<ref>Watkins, pp.110-111</ref>\n|identification_symbol_2=\n|identification_symbol_2_label=\n}}\n[[File:504th Bombardment Group bomb loaders 1945.jpg|thumb|504th Bombardment Group bomb loaders 1945]]\nThe '''504th Bombardment Group''' (504th BG) was a [[World War II]] [[United States Army Air Forces]] combat organization. \n\nThe unit served primarily in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]] as part of [[Twentieth Air Force]].

The group continued strategic bombing raids and incendiary attacks until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945.\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the 504th dropped supplies to Allied prisoners, participated in show-of-force missions, and flew over Japan to evaluate bombardment damage. In the fall of 1945, the group largely demobilized as part of the \"Sunset Project\", with some aircraft being sent reclamation on Tinian; others being returned to the United States for storage at aircraft depots in the southwest. By Christmas, the group fleet was reduced to 30 or less planes Many of the remaining veterans signed for \"any conditions of travel\" to get home, arriving three weeks later in [[Oakland]], California, where troop trains scattered them for points of discharge close to their homes.\n\nThe unit was largely a paper organization when it was reassigned to [[Clark Field]] in the Philippines in March 1946, and assigned to [[Thirteenth Air Force]]. At Clark its remaining aircraft and personnel were consolidated into other units, and it was inactivated in June.\n\n===Lineage===\n* Constituted as the '''504th Bombardment Group''', Very Heavy on 18 February 1944\n: Activated on 11 March 1944\n: Inactivated on 15 June 1946<ref name=Maurer504BG>Maurer, pp. 276-277</ref>\n\n===Assignments===\n* [[Second Air Force]], 11 March-5 November 1944\n: Attached to [[17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)]], 12 March-5 November 1944\n* [[313th Bombardment Wing]], 23 December 1944\n* [[Thirteenth Air Force]], 6 March \u2013 15 June 1946\n\n===Components===\n* 393d Bombardment Squadron:  11 March-25 November 1944\n* 398th Bombardment Squadron: 11 March 1944 \u2013 15 June 1946\n* 421st Bombardment Squadron: 11 March 1944 \u2013 15 June 1946\n* 507th Bombardment Squadron: 11 March-10 May 1944\n* [[680th Bombardment Squadron]]: Attached, 15 June 1945; assigned 14 November 1945 \u2013 15 June 1946\n* 20th Photographic Laboratory Squadron\n\n===Stations===\n* Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas, 11 March 1944\n* Fairmont Army Air Field, Nebraska, 12 March-5 November 1944\n* North Field, Tinian, Mariana Islands, 23 December 1944\n* Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, 13 March \u2013 15 June 1946<ref name=Maurer504BG/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n* Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 1944 (Training only)\n* Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1944\u20131946<ref name=Maurer504BG/>\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/21/2001330256/-1/-1/0/AFD-100921-044.pdf|accessdate= December 17, 2016|edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher= Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Dec/02/2001329899/-1/-1/0/AFD-101202-002.pdf |edition= reprint|accessdate= December 17, 2016|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402| pages= }}\n* {{cite book|last=Watkins|first=Robert A.|title=Insignia and Aircraft Markings of the U.S. Army Air Force In World War II|volume=Volume VI, China-Burma-India & The Western Pacific|year=2017|publisher=Shiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen,PA|isbn=978-0-7643-5273-7|pages=}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://rjs.org/ww2/ 504th Bomb Group Website]\n\n{{USAAF 20th Air Force World War II}}\n{{USAAF 2d Air Force World War II}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1944]]\n[[Category:Japanese home islands campaign]]\n[[Category:World War II strategic bombing units]]\n[[Category:World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre]]\n[[Category:Bombardment groups of the United States Army Air Forces]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Pacific Theater of Operations\u2192Pacific Ocean theater of World War II,incendiary\u2192incendiary ammunition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/504th_Bombardment_Group"}

K., Saijo, K., Winner, B., Marchetto, M. C., & Gage, F. H. (2010). Mechanisms Underlying Inflammation in Neurodegeneration. Cell, 140(6), 918-934. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.016</ref> One major cell type involved in neuroinflammation is the [[microglia]]. Microglia are recognized as the [[innate immune system|innate immune cells]] of the [[central nervous system]]. Microglia actively survey their environment and change their cell morphology significantly in response to neural injury. Acute inflammation in the brain is typically characterized by rapid activation of microglia. During this period, there is no peripheral immune response. Over time, however, chronic inflammation causes the degradation of tissue and of the blood\u2013brain barrier. During this time, microglia generate [[reactive oxygen species]] and release signals to recruit peripheral immune cells for an inflammatory response.\n\nIn addition, [[microglia]] are known to have two major states: M1, a state in which cells are activated and secrete [[inflammation|pro-inflammatory]] factors; and M2, a state in which cells are deactivated and secrete [[anti-inflammatory]] factors.<ref>Zlokovic, B. V. (2008). The Blood-Brain Barrier in Health and Chronic Neurodegenerative Disorders. Neuron, 57(2), 178-201. doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.003</ref> Microglia are usually in a resting state (M2), but in Parkinson's disease can enter M1 due to the presence of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. The M1 microglia release pro-inflammatory factors which can cause motor neurons to die. In this case, dying cells can release factors to increase the activation of M1 microglia, leading to a [[positive feedback|positive feedback loop]] which causes continually increasing cell death.<ref name=\"Glass(2010)\" />\n\n==BBB breakdown==\n[[File:Blood-brain barrier transport en.png|thumb|left|alt=An image depicting blood-brain barrier shape and function.|An image depicting blood-brain barrier shape and function.]]\nThe fifth proposed major mechanism for cell death is the breakdown of the [[Blood-Brain Barrier|blood-brain barrier]] (BBB). The BBB has three cell types which tightly regulate the flow of molecules in and out of the brain: [[Endothelium|endothelial cells]], [[pericyte|pericytes,]] and [[astrocyte]]s. In neurodegenerative diseases, BBB breakdown has been measured and identified in specific regions of the brain, including the [[substantia nigra]] in Parkinson's disease and [[hippocampus]] in Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=Zlokovic(2011)>Zlokovic, B.

Cell receptor disruption can also affect the ability for cells to adhere to one another with [[adherens junction]]s.<ref>F\u00f6rster, C., Burek, M., Romero, I.

This in turn leads to the breakdown of gap junctions.<ref name=Nagasawa(2006)>Nagasawa, K., Chiba, H., Fujita, H., Kojima, T., Saito, T., Endo, T., & Sawada, N. (2006).

However, as gap junctions break down, plasma proteins are able to enter in [[extracellular matrix]] the brain.<ref name=Nagasawa(2006)/> This mechanism is also known as vascular leakiness, where capillary degeneration leads to blood and blood proteins \"leaking\" into the brain. Vascular leakiness can eventually cause neurons to alter their function and shift towards [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] behavior or cell death.\n\n==Impact on locomotion==\n[[File:Paralysis agitans-Male Parkinson's victim-1892.jpg|thumb|alt=An image depicting Parkinsonian gait.|An image depicting Parkinsonian gait.]]\nDopaminergic neurons are the most abundant type of neuron in the [[Substantia Nigra|substantia nigra]], a part of the brain regulating motor control and learning. [[Dopamine]] is a [[neurotransmitter]] which activates [[motor neuron]]s in the [[central nervous system]]. The activated motor neurons then transmit their signals, via [[action potential]], to motor neurons in the legs.<ref>Barnett MW, Larkman PM; Larkman (June 2007). \"The action potential\". Pract Neurol 7 (3): 192\u20137. {{PMID|17515599}}</ref> However, when a significant percentage of the motor neurons die (about 50-60%), this decreases dopamine levels by up to 80%.<ref name=Pickrell(2015)/> This inhibits the ability for neurons to generate and transmit a signal.

There were various police bands in the RCMP that flourished during the 1950s, leading the [[Canadian government]] granting approval for a full-time central band to be created in December 1958, with headquarters in the capital of [[Ottawa]]. It was listed repeatedly as one of Canada's finest bands, which earned it the privilege of being able to play for dignitaries such as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job apart from their actual jobs in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP's notable [[Red Serge]] and adopted in the band Canadian military discipline which was in part inspired by the [[British Army]]'s experience with military and police bands. Appearances made by the band also included the [[Expo 86]] and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings|Commonwealth Conference]] in [[Vancouver]], as well as the [[Calgary Winter Olympics]] in 1988. To this day, many RCMP officers continue the original band's tradition by serving in smaller police bands in areas of RCMP operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://militarymusic.com/blogs/military-music/13516489-the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-band|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band|website=Altissimo!}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/canadiancavalry/rcmpbands.htm|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|first=Stephen|last=Luscombe|website=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rcmpband.ca/history/|title=History|date=April 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nInstead of brass and reed bands, the RCMP now sponsors eight regional pipe bands across the major cities of the 10 provinces.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|100px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the university after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]].

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|100px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.
