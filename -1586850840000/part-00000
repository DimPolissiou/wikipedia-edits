The two nations had signed a border treaty following the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]] of 1941, but Ecuador later disagreed with the treaty as it applied to the Cenepa and Paquisha areas, and in 1960 Ecuador declared the treaty null and void.\n\nMediation efforts of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and the [[United States]] paved the way for the opening of diplomatic conversations that ultimately led to the signing of a definitive peace agreement (the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]) on 26 October 1998.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas# |title=Database - Uppsala Conflict Data Program |publisher=UCDP.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas |archive-date=2013-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999 which effectively put an end to one of the longest territorial disputes in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/>\n\nIt is, as of 2020, the most recent military conflict in the Americas between countries contesting sovereignty over territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\nThe Cenepa War was the most recent military clash between Ecuador and Peru over a long-standing territorial dispute that dated back to the first decades of the 19th century, when both countries came into being after the Wars of Independence of the Spanish colonies in South America.\n\nIn modern times there were three previous military confrontations: [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857\u201360|War Ecuadorian-Peruvian 1858]], a [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|full-scale war in 1941]], the [[Paquisha War]] in 1981, both of which had seen the [[Peruvian military]] forces prevailing over the [[Ecuadorian military]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Image:Ecuador-Peru-Frontera.svg|thumb|left|350px|Ecuador-Per\u00fa border]]\nMost of the fighting of the Cenepa war was centered around the control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the [[Cenepa River]] (see map), a highland area covered with dense Amazonian jungle, inside a 78&nbsp;km-long strip of territory where the process of demarcation between Ecuador and Peru remained stalled since 1951.\n\nOne of the outposts causing the dispute, called '''Tiwintza''' by the Ecuadorians, and Tiwinza by the Peruvians, came to symbolize the war because of the bitter clashes that took place around it, and the emotional importance that both sides attached to its possession. The conflict continued until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces, supervised by the MOMEP, a multinational mission of military observers from the \"guarantor\" countries of the 1942 [[Rio Protocol]]: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the USA.\n\nThe Cenepa war ended up producing far-reaching consequences for relations between Ecuador and Peru. The military outcome of the brief conflict, no vindicating the Ecuadorian armed forces after the disappointing results of the war of 1858, 1941, 1981, and by calling to the attention of the Peruvians the need for a resolution of a problem, paved the way for a definitive settlement of the border issues.\n\nThus, in the aftermath of the war, both nations, brokered by the \"guarantors\" of the Rio Protocol, entered into a long and difficult negotiation process that concluded with the signing of a [[Peace Treaty]] in 1998, and the closing of the hitherto un-demarcated stretch of common border, deep in the Amazonian rainforest.\n\n===Disputed border===\nFollowing the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]] of 1941, both countries had signed in 1942 a Peace Treaty known as the [[Rio Protocol]]. This treaty \u2014 brokered by the US, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, which became known as the \"guarantors\" of the peace settlement \u2014 had the main purpose of defining the hitherto badly defined borders between Ecuador and Peru. The process of demarcation, begun in mid-1942, came to a halt in 1948, when populist Ecuadorian President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] declared the Protocol impossible to implement in the area of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'', claiming inconsistencies between the instructions of the Protocol and the geographical realities on the ground.\n\nPeru contested this view, stating that such discrepancies had already been solved in an arbitration that had taken place in 1945, and that all that had to be done was to close the border following the guidelines of the Protocol and the ruling of the 1945 arbitration\n\nBy the beginning of the 1950s, the situation had come to a deadlock. For the next 46 years, a 78&nbsp;km-long strip of mostly unpopulated, and little explored territory, deep in the Amazonian rainforest and almost inaccessible by land, was left undemarcated, serving as a flashpoint for recurrent diplomatic and military crisis between Ecuador and Peru.\nWhile Peru held to the view that the border in the undermarcated area ran along the heights of the Condor range, Ecuador insisted that there was no technical basis for considering that mountain range as the border between the two nations, hinting at the idea that the spirit of the Protocol, which had never mentioned the ''C\u00f3ndor'' range by name, would require the location of the border markers along the Cenepa river, immediately to the east of the range.\n\nThe Ecuadorian stance had a symbolic meaning of its own: the Cenepa river was a small tributary of the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river]], in turn a tributary of the [[Amazon river]], to which Ecuador had always claimed the right for a sovereign access.\n\n===Events leading up to the war===\nJust as in the [[Paquisha Incident]] of 1981, the Cenepa War was caused by the installation by Ecuador, since 1994, of border outposts on the Cenepa River basin in eastern Cordillera del Condor (territory of Peru), with the names of Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur and Tiwinza (see the map shown in infobox).\n\nTensions along the Condor range had been running high following a crisis that arose in July 1991 over the location of a Peruvian outpost called \"Pachac\u00fatec\" (Pachac\u00fatec Incident) inside a zone that, while 60&nbsp;km north of the delimited and undemarcated area, had its own problems regarding the location of a single border marker (see map). Ecuador had protested over the location of \"Pachac\u00fatec\" since it was, according to Ecuador, inside Ecuadorian territory, and went on to set up an outpost of its own (\"Etza\") right in front of it.<ref>M.

Although the crisis was defused the following month with the signing of a ''Pacto de Caballeros'' (gentlemen's agreement), by which both sides committed themselves to abandon these posts and separate their forces, the aftermath of the incident saw both countries accusing each other of violating the accord and reinforcing their military presence in the delimited and undemarcated area.\n\n==New crisis==\nStill, for the next three years, tensions were kept at manageable levels. Apart from the uneasy encounters between rival patrols, which sometimes included brief exchanges of fire, most commonly every January (anniversary of the signing of the Rio Protocol), no serious incidents happened.\n\nThen, at the end of 1994, a new crisis suddenly erupted, this time in the undemarcated border area proper, around the Condor range and the Cenepa headwaters.\n\n===\"Base Sur\" and a meeting of colonels===\nPeruvian accounts<ref>''[http://www.caretas.com.pe/1350/asi-empezo/asi-empezo.html \"As\u00ed Empez\u00f3 el Conflicto\"]'', ''Caretas'' magazine, Peru (in Spanish).

The Ecuadorian account of the meeting also states that the Peruvian officer went on to deliver an ultimatum: if the Ecuadorians did not abandon the area by the end of the week, the Peruvians would dislodge them by force.\n\nAfter the meeting \u2014 if not before it \u2014 both Quito and Lima began to send reinforcements to the area, while further meetings between superior officers didn't manage to break the deadlock, apparently unable to reach a compromise solution.\n\n===In retrospect===\nIt could be said that the Cenepa war had the same causes that caused the Peruvian victory in the [[Paquisha War|false Paquisha of 1981]], that is, the Peruvian discovery of Ecuadorian outposts on the eastern slopes of the Condor mountain range by expelled Ecuadorian troops from the territory in dispute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/paquisha-o-la-falsa-historia-98181.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140610234553/http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/paquisha-o-la-falsa-historia-98181.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-06-10|title=Paquisha or the False Story|last=Mena Villamar|first=Claudio|date=|work=|access-date=|publisher=Diary Hoy of Ecuador}}</ref> And further down in the Cenepa Valley, followed by the decision from to evict Ecuadorians from these places by force.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Army, evidently bent on preventing any repetition of the \"Pachac\u00fatec\" incident, and to forestall any Peruvian attempt to reach to crests of the Condor range, had gone on to establish a \"defensive\" perimeter on the area of Cenepa valley, with two outposts, \"Tiwinza\" and \"Base Sur\", on the Cenepa headwaters (i.e. in the eastern side of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, in Peru's land), and a larger outpost, \"Coangos\", on the high ground overlooking them from the north{{ref|herz-44}} (see map).\n\nIn turn, the \"guarantors\" (Warrantors) military considered both Ecuadorian and Peruvian moves as offensive in character, due to the fact that, lacking official border markers, the Ecuadorian and Peruvian military had long since agreed to consider the line of the Condor range a ''de facto'' border, already considered broken by both countries since 1981.\n\n==Mobilizing for war==\nDuring the second half of December both sides began to hastily reinforce their military presence in and around the Cenepa valley area, laying down new minefields, preparing supply bases, and intensifying the patrolling activity.\n\nBy the end of December, profiting from its internal lines of communications, the [[Ecuadorian Army]] had strengthened to a considerable degree its presence in the area, having deployed a number of units, foremost among them several Special Forces formations, as well as artillery and [[9K51 Grad|BM-21]] multiple rocket launchers on the heights of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''. The entire Ecuadorian perimeter was covered by antiaircraft batteries and, most significantly, several teams carrying Soviet-made SA-16 [[9K38 Igla|Igla]] and British-made [[Blowpipe missile|Blowpipe]] [[MANPADS|man-portable surface-to-air missiles]].\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ecuadorian Air Force]] (FAE) was frantically getting up to operational status its fleet of subsonic and supersonic jet aircraft, and adapting existing airfields in southeastern Ecuador to function as forward-deployment bases. For the Ecuadorian military, especially the Army and Air Force, the memories of the conflict of 1981 and its embarrassing outcome were still fresh, the lessons learned, and every measure was taken to avoid a similar outcome if and when the threat of war became a reality.\n\nFor the Peruvian military, the mobilization process was somewhat more problematic. The Cenepa valley area was devoid of any major roads, population centers, or helicopter bases on the Peruvian side. The Peruvian Army and the [[Peruvian Air Force]] (FAP), had to organize an air-bridge to get reinforcements to the zone. Troops, heavy weapons, ammunition and supplies had to be flown in first from the Peruvian hinterland and Lima to Bagua AFB, where they were transferred to light transport aircraft for the flight to the Ciro Alegr\u00eda base. From this base, the final flight to the Peruvian forward bases in the Cenepa valley, mainly Observation Post 1 (PV-1), was made aboard Peru's [[Mil Mi-8]] and [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopter fleet, very often under poor weather conditions, with heavy rain and low cloud cover.<ref name=\"acig.org\"/>\n\nAltogether, by the third week of January, both Peru and Ecuador had managed to deploy around 5,000 troops to the immediate vicinity of the delimited and undemarcated area.<ref>C.

By 8 January the Peruvian Army had deployed four patrols near Base Sur.\nOn the night of 9 January 1995, Ecuadorian troops found and captured four Peruvian soldiers that according to the Ecuadorian accounts were supposedly reconnoitering the approaches to the Ecuadorian outpost of Cueva de los Tayos. Following the customary regulations put in place by both Armies for the handling of such instances, the so-called ''Cartillas de Seguridad y Confianza'' (Guidelines for Safety and Mutual Confidence), the captured Peruvian personnel were delivered to their own officers without further incident.\n\nAlways following the Ecuadorian accounts, a subsequent incident took place two days later, on January 11, when another Peruvian patrol was detected near a place called the \"Y\", a point of tactical importance in the Ecuadorian lines. Shots were fired, apparently causing no casualties on either side.\n\n==Open war==\n[[File:CENEPA.jpg|thumb|Peruvian commandos during the war.]]\nBy the third week of January, the Peruvian high command had deployed to the Cenepa area what it considered to be enough troops to clear any and all Ecuadorian troops on the Eastern side of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor. In retrospect, it is likely that Lima was expecting a repetition of the 1981 incident, unaware of the scale of the Ecuadorian deployment. Thus, as a preliminary to the attack, on 21 January Peruvian helicopters began a series of reconnaissance and troop insertion flights on the rear of the Ecuadorian positions, which continued for the next two days. The next day, 22 January, the Ecuadorians detected around twenty Peruvian troops setting up a heliport to the north and rear of the Ecuadorian forward outposts.\n\nThe stepping up of the Peruvian air operations, combined with the surprise discovery of a Peruvian base on the rear of the Ecuadorian perimeter, compelled the Ecuadorian high command to take the initiative. That same day, a reinforced Special Forces company was ordered to advance undetected through the dense jungle and dislodge the Peruvians from the site, named by the Ecuadorians' \"Base Norte\".<ref>Herz, p. 43.</ref> Significantly, the decision to act was made by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army before informing the President of the Republic, [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n]], and his National Security Council.\n\nThe Ecuadorian high command had by then interpreted the opinion of the Commander in Chief of the Peruvian armed forces, General [[Nicol\u00e1s de Bari Hermoza]], to respond to calls from his Ecuadorian counterpart as a signal that the Peruvian military, with or without the knowledge of Peruvian President [[Alberto Fujimori]], was preparing a military operation in the Cenepa valley.\n\nThe next day, the decision to act already taken, the Ecuadorian local commander informed his Peruvian counterpart that, from 24 January onwards, any Peruvian helicopter flying over Ecuadorian positions would be shot down.  On the morning of Thursday, 26 January 1995, after three days of march, the Ecuadorian Special Forces detachment arrived undetected at the small Peruvian outpost \"Base Norte\" and launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting garrison. A fierce firefight ensued, but the Peruvians were eventually forced to disperse through the jungle, leaving behind a number of dead soldiers, as well as weapons and supplies. The Cenepa War had begun.\n\nBut it was the Peruvian troops that finally evicted the Ecuadorian troops from their territory after the intense bombardment by land and air of the bases of the Cave of the Tayos, the South Base and the false Tiwinza. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laprensaderjl.blogspot.com/2010/01/la-guerra-del-cenepa-es-para-celebrar-o.html|title=Is it the Cenepa War to celebrate or mourn our dead?|last=|first=|date=January 27, 2010|website=La Prensa RJL, Ecuador|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><br />\n\n===Chronology of the War===\nThe following days, the events unfolded in quick succession.

In accordance with the Treaty of Itamaraty and the Declaration of Montevideo, the Ecuadorians began to withdraw all their units to the base of Coangos, while the Peruvians were to do the same to PV-1. From there, troops would be extracted according to a schedule implement by the MOMEP.  All combatants were withdrawn from the delimited and undemarcated area by May 5, 1995. A [[demilitarized zone]] came into effect on August 4 of the same year. Ecuador and Peru went on to negotiate the final demarcation of the border, in a lengthy process marked by one crisis after another, with a total war almost erupting in August 1998. Finally, on October 26, 1998, in [[Bras\u00edlia]], [[Jamil Mahuad]], President of Ecuador, and [[Alberto Fujimori]], President of Peru, along with the Presidents of [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]]; and a personal representative of the President of the United States of America, signed a Presidential Act, which proclaimed \"the definitive resolution of the border disputes between the two nations\".<ref>Cuvi, p. 242.</ref>\n\nIn a decision that certain political sectors on both sides took as a setback, the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol determined that the boundary of the delimited and undemarcated zone was in fact the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor line, as Peru had been claiming from the 1940s. While Ecuador was forced to renounce its decades-old territorial claims as Tumbes, Jaen and Maynas as well as on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, as well as the entire western area of the Cenepa headwaters, Peru \"gives\" to Ecuador, as a \"private property\" but without sovereignty and only for commemorative and non-military events, one square kilometer of its territory, in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza was located (level 1061), focal point of the war, inside the Peruvian soil, anyone born in Tiwinza will be considered Peruvian.

The source of this deal has been traced back to 1977, when the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|military regime of Augusto Pinochet]] signed an agreement with the Ecuadorian military authorities then ruling the country (headed by [[Alfredo Poveda]]) for the sale of armament by the state-run [[FAMAE]] factory.

Nonetheless, the Peruvian government at that time regarded this as a minor incident due to the Chilean Sub-secretary of Foreign Relations, Mariano Fern\u00e1ndez, telling the Peruvian ambassador in Chile, Alfonso de Rivero, on February 2, 1995, that the Chilean government would take immediate measures to stop any other possible operations of this nature.<ref name=MREP/> In this communication, Fern\u00e1ndez is reported to have concurred to de Rivero's residence and revealed that only 9mm ammunition, which had been paid with anticipation, had been loaded in the Ecuadorian planes; that a Chilean lawyer representing Ecuador had demanded the fulfillment of the contract and that Ecuadorian military personnel who came on the plane asked for additional armament, only to have this petition denied; however Peruvian ''[[Caretas]]'' magazine reported that part of this information wasn't precise (without specifying which part). Apparently, the Chilean authorities were being sincere, as [[President of Chile|President]] [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Frei]] only took notice of the departure of the Ecuadorian Hercules planes (loaded only with ammunition) hours after they had left.<ref name=Caretas/>\n\nChile's response to the declarations made by General Bayas were made the following day on March 22, 2005. The government of Chile denied the claims and stated that the only registered sale of weapons to Ecuador was in 1994. Jaime Ravinet, the Chilean [[Minister of Defense]], assured that any other armament transfer after the 1994 date had been illegal. Ravinet further stated that, after discussing the matter with his Peruvian counterpart, Roberto Chiabra, the situation had been resolved.<ref name=Clarin/> Yet, the Peruvian government did not find the February 5, 1995, and March 22, 2005, declarations as acceptable or sufficient; and went on to send a note of protest to the Chilean government. Peru further claimed that Chile should have maintained absolute neutrality and that this alleged weapons commerce during the Cenepa War went against resolutions made by the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]].<ref name=MREP/><ref name=Clarin/>\n\nIn the end, the whole operation was revealed to be the planning of former dictator Pinochet, then chief of the [[Chilean Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] (until 1998). Quoting Peruvian ambassador to Chile in 1995 (de Rivero), the Chilean Sub-secretary (Fern\u00e1ndez) \"''pointed out to me that President Frei and chancellor (foreign minister) [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza|Insulza]] had been deeply worried by the situation and that they were taking all the dispositions of the case to reform the military sales law''\". Reportedly, Pinochet himself later assumed direct responsibility for the shipment before the civilian authorities of his country (even if his lawyer denied it in 2005<ref>https://www.eluniverso.com/2005/04/14/0001/8/9640FE8217124A6A8FA9A4EB7C035E14.html</ref>), as he still exercised considerable [[state within a state|influence over state institutions]] and controlled the security apparatus, thus having power to bypass civilian controls to foreign arms sales.<ref name=Caretas/> It is worth noting that Pinochet, who had lived in Ecuador during the second half of the 1950s as a military instructor, had a deep affection towards the country and, a couple of years later, in November\u2013December 1997, made a controversial and highly publicized visit to Ecuador where he attended a series of ceremonies and was given six military and civilian decorations by that country's civilian and military authorities.<ref name=\"Inter Press Service\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnoticias.net/1997/12/ecuador-pinochet-entre-el-odio-y-el-amor-de-los-ecuatorianos/|title=ECUADOR: Pinochet, entre el amor y el odio de los ecuatorianos|work=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=December 2, 1997|accessdate=2017-11-01}} (in Spanish)</ref><ref name=\"EL PAIS\">{{citeweb|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1997/11/29/internacional/880758012_850215.html|title=Aplauso militar y rechazo civil a la visita de Pinochet a Ecuador|work=[[EL PA\u00cdS]]|date=November 29, 1997|accessdate=1 November 2017}} (in Spanish)</ref>\n\n====Argentina====\nArgentina admitted to the illegal sale of armament by revealing the existence of three secret decrees signed by President [[Carlos Menem]] between the years of 1991 and 1995.

Some of these can be briefly summarized here:\n\n*'''Logistics'''. Both during the buildup of forces and during the clashes of January and February, the Peruvian Army found itself at a logistical disadvantage. The fact that all reinforcements and supplies had to be flown in by helicopter from Ciro Alegr\u00eda base, more than 110&nbsp;km to the south, meant that, in general, the Ecuadorian forces went into combat better armed and supplied. Moreover, once the shooting war started, the Cenepa valley became a rather dangerous place for the Peruvian [[Mil Mi-8]] and [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters, which besides their transport duties also carried out ground-attack missions.\n*'''Force Composition'''. Right from the very first clashes, the Ecuadorian Army committed Special Forces units all along the combat area. In addition to the paratroopers, the Ecuadorians sent into battle a number of \"Iwia\" detachments \u2014 units composed of tribal people such as the [[Shuar people]], specialized in jungle combat and survival. Until the arrival of some elite counterinsurgency units from the south (battle-hardened [[Internal conflict in Peru|by a leftist insurgency]]) the Peruvian forces committed to the battle were composed mostly of young and inexperienced conscripts.\n*'''Terrain'''. In 1995, the Ecuadorian Army fought on terrain of its own choosing. From the heights of the Condor mountain range, the Ecuadorians had a commanding view of the entire combat area. The Ecuadorian artillery -carefully camouflaged on the reverse slopes of the Condor range- could deliver precise and deadly fire upon attacking Peruvian troops. By the same token, the Ecuadorian antiaircraft batteries and SAMs located on the heights made helicopter low-level flight into the valley a dangerous proposition.\n*'''State of the opposing air forces at the outbreak of the crisis'''. The war of 1995 came at a bad moment for the Peruvian Air Force, as the economic crisis that had struck the nation in the 1980s had a negative impact on the readiness of the FAP. At the beginning of January 1995, with a crisis looming on the horizon, the FAP found itself in no shape for a major air war. Most of its fleet of modern Mirage 2000Ps interceptors, bought in the mid-1980s and the backbone of the FAP, was grounded for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance due to lack of funds. Only three [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000Ps]] were immediately available for active operations. Its fleet of [[Sukhoi Su-22]] fighter-bombers was in the same situation, with some seven aircraft in flying condition; the lack of preparedness even affected the Cessna A-37B subsonic counterinsurgency and ground-attack aircraft.<ref name=\"acig.org\"/> Although by the end of January the situation regarding operational aircraft had greatly improved, the crisis had probably left its impact on the FAP. Ecuador had also passed through a period of economic crisis of its own, but the FAE had kept in operational status a sizeable part of its fleet of Mirage F.1JAs, IAI Kfir C.2s, and [[SEPECAT Jaguar]]s, with perhaps some ten Mirages, ten Kfirs, and four or six Jaguars in serviceable condition. Thus, while smaller in total number of planes, the FAE of January 1995 felt qualitatively capable of facing the FAP on equal terms - in striking contrast to the situation during the crisis of 1981, where except for a small number of missions, the FAE had been kept on the ground armed and ready for immediate action, to be committed only in case of a full-fledged war. In 1995 their positions in the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor were well defended due to tactically placed SAMs, and units armed with British-made [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe missiles]] and Russian-made [[SA-16]] [[MANPADS]]. Nevertheless, such defences didn't stop the continuous raids of the [[Peruvian Air Force]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]]\n*[[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]]\n*[[Paquisha Incident]]\n*[[Post\u2013World War II air-to-air combat losses]]\n*[[Luis Garc\u00eda Rojas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://peacemaker.un.org/eduador-peru-montevideo-declaration95 Full text of the Montevideo Declaration, UN Peacemaker]\n*B.

The two nations had signed a border treaty following the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]] of 1941, but Ecuador later disagreed with the treaty as it applied to the Cenepa and Paquisha areas, and in 1960 Ecuador declared the treaty null and void.\n\nMediation efforts of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and the [[United States]] paved the way for the opening of diplomatic conversations that ultimately led to the signing of a definitive peace agreement (the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]) on 26 October 1998.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas# |title=Database - Uppsala Conflict Data Program |publisher=UCDP.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas |archive-date=2013-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999 which effectively put an end to one of the longest territorial disputes in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/>\n\nIt is, as of 2020, the most recent military conflict in the Americas between countries contesting sovereignty over territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\nThe Cenepa War was the most recent military clash between Ecuador and Peru over a long-standing territorial dispute that dated back to the first decades of the 19th century, when both countries came into being after the Wars of Independence of the Spanish colonies in South America.\n\nIn modern times there were three previous military confrontations: [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857\u201360|War Ecuadorian-Peruvian 1858]], a [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|full-scale war in 1941]], and a [[Paquisha War|brief clash in 1981]], both of which had seen the [[Peruvian military]] forces prevailing over the [[Ecuadorian military]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Image:Ecuador-Peru-Frontera.svg|thumb|left|350px|Ecuador-Per\u00fa border]]\nMost of the fighting of the Cenepa war was centered around the control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the [[Cenepa River]] (see map), a highland area covered with dense Amazonian jungle, inside a 78&nbsp;km-long strip of territory where the process of demarcation between Ecuador and Peru remained stalled since 1951.\n\nOne of the outposts causing the dispute, called '''Tiwintza''' by the Ecuadorians, and Tiwinza by the Peruvians, came to symbolize the war because of the bitter clashes that took place around it, and the emotional importance that both sides attached to its possession. The conflict continued until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces, supervised by the MOMEP, a multinational mission of military observers from the \"guarantor\" countries of the 1942 [[Rio Protocol]]: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the USA.\n\nThe Cenepa war ended up producing far-reaching consequences for relations between Ecuador and Peru. The military outcome of the brief conflict, no vindicating the Ecuadorian armed forces after the disappointing results of the war of 1858, 1941, 1981, and by calling to the attention of the Peruvians the need for a resolution of a problem, paved the way for a definitive settlement of the border issues.\n\nThus, in the aftermath of the war, both nations, brokered by the \"guarantors\" of the Rio Protocol, entered into a long and difficult negotiation process that concluded with the signing of a [[Peace Treaty]] in 1998, and the closing of the hitherto un-demarcated stretch of common border, deep in the Amazonian rainforest.\n\n===Disputed border===\nFollowing the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]] of 1941, both countries had signed in 1942 a Peace Treaty known as the [[Rio Protocol]]. This treaty \u2014 brokered by the US, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, which became known as the \"guarantors\" of the peace settlement \u2014 had the main purpose of defining the hitherto badly defined borders between Ecuador and Peru. The process of demarcation, begun in mid-1942, came to a halt in 1948, when populist Ecuadorian President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] declared the Protocol impossible to implement in the area of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'', claiming inconsistencies between the instructions of the Protocol and the geographical realities on the ground.\n\nPeru contested this view, stating that such discrepancies had already been solved in an arbitration that had taken place in 1945, and that all that had to be done was to close the border following the guidelines of the Protocol and the ruling of the 1945 arbitration\n\nBy the beginning of the 1950s, the situation had come to a deadlock. For the next 46 years, a 78&nbsp;km-long strip of mostly unpopulated, and little explored territory, deep in the Amazonian rainforest and almost inaccessible by land, was left undemarcated, serving as a flashpoint for recurrent diplomatic and military crisis between Ecuador and Peru.\nWhile Peru held to the view that the border in the undermarcated area ran along the heights of the Condor range, Ecuador insisted that there was no technical basis for considering that mountain range as the border between the two nations, hinting at the idea that the spirit of the Protocol, which had never mentioned the ''C\u00f3ndor'' range by name, would require the location of the border markers along the Cenepa river, immediately to the east of the range.\n\nThe Ecuadorian stance had a symbolic meaning of its own: the Cenepa river was a small tributary of the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river]], in turn a tributary of the [[Amazon river]], to which Ecuador had always claimed the right for a sovereign access.\n\n===Events leading up to the war===\nJust as in the [[Paquisha Incident]] of 1981, the Cenepa War was caused by the installation by Ecuador, since 1994, of border outposts on the Cenepa River basin in eastern Cordillera del Condor (territory of Peru), with the names of Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur and Tiwinza (see the map shown in infobox).\n\nTensions along the Condor range had been running high following a crisis that arose in July 1991 over the location of a Peruvian outpost called \"Pachac\u00fatec\" (Pachac\u00fatec Incident) inside a zone that, while 60&nbsp;km north of the delimited and undemarcated area, had its own problems regarding the location of a single border marker (see map). Ecuador had protested over the location of \"Pachac\u00fatec\" since it was, according to Ecuador, inside Ecuadorian territory, and went on to set up an outpost of its own (\"Etza\") right in front of it.<ref>M.

Although the crisis was defused the following month with the signing of a ''Pacto de Caballeros'' (gentlemen's agreement), by which both sides committed themselves to abandon these posts and separate their forces, the aftermath of the incident saw both countries accusing each other of violating the accord and reinforcing their military presence in the delimited and undemarcated area.\n\n==New crisis==\nStill, for the next three years, tensions were kept at manageable levels. Apart from the uneasy encounters between rival patrols, which sometimes included brief exchanges of fire, most commonly every January (anniversary of the signing of the Rio Protocol), no serious incidents happened.\n\nThen, at the end of 1994, a new crisis suddenly erupted, this time in the undemarcated border area proper, around the Condor range and the Cenepa headwaters.\n\n===\"Base Sur\" and a meeting of colonels===\nPeruvian accounts<ref>''[http://www.caretas.com.pe/1350/asi-empezo/asi-empezo.html \"As\u00ed Empez\u00f3 el Conflicto\"]'', ''Caretas'' magazine, Peru (in Spanish).

The Ecuadorian account of the meeting also states that the Peruvian officer went on to deliver an ultimatum: if the Ecuadorians did not abandon the area by the end of the week, the Peruvians would dislodge them by force.\n\nAfter the meeting \u2014 if not before it \u2014 both Quito and Lima began to send reinforcements to the area, while further meetings between superior officers didn't manage to break the deadlock, apparently unable to reach a compromise solution.\n\n===In retrospect===\nIt could be said that the Cenepa war had the same causes that caused the Peruvian victory in the [[Paquisha War|false Paquisha of 1981]], that is, the Peruvian discovery of Ecuadorian outposts on the eastern slopes of the Condor mountain range by expelled Ecuadorian troops from the territory in dispute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/paquisha-o-la-falsa-historia-98181.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140610234553/http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/paquisha-o-la-falsa-historia-98181.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-06-10|title=Paquisha or the False Story|last=Mena Villamar|first=Claudio|date=|work=|access-date=|publisher=Diary Hoy of Ecuador}}</ref> And further down in the Cenepa Valley, followed by the decision from to evict Ecuadorians from these places by force.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Army, evidently bent on preventing any repetition of the \"Pachac\u00fatec\" incident, and to forestall any Peruvian attempt to reach to crests of the Condor range, had gone on to establish a \"defensive\" perimeter on the area of Cenepa valley, with two outposts, \"Tiwinza\" and \"Base Sur\", on the Cenepa headwaters (i.e. in the eastern side of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, in Peru's land), and a larger outpost, \"Coangos\", on the high ground overlooking them from the north{{ref|herz-44}} (see map).\n\nIn turn, the \"guarantors\" (Warrantors) military considered both Ecuadorian and Peruvian moves as offensive in character, due to the fact that, lacking official border markers, the Ecuadorian and Peruvian military had long since agreed to consider the line of the Condor range a ''de facto'' border, already considered broken by both countries since 1981.\n\n==Mobilizing for war==\nDuring the second half of December both sides began to hastily reinforce their military presence in and around the Cenepa valley area, laying down new minefields, preparing supply bases, and intensifying the patrolling activity.\n\nBy the end of December, profiting from its internal lines of communications, the [[Ecuadorian Army]] had strengthened to a considerable degree its presence in the area, having deployed a number of units, foremost among them several Special Forces formations, as well as artillery and [[9K51 Grad|BM-21]] multiple rocket launchers on the heights of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''. The entire Ecuadorian perimeter was covered by antiaircraft batteries and, most significantly, several teams carrying Soviet-made SA-16 [[9K38 Igla|Igla]] and British-made [[Blowpipe missile|Blowpipe]] [[MANPADS|man-portable surface-to-air missiles]].\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ecuadorian Air Force]] (FAE) was frantically getting up to operational status its fleet of subsonic and supersonic jet aircraft, and adapting existing airfields in southeastern Ecuador to function as forward-deployment bases. For the Ecuadorian military, especially the Army and Air Force, the memories of the conflict of 1981 and its embarrassing outcome were still fresh, the lessons learned, and every measure was taken to avoid a similar outcome if and when the threat of war became a reality.\n\nFor the Peruvian military, the mobilization process was somewhat more problematic. The Cenepa valley area was devoid of any major roads, population centers, or helicopter bases on the Peruvian side. The Peruvian Army and the [[Peruvian Air Force]] (FAP), had to organize an air-bridge to get reinforcements to the zone. Troops, heavy weapons, ammunition and supplies had to be flown in first from the Peruvian hinterland and Lima to Bagua AFB, where they were transferred to light transport aircraft for the flight to the Ciro Alegr\u00eda base. From this base, the final flight to the Peruvian forward bases in the Cenepa valley, mainly Observation Post 1 (PV-1), was made aboard Peru's [[Mil Mi-8]] and [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopter fleet, very often under poor weather conditions, with heavy rain and low cloud cover.<ref name=\"acig.org\"/>\n\nAltogether, by the third week of January, both Peru and Ecuador had managed to deploy around 5,000 troops to the immediate vicinity of the delimited and undemarcated area.<ref>C.

By 8 January the Peruvian Army had deployed four patrols near Base Sur.\nOn the night of 9 January 1995, Ecuadorian troops found and captured four Peruvian soldiers that according to the Ecuadorian accounts were supposedly reconnoitering the approaches to the Ecuadorian outpost of Cueva de los Tayos. Following the customary regulations put in place by both Armies for the handling of such instances, the so-called ''Cartillas de Seguridad y Confianza'' (Guidelines for Safety and Mutual Confidence), the captured Peruvian personnel were delivered to their own officers without further incident.\n\nAlways following the Ecuadorian accounts, a subsequent incident took place two days later, on January 11, when another Peruvian patrol was detected near a place called the \"Y\", a point of tactical importance in the Ecuadorian lines. Shots were fired, apparently causing no casualties on either side.\n\n==Open war==\n[[File:CENEPA.jpg|thumb|Peruvian commandos during the war.]]\nBy the third week of January, the Peruvian high command had deployed to the Cenepa area what it considered to be enough troops to clear any and all Ecuadorian troops on the Eastern side of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor. In retrospect, it is likely that Lima was expecting a repetition of the 1981 incident, unaware of the scale of the Ecuadorian deployment. Thus, as a preliminary to the attack, on 21 January Peruvian helicopters began a series of reconnaissance and troop insertion flights on the rear of the Ecuadorian positions, which continued for the next two days. The next day, 22 January, the Ecuadorians detected around twenty Peruvian troops setting up a heliport to the north and rear of the Ecuadorian forward outposts.\n\nThe stepping up of the Peruvian air operations, combined with the surprise discovery of a Peruvian base on the rear of the Ecuadorian perimeter, compelled the Ecuadorian high command to take the initiative. That same day, a reinforced Special Forces company was ordered to advance undetected through the dense jungle and dislodge the Peruvians from the site, named by the Ecuadorians' \"Base Norte\".<ref>Herz, p. 43.</ref> Significantly, the decision to act was made by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army before informing the President of the Republic, [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n]], and his National Security Council.\n\nThe Ecuadorian high command had by then interpreted the opinion of the Commander in Chief of the Peruvian armed forces, General [[Nicol\u00e1s de Bari Hermoza]], to respond to calls from his Ecuadorian counterpart as a signal that the Peruvian military, with or without the knowledge of Peruvian President [[Alberto Fujimori]], was preparing a military operation in the Cenepa valley.\n\nThe next day, the decision to act already taken, the Ecuadorian local commander informed his Peruvian counterpart that, from 24 January onwards, any Peruvian helicopter flying over Ecuadorian positions would be shot down.  On the morning of Thursday, 26 January 1995, after three days of march, the Ecuadorian Special Forces detachment arrived undetected at the small Peruvian outpost \"Base Norte\" and launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting garrison. A fierce firefight ensued, but the Peruvians were eventually forced to disperse through the jungle, leaving behind a number of dead soldiers, as well as weapons and supplies. The Cenepa War had begun.\n\nBut it was the Peruvian troops that finally evicted the Ecuadorian troops from their territory after the intense bombardment by land and air of the bases of the Cave of the Tayos, the South Base and the false Tiwinza. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laprensaderjl.blogspot.com/2010/01/la-guerra-del-cenepa-es-para-celebrar-o.html|title=Is it the Cenepa War to celebrate or mourn our dead?|last=|first=|date=January 27, 2010|website=La Prensa RJL, Ecuador|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><br />\n\n===Chronology of the War===\nThe following days, the events unfolded in quick succession.

In accordance with the Treaty of Itamaraty and the Declaration of Montevideo, the Ecuadorians began to withdraw all their units to the base of Coangos, while the Peruvians were to do the same to PV-1. From there, troops would be extracted according to a schedule implement by the MOMEP.  All combatants were withdrawn from the delimited and undemarcated area by May 5, 1995. A [[demilitarized zone]] came into effect on August 4 of the same year. Ecuador and Peru went on to negotiate the final demarcation of the border, in a lengthy process marked by one crisis after another, with a total war almost erupting in August 1998. Finally, on October 26, 1998, in [[Bras\u00edlia]], [[Jamil Mahuad]], President of Ecuador, and [[Alberto Fujimori]], President of Peru, along with the Presidents of [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]]; and a personal representative of the President of the United States of America, signed a Presidential Act, which proclaimed \"the definitive resolution of the border disputes between the two nations\".<ref>Cuvi, p. 242.</ref>\n\nIn a decision that certain political sectors on both sides took as a setback, the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol determined that the boundary of the delimited and undemarcated zone was in fact the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor line, as Peru had been claiming from the 1940s. While Ecuador was forced to renounce its decades-old territorial claims as Tumbes, Jaen and Maynas as well as on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, as well as the entire western area of the Cenepa headwaters, Peru \"gives\" to Ecuador, as a \"private property\" but without sovereignty and only for commemorative and non-military events, one square kilometer of its territory, in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza was located (level 1061), focal point of the war, inside the Peruvian soil, anyone born in Tiwinza will be considered Peruvian. The final demarcation of the border came into effect on May 13, 1999.\n\n===Casualties and material losses===\nFigures given for losses during the Cenepa War vary widely, especially regarding human casualties.

The source of this deal has been traced back to 1977, when the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|military regime of Augusto Pinochet]] signed an agreement with the Ecuadorian military authorities then ruling the country (headed by [[Alfredo Poveda]]) for the sale of armament by the state-run [[FAMAE]] factory.

Nonetheless, the Peruvian government at that time regarded this as a minor incident due to the Chilean Sub-secretary of Foreign Relations, Mariano Fern\u00e1ndez, telling the Peruvian ambassador in Chile, Alfonso de Rivero, on February 2, 1995, that the Chilean government would take immediate measures to stop any other possible operations of this nature.<ref name=MREP/> In this communication, Fern\u00e1ndez is reported to have concurred to de Rivero's residence and revealed that only 9mm ammunition, which had been paid with anticipation, had been loaded in the Ecuadorian planes; that a Chilean lawyer representing Ecuador had demanded the fulfillment of the contract and that Ecuadorian military personnel who came on the plane asked for additional armament, only to have this petition denied; however Peruvian ''[[Caretas]]'' magazine reported that part of this information wasn't precise (without specifying which part). Apparently, the Chilean authorities were being sincere, as [[President of Chile|President]] [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Frei]] only took notice of the departure of the Ecuadorian Hercules planes (loaded only with ammunition) hours after they had left.<ref name=Caretas/>\n\nChile's response to the declarations made by General Bayas were made the following day on March 22, 2005. The government of Chile denied the claims and stated that the only registered sale of weapons to Ecuador was in 1994. Jaime Ravinet, the Chilean [[Minister of Defense]], assured that any other armament transfer after the 1994 date had been illegal. Ravinet further stated that, after discussing the matter with his Peruvian counterpart, Roberto Chiabra, the situation had been resolved.<ref name=Clarin/> Yet, the Peruvian government did not find the February 5, 1995, and March 22, 2005, declarations as acceptable or sufficient; and went on to send a note of protest to the Chilean government. Peru further claimed that Chile should have maintained absolute neutrality and that this alleged weapons commerce during the Cenepa War went against resolutions made by the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]].<ref name=MREP/><ref name=Clarin/>\n\nIn the end, the whole operation was revealed to be the planning of former dictator Pinochet, then chief of the [[Chilean Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] (until 1998). Quoting Peruvian ambassador to Chile in 1995 (de Rivero), the Chilean Sub-secretary (Fern\u00e1ndez) \"''pointed out to me that President Frei and chancellor (foreign minister) [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza|Insulza]] had been deeply worried by the situation and that they were taking all the dispositions of the case to reform the military sales law''\". Reportedly, Pinochet himself later assumed direct responsibility for the shipment before the civilian authorities of his country (even if his lawyer denied it in 2005<ref>https://www.eluniverso.com/2005/04/14/0001/8/9640FE8217124A6A8FA9A4EB7C035E14.html</ref>), as he still exercised considerable [[state within a state|influence over state institutions]] and controlled the security apparatus, thus having power to bypass civilian controls to foreign arms sales.<ref name=Caretas/> It is worth noting that Pinochet, who had lived in Ecuador during the second half of the 1950s as a military instructor, had a deep affection towards the country and, a couple of years later, in November\u2013December 1997, made a controversial and highly publicized visit to Ecuador where he attended a series of ceremonies and was given six military and civilian decorations by that country's civilian and military authorities.<ref name=\"Inter Press Service\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnoticias.net/1997/12/ecuador-pinochet-entre-el-odio-y-el-amor-de-los-ecuatorianos/|title=ECUADOR: Pinochet, entre el amor y el odio de los ecuatorianos|work=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=December 2, 1997|accessdate=2017-11-01}} (in Spanish)</ref><ref name=\"EL PAIS\">{{citeweb|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1997/11/29/internacional/880758012_850215.html|title=Aplauso militar y rechazo civil a la visita de Pinochet a Ecuador|work=[[EL PA\u00cdS]]|date=November 29, 1997|accessdate=1 November 2017}} (in Spanish)</ref>\n\n====Argentina====\nArgentina admitted to the illegal sale of armament by revealing the existence of three secret decrees signed by President [[Carlos Menem]] between the years of 1991 and 1995.

Some of these can be briefly summarized here:\n\n*'''Logistics'''. Both during the buildup of forces and during the clashes of January and February, the Peruvian Army found itself at a logistical disadvantage. The fact that all reinforcements and supplies had to be flown in by helicopter from Ciro Alegr\u00eda base, more than 110&nbsp;km to the south, meant that, in general, the Ecuadorian forces went into combat better armed and supplied. Moreover, once the shooting war started, the Cenepa valley became a rather dangerous place for the Peruvian [[Mil Mi-8]] and [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters, which besides their transport duties also carried out ground-attack missions.\n*'''Force Composition'''. Right from the very first clashes, the Ecuadorian Army committed Special Forces units all along the combat area. In addition to the paratroopers, the Ecuadorians sent into battle a number of \"Iwia\" detachments \u2014 units composed of tribal people such as the [[Shuar people]], specialized in jungle combat and survival. Until the arrival of some elite counterinsurgency units from the south (battle-hardened [[Internal conflict in Peru|by a leftist insurgency]]) the Peruvian forces committed to the battle were composed mostly of young and inexperienced conscripts.\n*'''Terrain'''. In 1995, the Ecuadorian Army fought on terrain of its own choosing. From the heights of the Condor mountain range, the Ecuadorians had a commanding view of the entire combat area. The Ecuadorian artillery -carefully camouflaged on the reverse slopes of the Condor range- could deliver precise and deadly fire upon attacking Peruvian troops. By the same token, the Ecuadorian antiaircraft batteries and SAMs located on the heights made helicopter low-level flight into the valley a dangerous proposition.\n*'''State of the opposing air forces at the outbreak of the crisis'''. The war of 1995 came at a bad moment for the Peruvian Air Force, as the economic crisis that had struck the nation in the 1980s had a negative impact on the readiness of the FAP. At the beginning of January 1995, with a crisis looming on the horizon, the FAP found itself in no shape for a major air war. Most of its fleet of modern Mirage 2000Ps interceptors, bought in the mid-1980s and the backbone of the FAP, was grounded for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance due to lack of funds. Only three [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000Ps]] were immediately available for active operations. Its fleet of [[Sukhoi Su-22]] fighter-bombers was in the same situation, with some seven aircraft in flying condition; the lack of preparedness even affected the Cessna A-37B subsonic counterinsurgency and ground-attack aircraft.<ref name=\"acig.org\"/> Although by the end of January the situation regarding operational aircraft had greatly improved, the crisis had probably left its impact on the FAP. Ecuador had also passed through a period of economic crisis of its own, but the FAE had kept in operational status a sizeable part of its fleet of Mirage F.1JAs, IAI Kfir C.2s, and [[SEPECAT Jaguar]]s, with perhaps some ten Mirages, ten Kfirs, and four or six Jaguars in serviceable condition. Thus, while smaller in total number of planes, the FAE of January 1995 felt qualitatively capable of facing the FAP on equal terms - in striking contrast to the situation during the crisis of 1981, where except for a small number of missions, the FAE had been kept on the ground armed and ready for immediate action, to be committed only in case of a full-fledged war. In 1995 their positions in the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor were well defended due to tactically placed SAMs, and units armed with British-made [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe missiles]] and Russian-made [[SA-16]] [[MANPADS]]. Nevertheless, such defences didn't stop the continuous raids of the [[Peruvian Air Force]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]]\n*[[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]]\n*[[Paquisha Incident]]\n*[[Post\u2013World War II air-to-air combat losses]]\n*[[Luis Garc\u00eda Rojas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://peacemaker.un.org/eduador-peru-montevideo-declaration95 Full text of the Montevideo Declaration, UN Peacemaker]\n*B.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
