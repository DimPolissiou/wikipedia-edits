The modern-day incarnation of Loki first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #85 (October 1962). The character, which is based on the [[Loki|Norse deity of the same name]], is the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god of mischief and adopted child of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and sibling of the [[superhero]]es [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], themselves shown as both a [[supervillain]] and [[antihero]]. The character is [[genderfluid]], having been depicted as both [[male]] and [[female]].\n\nLoki has appeared in several ongoing series, [[limited series (comics)|limited series]] and alternate reality series, including the 4-issue series ''Loki'' in 2004 and 2006, being the main character of ''Journey into Mystery'' from issues 622 to 645, appearing in new issues of ''[[Young Avengers]]'' in 2013 and receiving two more solo series, ''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' in 2013 and ''Vote Loki'' in 2016.

Described this precise way in secondary sources, or is it just a cute bit of trivia that some Timely Comics share continuity with later Marvel works, and both happened to feature characters named for Odin's adopted sibling, that some Wikipedian decided was worth mentioning? Because the latter is the definition of OR. Also: \"the traditional image of the Devil\"!?|date=June 2018}} Planning to spread hate, he convinced [[Jupiter]] to let him into the realm Earth, using Venus already being allowed onto it as his justification. Venus pledged herself to Loki's service in order to stop his plans, with Jupiter seeing her unselfish act and freeing her from the pledge, with Loki subsequently being sent back to the Underworld. The modern-age Loki made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nAs one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki has frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> As well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series, he was the starring character in two four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Loki'' in 2004 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mayerson, Ginger |author2=Poonsombat, Nirut |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |title=Interview: Esad Ribi\u0107 |publisher=The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society Miscellanea and Ephemeron |date=November 9, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502034356/http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27138 |title=Aguirre-Sacasa Gets Mischievous With \"Loki\" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |title=AGUIRRE-SACASA Details LOKI's Origin in October |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716173604/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |archive-date=July 16, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLoki played a key role in the 2010s company-wide ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, in which the character is eventually killed.\n\nStarting with issue No. 622 the ongoing series ''Thor'' reverted to the original title ''Journey into Mystery'' and shifted focus to Loki.

The sorcerer caught him unaware, turning Bor into snow. Bor's son, [[Odin (character)|Odin]], found his father as he was blowing away; Bor begged Odin to find a sorcerer to free him, but Odin made no attempt to save his father. Bor cursed Odin saying that he would take in the son of a fallen king and raise it as his own. Not a week later, Odin himself led the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] into battle against the Frost Giants and killed [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], who was the King, in personal combat. After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants. The child was Loki; Laufey having kept him hidden from the Frost Giant people due to his shame over his sons small size. Odin took the child, out of a combination of pity, to appease the memory of his father, and because he was the child of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised as his own alongside his biological son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol 3 #7\u20138 (May, June 2008)</ref>\n\nThroughout his childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences between how Thor and himself were treated by the citizens of Asgard.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Studios Visual Dictionary|last=Bray|first=Adam|publisher=Marvel|year=2018|isbn=9781465476371|location=New York, New York|pages=70}}</ref> The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things, and Loki was clearly inferior to his brother Thor in those areas. What he lacked in size and strength, however, he made up for in power and skill, particularly as a [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcerer]]. As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest and earned him a nickname as the \"God of Mischief\"; his mischievousness eventually became malice as his hunger for power and revenge grew stronger. Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor, such as telling him to guard a hole in the wall that he himself had made. In time, his reputation grew from being a playful and mischievous [[trickster]] to the \"God of [[Evil]]\". Over the centuries, Loki attempted on many occasions to seize the rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor, even helping the Storm Giant Ghan to escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later, and aided other enemies of Asgard, planning to take over. Odin, who had grown weary of Loki's mischief, magically imprisoned him within a tree until someone would shed a tear for his plight. Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], the guardian of [[Bifrost]], in the eye, which made him shed a tear. Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in Asgard, and was frequently exiled.<ref>[[Matt Fraction]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), ''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' #1 (April 30, 2008), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> He later met the Sorcerer Eldred, who taught him [[black magic]], repaying Eldred by later giving him to the Fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].\n\n===Battles with Earth's heroes===\nLoki's schemes eventually came to include [[Earth]] itself, and often fought with Earth's superhuman heroes to take their planet, and often Asgard itself.

Several times Loki, while not directly battling Thor, caused other threats for Thor to battle, like increasing the mental powers of a carnival fortune teller Sandu, making him powerful enough to lift buildings with his mind,<ref name=\"jim91\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 91 (Apr. 1963)</ref> and releasing a [[Lava Men|Lava Man]] called Molto by accident when causing a long-dead volcano to explode.<ref name=\"jim97\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 97 (Oct. 1963)</ref> When Loki convinced Odin to punish Thor, Odin took away half of Thor's power, after which Loki returned the memory of the 23rd-century villain [[Zarrko]].

Loki went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in an attempt to attain freedom, but all his efforts failed. Upon convincing Odin to go to Earth and leave him in charge of Asgard with part of the Odinforce, he released Skagg, the largest Storm Giant, and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], the largest Fire Demon, to try to destroy Odin. However, Thor and Balder helped defeat the monsters, and Loki was sent to serve the Trolls. Loki was responsible for the Destroyer being awakened, by leading a Hunter to the Temple where the Destroyer armor resided using their mental abilities while Thor was nearby, causing the soul of the Hunter to animate the armor, but Thor forced the Hunter to return to his body, then buried the armor under thousands of tons of rock.<ref name=\"jim118119\">''Journey into Mystery'' #118\u2013119 (July - Aug. 1965)</ref> The Absorbing Man was brought back to Earth by Loki, and battled Thor, but Loki quickly took him to Asgard when Thor was on the verge of defeating them. The Absorbing Man defeated the Asgardians without too much trouble and absorbed Odin's attacks.

Loki plotted to gain new powers from [[Karnilla]]; however, this accidentally created the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], who gained Asgardian powers upon being mistaken for Loki after knocking him out and putting on his helmet just before Karnilla appeared in response to Loki's ritual. He almost killed Thor by collapsing a building on him, as Thor had been stripped of all his powers except his strength by Odin.

At this time, Loki's estranged wife [[Sigyn (Marvel Comics)|Sigyn]] returned to Asgard. When Loki was chained and a viper dripped poison on his face as punishment for killing Balder, Sigyn tried helping him.

This was because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard, whereas Loki sought only to rule it. Alongside Odin and Thor, Loki battled Surtur, and witnessed the seeming demise of Odin.<ref name=\"thor353\">''Thor'' No. 353 (Mar. 1985)</ref> Not long after that, Loki transformed Thor into a frog for a time, using the Twilight Sword.

They possess physical attributes equal to a fit member of his race, such as enhanced strength, stamina (their Frost Giant metabolism grants them superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities), speed, durability enough to withstand high-caliber bullets without harm, and immunity to all known diseases and toxins, as well as resistance to magic and aging.\n\nLoki possesses genius-level intelligence and has extensive training in magic, and possesses the ability to manipulate magical forces for a variety of purposes: energy projection, creation of [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]], temporarily increasing their own physical capabilities, granting superhuman abilities to living beings or inanimate objects, flight, [[hypnosis]], illusion casting and inter-dimensional [[teleportation]].\n\nLoki's magical abilities have been described as equal to those of [[Karnilla]], the most skilled sorceress of Asgard.<ref name=\"nmse1\">''New Mutants Special Edition'' No. 1 (Dec. 1985)</ref><ref name=\"xa9\">''X-Men Annual'' No. 9 (Dec. 1985)</ref> His illusion casting can fool cities,<ref name=\"jim96\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 96 (Sept. 1963)</ref> and powerful entities such as Surtur.<ref>''Thor'' #352\u2013353</ref> He has been able to break free of Celestial technology in the possession of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref name=\"xfv150\">''X-Factor'' vol 1, No. 50 (Jan. 1990)</ref>\n\nLoki possesses extrasensory abilities and is capable of [[astral projection]] and casting their thoughts across great distances\u2014even across dimensional barriers, like that between Asgard and Earth\u2014even if they are unable to move. They cannot read the minds of other beings, although they can influence their actions, and once briefly hypnotized Thor, as well as controlling a flock of birds. However, they could not coerce Thor to give him Mjolnir.<ref name=\"jim85\"/> If someone has evil thoughts, Loki can influence their actions (even if they are in Asgard and the subject is on Earth),<ref name=\"jim118119\"/> and can influence other events to a degree, such as driving a missile from its path,<ref name=\"jim94\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 94 (July 1963)</ref> or redirecting a radio signal.<ref>''Avengers'' vol 1 #1</ref>\n\nLoki is an adept [[shapeshifter]] and can change into animals (examples include [[transmogrification]] to a salmon, horse, etc.) or impersonate other people, such as Thor or [[Captain America]]. However, he does not necessarily gain the abilities of whatever or whoever he turns into, although minor natural abilities such as flight in bird form tend to work. Loki may mimic the abilities of some supernatural beings if they turn into such creatures. They have also turned clouds into dragons, and animated trees to attack Thor.<ref name=\"jim92\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 92 (May 1963)</ref> After their rebirth, their shapeshifting abilities are more limited.

Finally winning the throne after a long-sought out fight is not as sweet as they thought it would be. The ones that helped them now demand their due and the favors they promised them, including the death goddess Hela and seductress [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 No. 1 (August 2004)</ref> While they go about their kingdom, they continually turn to their prisoners, Thor and Sif. Sif berates Loki for being jealous of her, and of cutting off her golden hair, only to bring about a greater love between her and Thor. While Balder reminds them that they have died and gone to Hel, while there, sees that there are parallel dimension incarnations of Thor, Loki, and Balder: Some different, yet all play the same roles. And Loki's role is never to rule. Loki then turns to Karnilla, and agrees to free Balder into her care, in exchange for her to peer into a myriad other dimensions.<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 #2 (September 2004)</ref> There they see confirmation of Balder's words, all with Thor triumphant. Loki decides that Thor will indeed die at dawn by beheading. As they're walking out of the dungeons, they run into [[F\u00e1rbauti]], their birth father.<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 No. 3 (October 2004)</ref> Loki decides to go against fate, and spare their brother as well as free him, while Hela is revealed to be a failed illusion cast by another Loki to convince them to kill their brother.

They go searching for their brother and finds him frozen in a block of ice in Norway, where he has just been discovered by archeologist Dr. Donald Blake. Loki attempts to destroy Thor then and there and finds that their magics are unable to do so. To their surprise, they found that they had been reborn in this reality and recently grouped together. Blake showed the Avengers the frozen Thor and after they work together to free him from the ice, Loki tricked the confused Thor into battling the Avengers. Thor eventually realized his sibling's deception and watched as the Scarlet Witch banished Loki into limbo. They offered Thor a spot on the team and he accepted.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 2 No. 1 (Nov 1996)</ref>\n\nRealizing this universe had no Asgard, and as such no Odin, Loki decided a larger revenge scheme was in order, and sought out Enchantress to help them in this end. They sought to take control of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and make her their pawn. In doing so, they incapacitated her teacher [[Agatha Harkness]], trapping her essence in a tree and had the Enchantress pose as her. The Enchantress then put the Scarlet Witch under her spell. Loki meanwhile tricked the Hulk into attacking Avengers Island, causing a breach in the gamma core there; however, an assemblage of the Avengers and [[Fantastic Four]] prevented any disaster from happening.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 2 #4\u20136 (Feb. \u2013 Apr. 1997)</ref>\n\nRealizing the foes that some people on this world had a unique energy that Loki could absorb (thereby absorbing their bodies), they sought out these beings and absorbed their power. While keeping the Avengers busy they absorbed the forms of [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], [[Baron Zemo]], [[MODOK]], Executioner, [[Wonder Man]] and others; they also tricked the Avengers [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] to join their ranks, transferring Hellcat's essence into Scarlet Witch's body. Thor soon grew tired of the Avengers' morality on killing their foes and left the group, becoming easy prey for the Enchantress to enthrall them to joining Loki's side.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 2 #8\u20139 (June\u2013July 1997)</ref>\n\nLoki soon learned that the source of the power they were absorbing came from the gamma core on Avengers Island, which was a rift in time and space that was seemingly creating villains for the Avengers to fight. They sent their minions to attack the remaining Avengers (now teamed with the true Thor of Earth-616) while they absorbed this power. When Loki absorbed the power from the gamma core, they were given untold power and grew to gigantic proportions. When Thor and Enchantress attempted to join them, they betrayed them. Realizing this betrayal, Hawkeye, Thor, Enchantress and Hellcat go over to the heroes side and Enchantress, Agatha Harkness and Scarlet Witch pool their magical powers to turn one of the Thor's into a giant replica of Odin to battle Loki while the other Avengers work to build a device that will reverse Loki's newly obtained powers. Captain America goes toe-to-toe against Loki buying the others enough time to hit Loki with their power reversal cannon and allowing Thor to strike them with his hammer. The resulting combination causes Loki to suddenly disburse into the energy that they absorbed, seemingly destroying them and ending their threat.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 No. 11 (Sept 1997)</ref>\n\n===Earth X===\n[[File:Loki Laufeyson (Earth X).jpg|thumb|upright|Loki in alternate universe Earth X. Art by [[Matt Hollingsworth]]]]\nIn the reality of [[Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman, saying he needed to learn humility in the form of a female. They later cast a spell on the Bifrost that if Thor would return to Asgard, Loki would get free rein on Earth.<ref>''Earth X'' Vol 1 No. 5 (Aug 1999)</ref> In this reality, Loki figured out that Asgardians aren't actually gods, but are instead long-lived mutants of incredible power who are mentally mind-locked by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] into believing that they are immortal, never-changing gods so that they won't evolve further as mutants and potentially become a threat to their plans for Earth in the future. They first tell Odin and the others of their true origin and they refuse to believe them. In order to make them see the truth, they stab themselves in the heart and is cast into Hela's realm of the dead. They then convince them to oppose the Celestials' attack on Earth, but when fighting the Celestials, they make the Asgardians think that they are nothing and already dead, all except Loki.<ref>''Earth X'' Vol 1 #X (June 2000)</ref>\n\nYears later, Odin sent Thor to Earth as a champion to battle Loki, but Loki convinced Thor of Odin's manipulation over the Asgardians and the two team up to battle him.<ref>''Universe X'' Vol 1 No. 4 (Jan 2001)</ref> After Odin was defeated and Earth was safe, Thor reverted to his form of Donald Blake and Loki transformed themselves into a new Thor, and, with [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Black Bolt]], they became a new incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''Paradise X'' No. 4 (Sept 2002)</ref>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\nIn the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] timeline (Earth-691), Loki is alive and well in the 31st Century, living on the moon. They lead an attack on Asgard with their squad of Inhuman Assassins for Composite's sonic diffusion muzzle when they are stopped by Woden Thorson, their nephew.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' No. 42 (Nov 1993)</ref> With the help of [[Talon (Marvel Comics)|Talon]] and [[Aleta Ogord|Aleta]], they imprison Loki.

Seeking to take advantage of this, a corporation called \"Alchemax\" decided to create their own Valhalla. One of the company's scientists, Jordan Boone, decided that he wanted to have powers and snuck into the program where he became Loki but still maintained their own personality. Boone (Loki) helps [[Doom 2099|Doom]], [[Krystalin]], [[Bloodhawk]], [[Skullfire|Timothy Fitzgerald]] and [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] fight Alchemax's versions of Thor and Heimdall. After Heimdall is defeated, Loki watches as Doom defeats Thor, gloating about their plan to pit Alchemax and heroes against each other to gain enough superpower to shapeshift out of it. They transform into a bird and flies away.<ref>''X-Men 2099'' Vol 1 No. 5 (Feb 1994)</ref>\n\nWhen Loki is next seen, they appear as the villainous Halloween Jack after being tortured by Desdemona and her brother, Lytton, after they accuse them of cheating in their casino. Loki seeks revenge on them for turning them \"into a monster\" and with the help of Meanstreak, they head to Las Vegas and find Desdemona alone in her office. They attack her, revealing to her their true form (Loki) and hacks into her accounts and plans to make Vegas fun again.<ref>''X-Men 2099'' Vol 1 No. 17 (Feb 1995)</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the alternate ''[[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, Loki is shown dead, having been killed and eaten by the Zombie Avengers.<ref name=\"mzr1\">''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'' Vol 1.

They tie them up and takes them to Asgard, where they want to use Thunderstrike's mace's powers for themselves, but Kevin disrupts the spell, absorbing the mace into himself and transforming into a new Thunderstrike in the process. Loki and their army of Trolls are defeated by the heroes, with help from Thor, now the King of Asgard, and Loki and their army retreated. Thunderstrike, Stinger, J2 and Mainframe decide to stay together as the new Avengers. The adult heroes decline to stay with the reformed team because of personal reasons.<ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1 No. 1 (Oct 1998)</ref>\n\nYears later, Loki is bitter about the fact that they were the cause of the Avengers' formation and wants to get their revenge. They start kidnapping heroes, holding them prisoner in life-sized crystals when [[Captain America]], J2, Thunderstrike, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]] show up through a portal they found in another universe. The heroes are quickly outnumbered by Loki's robots and they vow to end ''The Age of Heroes''.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' Vol. 1 No. 2 (Sept 2005)</ref>\n\nJ2 and Spider-Girl escape but Captain America and Thunderstrike are chained and Loki plans to brainwash the heroes to send them back to Earth where they will become violent and turn against each so they will eventually destroy all the heroes. Their plan is ruined by Thor when they shows up after figuring out why certain superheroes are acting so much differently. Together, Thor, Captain America, Hulk and Spider-Girl get Loki to surrender. Captain America notices a gem hanging on Loki's neck, and smashes it with his shield. Loki was using this gem to help turn the heroes evil but once the gem is destroyed, the heroes revert to normal. A furious Loki releases a deadly blast on Captain America, killing him. Thor uses his hammer and sends Loki into Limbo forever and the Hulk decides to join them to make sure that Loki remains there. After Captain America dies, Thor uses his hammer to grant Captain America's soul immortality. His soul floats into the skies, and creates a shiny new, bright star in the sky in the form of Captain America's shield, meant to always inspire the heroes and future generations to come.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' Vol. 1 #2\u20133 (Oct - Nov 2005)</ref>\n\nIn this universe, Loki has a daughter, Sylene.

Art by [[Greg Land]]]]\nLoki appears in ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'' as the evil half-sibling of [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]].<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #1\">''Ultimates 2'' #1</ref>\nThe Ultimate version of Loki has the ability to \"shuffle time and space\", and in their first appearance, causes a ripple during Thor's conversation with [[Volstagg]]. In the restaurant, Loki is apparently in the background, which would mark their first \"appearance\" (he is mentioned and his powers apparently used, but they are only briefly seen).<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #1\"/> Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room Without Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the [[United States]] after assisting the [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]] (multinational group of superpowered villains representing [[Syria]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Russia]], [[North Korea]], and [[France]]). Through their power they create the persona for themselves of \"'''Gunnar Golmen'''\", the head scientist of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] extension of the \"European Defense Initiative\", the European counterpart to The Ultimates, and turns Thor into \"Thorlief\", Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #4</ref>\n\nLater in the story, they confront the captive Thor and gloats that it is all just another one of their games, and informs him that there is a traitor in the ranks of the Ultimates. When Thor requests assistance from the guards, Loki is nowhere to be seen, though they appears as a snake around Thor's neck after they leave (most likely a nod to the real Loki in Norse mythology).<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #6</ref> At the end of ''Ultimates 2'' No. 9, Loki states that the reason they joined the Liberators was because \"They had a Norse god on their side. It's only fair you should get one too\", and that \"Odin sent his son to bring the world peace. I couldn't resist the opportunity to mess that up.\"<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #9</ref> However, they are hesitant to use their abilities overtly as they claim Odin will then be able to find them. Yet once all The Liberators are defeated, they decide to do things themselves. After revealing to the Ultimates who they truly are, they rise into the air and change the color of the sky. At that moment\u2014thanks to the Scarlet Witch 'calculating the odds' of someone showing up to defeat them\u2014the sky opens and Thor, his brother, appears for revenge.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #12</ref>\n\nIssue 13 shows further demonstrations of their power by attempting to trap Thor in an illusion and withstanding a direct blow from Thor's hammer uninjured, claiming it cannot hurt them. During this battle, Thor mentions that Loki's powers have weakened for an unexplained reason. After Loki summons an army of monsters to battle the Ultimates and nearly kills Thor, the thunder god then proceeds to summon allies from Asgard while he strikes Loki with his hammer, sending them back to Asgard where Odin awaits.<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #13\">''Ultimates 2'' #13</ref>\n\nLoki's motivation for their actions is not completely revealed. They mention several motivations, from a desire to cause World War III to Odin favoring Thor over them and attempting to gain Odin's favor.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #8</ref> Throughout the whole ordeal, Loki regards humans as mere playthings for their pranks. In addition to creating a Norwegian super-soldier program that was supposedly part of an EU initiative and making people believe it was real, even though Norway is not part of the [[European Union]], they claimed to have been the one who framed [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] for treason and murdering [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'s family, regarding the failure of humans to realize the problems with these assertions as humorous.<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #13\"/>\n\nLoki is freed from their \"punishment\" in ''[[New Ultimates]]'',<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1</ref> playing an integral part in the re-appearance of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], now super-powered, as well the invasion of trolls to [[New York City|New York]] with the help of [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]].<ref name=\"New Ultimates #2\">''New Ultimates'' #2</ref> They are later revealed to be the one behind [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]'s powers manifesting after the invasion forces attacked America.<ref name=\"New Ultimates #2\"/> In revenge against Thor, Loki impales Valkyrie with a sword, to which she is restored by [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] as a real Valkyrie and takes vengeance on Loki, banishing them to [[Hel (location)|Hel]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'' #5</ref> Loki and every other Asgardian, excluding Thor were killed by the Children of Tomorrow (led by [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Marvel|Reed Richards]]) when Asgard was destroyed.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #2</ref>\n\n''[[Ultimate Comics: Thor]]'' elaborates Loki's backstory. Loki is the child of Odin and the giantess Laufey, who procreated them as part of a peace settlement between Asgard and Jotunheim. Loki was always jealous of their older brother Thor for having been given Mjolnir and rebelled against Asgard by stealing the sacred Norn Stones (relic extensions of Odin's power) and killing their half-brother Balder with their favoured bow. Banished from Asgard, Loki (going under the disguise of Nazi supervillain [[Baron Zemo]]) waged an attack on the kingdom eons later, in 1939, with a coalition army of Frost Giants and Nazi soldiers, killing every Asgardian in sight. Loki attempted a battle with Odin, only to be forced into the Room Without Doors while Asgard was destroyed. Using the Stones, Loki is later summoned by an older Nazi, [[Helmut Zemo]] (around the time The Hulk was fighting the Ultimates in [[Manhattan]] during Ultimates vol. 1). For his loyalty, Loki kills him.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Thor'' #4</ref>\n\n===Goddess of Thunder===\nReality on Earth-1026, Thor has met and fallen in love with [[Ororo Munroe]] from the [[X-Men]]. Loki casts a spell on [[Tarene]], who is insanely jealous of Ororo because she too has feelings for Thor. Maddened by Loki's spell, Tarene goes after Ororo and is killed by Thor when he steps in to protect her. With Tarene's death, her hammer goes to Ororo, making her Goddess of Thunder.<ref>''X-Men: Millennial Visions'' Vol 1 #2 (January 2002)</ref>\n\n===Earth 3515===\n[[File:Loki Amazing Spider-Man 795.png|thumb|Loki wears [[Doctor Strange]]'s Cloak of Levitation and [[Eye of Agamotto]] (April 2018).

After not being able to take it anymore, they stabbed Thor, and proceeded to destroy the Earth, killing everyone on it. King Thor comes to seek revenge, but King Loki raises the undead Avengers to attack him. Knowing they cannot defeat their brother, King Loki retreats to the past, where they plan to kill the Odinson while he cannot wield Mjolnir.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #12\"/> This future was ultimately avoided when the present Loki changes their fate, but King Loki is still at large.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #13\"/>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, King Loki devises a plan that involves traveling to Hel to free a monster that will destroy Asgard. The Asgardians later gather to witness King Loki on the back of the Midgard Serpent where they believe that this will be their end.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #14\"/> However, the real Loki appears and wards them off, just as the universe ends. As Loki is now the God of Stories though, he saves a memory of the universe in the form of a story. After everything in existence is gone, Loki confronts a crying King Loki. As Loki would not be here without them, they embrace their no-longer future self. King Loki disappears, and Loki and their friend Verity await to see what the universe's next story will bring.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #17\"/>\n\nAfter the timeline is restored, it was revealed that Loki was seeking All-Black the Necrosword, the first [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]].

In the episode \"Thor the Mighty\", they manipulate a Frost Giants group into attacking [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] while [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is on Earth. Following the Frost Giants' defeat by Thor, Loki ends up fighting their brother but is defeated and banished by [[Odin (character)|Odin]] to the Isle of Silence where they are unable to use their magic/trickery. After [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] frees them, Loki is implied to be the [[Masters of Evil]]'s shadowy benefactor seen at the end of \"Masters of Evil\". In season one's three-part season finale (\"This Hostage Earth\", \"The Fall of Asgard\" and \"A Day Unlike Any Other\"), Loki returns having conquered Asgard as well as eight of the nine realms by corrupting the Tree of Life. Loki attempts to invade Earth by having the Masters of Evil steal the Norn Stones from the sorceress [[Karnilla]] in order to transport his forces to Midgard and effortlessly conquer the planet. However, their plan fails, as the Avengers manage to destroy the stones and transport themselves to each of the eight mythical realms. When Thor is captured, Loki reveals being behind everything from his brother's exile to the Avengers' creation with the super-villain prison breakout and the Masters of Evil, with Loki admitting that both their initial attack on Asgard and their own exile (back in \"Thor the Mighty\") was simply a diversion so that they would not be perceived as a threat while on Earth. Eventually, Loki engages the Avengers and numerous Asgardian warriors in a final showdown to stop the God of Mischief from conquering the nine realms. Although they destroy [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and fights [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armor|Asgardian-buster armor]] to a standstill, Loki is stopped when [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]] pulls out the Tree of Life, in which a new tree regrows and disconnects Loki from the Odinforce. It also allows Odin to regain consciousness and banish Loki again. Despite their defeat, Loki pledges that they will never stop trying to conquer Asgard and will suffer a thousand times worse. Loki is then shown in a swamp-like realm where they are tortured by the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] dripping poison into their eyes while Loki screams hysterically at their endless torment.\n* Loki appears in the [[Disney XD]]-produced Marvel cartoons,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=815|title=Marvel Animation Age - The Marvel Animation News Resource|work=toonzone.net|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}</ref> voiced by [[Troy Baker]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Doomstroyer|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=10|airdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref> \n** In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, Loki has dealing with [[Spider-Man]].

Loki later tries to get their vengeance on Spider-Man in the episode \"Run Pig Run\" where they turn Spider-Man into a [[Spider-Ham|pig]] to be hunted by the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] and the episode \"Itsy Bitsy Spider-Man\" where they disguise themselves as a weird kid (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Itsy Bitsy Spider-Man|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=12|airdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref>) that torments the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]] and uses the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] but is foiled both times by the wall-crawler, Thor and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees. Loki has a supporting role in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors''. In the two-part \"Avenging Spider-Man\", Loki partners with [[Doctor Octopus]] to take revenge on Spider-Man and the Avengers. After switching bodies with their shared nemesis, Loki [as Spider-Man] (voiced by [[Drake Bell]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Avenging Spider-Man, Part 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=1|airdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref>) leads various creatures from various realms that were experimented on with the mass-produced [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote thanks to Doc Ock before switching bodies back with Spider-Man. After the rampaging Venom creatures are defeated by the Avengers and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees and sent the creatures back their respective realms, Loki is cast out of Earth and then attacked by a number of vengeful creatures.\n** In the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, Loki appears as an occasional antagonist to the Avengers, specifically Thor. In the episode \"The Doomstroyer\", they work with the Avengers to stop the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] that was hijacked by [[Doctor Doom]]. With Loki's help, Thor, Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] trace Doctor Doom to Helheim with the Helhorn as the Destroyer's controller while guarded by the Midgard Serpent. After Iron Man gets Doctor Doom to deactivate the Destroyer and Captain America removes the Helhorn from Doctor Doom then is evacuated from Helheim and returned to Latveria, Loki tries to take control of the Destroyer but is stopped by the Avengers. In the episode \"Valhalla Can Wait\", Loki manipulates a confrontation between Thor and the [[Hulk]] while impersonating ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Megan McLaren]] (voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Valhalla Can Wait|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=3|airdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>). With Thor and Hulk in Valhalla, they makes a deal with [[Hela (comics)|Hela]]; Loki borrows the Horn of Hela to control the skeleton minions while Hela's entertained with Hulk and Thor fighting each other. After having a giant skeleton rampage around, Loki later fights with Thor and Hulk where the two Avengers take a dive against him. Hela, now having realized Loki's plans, deems Loki the winner of the fight and takes Loki back to Valhalla for entertainment. In the episode \"Back to the Learning Hall\", Loki uses the [[Infinity Gems|Space Stone]] to make Asgard crash into Earth. At the same time, they have Thor come to Asgard in order to mess with their brother once again while also using the Space Stone to escape Valhalla. However, Thor overcomes the mind games and defeats Loki, resulting in their incarceration in Asgard. In the episode \"Spectrums\", a spectral replica of Loki appears as a manifestation of Thor's nightmares thanks to [[Doctor Spectrum]], with the manifestation based on Thor's belief that Loki's villainous tendencies are the result of Thor's neglect to protect Loki. Thor eventually overcomes the illusion by acknowledging the failure and remaining hopeful Loki will change. Loki has a minor appearance in ''Avengers: Ultron Revolution'', remaining incarcerated in Asgard's dungeons. Loki has a central appearance in ''Avengers: Secret Wars'', using the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] and the Casket of Ancient Winters to take control of Earth while the Avengers and [[The New Avengers (comics)|the New Avengers]] were unavailable.

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]] and penciller [[Jack Kirby]], a version of the character first appeared in ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' #6 (August 1949). The modern-day incarnation of Loki first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #85 (October 1962). The character, which is based on the [[Loki|Norse deity of the same name]], is the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god of mischief and adopted child of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and sibling of the [[superhero]]es [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], themselves shown as both a [[supervillain]] and [[antihero]]. The character is [[genderfluid]], having been depicted as both [[male]] and [[female]].\n\nLoki has appeared in several ongoing series, [[limited series]] and alternate reality series, including the 4-issue series ''Loki'' in 2004 and 2006, being the main character of ''Journey into Mystery'' from issues 622 to 645, appearing in new issues of ''[[Young Avengers]]'' in 2013 and receiving two more solo series, ''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' in 2013 and ''Vote Loki'' in 2016. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, movies, video games, clothing, and toys.\n\nIn 2009, Loki was ranked as [[IGN]]'s eighth-greatest comic book villain of all time<ref>{{cite web|title=Loki is number 8|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/8.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=5 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202141413/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/8.html|archivedate=December 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and in 2014 was ranked again by IGN, this time as the fourth-greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/4.html Loki is number 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202141244/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/4.html |date=December 2, 2012 }}, [[IGN]].</ref> [[Tom Hiddleston]] portrays the [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013), ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).

Described this precise way in secondary sources, or is it just a cute bit of trivia that some Timely Comics share continuity with later Marvel works, and both happened to feature characters named for Odin's adopted sibling, that some Wikipedian decided was worth mentioning? Because the latter is the definition of OR. Also: \"the traditional image of the Devil\"!?|date=June 2018}} Planning to spread hate, he convinced [[Jupiter]] to let him into the realm Earth, using Venus already being allowed onto it as his justification. Venus pledged herself to Loki's service in order to stop his plans, with Jupiter seeing her unselfish act and freeing her from the pledge, with Loki subsequently being sent back to the Underworld. The modern-age Loki made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nAs one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki has frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> As well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series, he was the starring character in two four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Loki'' in 2004 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mayerson, Ginger |author2=Poonsombat, Nirut |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |title=Interview: Esad Ribi\u0107 |publisher=The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society Miscellanea and Ephemeron |date=November 9, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502034356/http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27138 |title=Aguirre-Sacasa Gets Mischievous With \"Loki\" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |title=AGUIRRE-SACASA Details LOKI's Origin in October |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716173604/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |archive-date=July 16, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLoki played a key role in the 2010s company-wide ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, in which the character is eventually killed.\n\nStarting with issue No. 622 the ongoing series ''Thor'' reverted to the original title ''Journey into Mystery'' and shifted focus to Loki.

The sorcerer caught him unaware, turning Bor into snow. Bor's son, [[Odin (character)|Odin]], found his father as he was blowing away; Bor begged Odin to find a sorcerer to free him, but Odin made no attempt to save his father. Bor cursed Odin saying that he would take in the son of a fallen king and raise it as his own. Not a week later, Odin himself led the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] into battle against the Frost Giants and killed [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], who was the King, in personal combat. After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants. The child was Loki; Laufey having kept him hidden from the Frost Giant people due to his shame over his sons small size. Odin took the child, out of a combination of pity, to appease the memory of his father, and because he was the child of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised as his own alongside his biological son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol 3 #7\u20138 (May, June 2008)</ref>\n\nThroughout his childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences between how Thor and himself were treated by the citizens of Asgard.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Studios Visual Dictionary|last=Bray|first=Adam|publisher=Marvel|year=2018|isbn=9781465476371|location=New York, New York|pages=70}}</ref> The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things, and Loki was clearly inferior to his brother Thor in those areas. What he lacked in size and strength, however, he made up for in power and skill, particularly as a [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcerer]]. As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest and earned him a nickname as the \"God of Mischief\"; his mischievousness eventually became malice as his hunger for power and revenge grew stronger. Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor, such as telling him to guard a hole in the wall that he himself had made. In time, his reputation grew from being a playful and mischievous [[trickster]] to the \"God of [[Evil]]\". Over the centuries, Loki attempted on many occasions to seize the rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor, even helping the Storm Giant Ghan to escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later, and aided other enemies of Asgard, planning to take over. Odin, who had grown weary of Loki's mischief, magically imprisoned him within a tree until someone would shed a tear for his plight. Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], the guardian of [[Bifrost]], in the eye, which made him shed a tear. Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in Asgard, and was frequently exiled.<ref>[[Matt Fraction]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), ''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' #1 (April 30, 2008), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> He later met the Sorcerer Eldred, who taught him [[black magic]], repaying Eldred by later giving him to the Fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].\n\n===Battles with Earth's heroes===\nLoki's schemes eventually came to include [[Earth]] itself, and often fought with Earth's superhuman heroes to take their planet, and often Asgard itself. He first battled Thor on Earth in modern times after escaping from the tree;<ref name=\"jim85\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 85 (Oct. 1962)</ref> Loki then manipulated the [[Hulk]] into wreaking havoc using an illusion of dynamite on train tracks, while in astral form in an attempt to lure Thor to Earth, which inadvertently led to the formation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as several other heroes came to meet the Hulk.<ref name=\"avengers1\">''Avengers'' No. 1 (Sept. 1963)</ref>\n\nThor was one of the founding members of this superhuman team, and often led them into battle against Loki. Several times Loki, while not directly battling Thor, caused other threats for Thor to battle, like increasing the mental powers of a carnival fortune teller Sandu, making him powerful enough to lift buildings with his mind,<ref name=\"jim91\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 91 (Apr. 1963)</ref> and releasing a [[Lava Men|Lava Man]] called Molto by accident when causing a long-dead volcano to explode.<ref name=\"jim97\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 97 (Oct. 1963)</ref> When Loki convinced Odin to punish Thor, Odin took away half of Thor's power, after which Loki returned the memory of the 23rd-century villain [[Zarrko]].

Loki went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in an attempt to attain freedom, but all his efforts failed. Upon convincing Odin to go to Earth and leave him in charge of Asgard with part of the Odinforce, he released Skagg, the largest Storm Giant, and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], the largest Fire Demon, to try to destroy Odin. However, Thor and Balder helped defeat the monsters, and Loki was sent to serve the Trolls. Loki was responsible for the Destroyer being awakened, by leading a Hunter to the Temple where the Destroyer armor resided using their mental abilities while Thor was nearby, causing the soul of the Hunter to animate the armor, but Thor forced the Hunter to return to his body, then buried the armor under thousands of tons of rock.<ref name=\"jim118119\">''Journey into Mystery'' #118\u2013119 (July - Aug. 1965)</ref> The Absorbing Man was brought back to Earth by Loki, and battled Thor, but Loki quickly took him to Asgard when Thor was on the verge of defeating them. The Absorbing Man defeated the Asgardians without too much trouble and absorbed Odin's attacks. However Loki and the Absorbing Man were exiled into space due to a trick by Odin,<ref name=\"jim121123\">''Journey into Mystery'' #121\u2013123 (Oct. \u2013 Dec. 1965)</ref> then sending his astral form back to Earth and taking over the Destroyer armor, attempting to take over Asgard; Odin then sent Balder to discover the location of Loki, then using his powers to send Loki out of the Destroyer armor.<ref name=\"thora2\">''Thor Annual'' No. 2 (Sept. 1966)</ref>\n\n===Taking over Asgard===\nLoki's destiny to be the cause of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] was later recounted.<ref name=\"thor127\">''Thor'' No. 127 (Apr. 1966)</ref> Loki returned from exile in space, but was then stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth by Odin.

By moving the time-table up by only a few years, King Loki could kill Thor while still one day successfully destroying the Earth.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #12\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #12''</ref>\n\nLoki then goes into a metaphorical space, where Old Loki and Kid Loki are, telling them that they will not be able to change their story. Verity then calls them out, telling Loki that because King Loki didn't recognize her, an alternate future is already unfolding. Loki now decides to change their destiny, realizing that lies are just stories, and as god of them, they can tell a new one. They then seemingly destroy themselves, sending King Loki to the now changed near-future. Eight months pass, and the sky turns red as the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]] is about to begin, when Verity hears a knock on her door, with Loki standing there, claiming to be the \"God(dess) of Stories\".<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #13\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #13</ref>\n\n[[File:LokiReborn.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Loki reborn. Art by [[Lee Garbett]]]]\n\n====Secret Wars====\nThe \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline picks up directly after the prior events with Verity being unsure if she can trust Loki now that they are a different person. Loki tells Verity that she is important in this end of the world event. Meanwhile, King Loki has set the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] free, and plans on using it to destroy Asgard.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #14\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #14</ref> As King Loki wages war on Asgard, killing gods and cracking jokes, the younger Loki places Verity Willis's soul in a pretty glowing bracelet to protect her from being annihilated along with her physical form when the Multiverse comes to an end. Just as it seems certain that King Loki will defeat the Asgardians, Freyja sacrificed her life to destroy Jormungandr and Odin blows the fabled Gjallarhorn (the Horn of Heroes) to resurrect the dead gods, as foretold, for their final battle. To King Loki's astonishment, Loki is alive and turns up to join the legion of deceased gods in Asgard's defence. Upon being faced with Loki and all the resurrected gods, King Loki loses their nerve and flees into the ether.<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #15</ref> Loki is hailed by all as a hero. This is exactly what all previous iterations of Loki would have wanted most: attention, adoration, praise. Odin even proudly compares Loki to Thor and calls him \"son\", but Loki shakes off Odin's promises insisting that he's done taking \"sides\". Loki and Verity then survive the incursion,<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #16</ref> and chase away the gods who sit above the Multiverse, who want Loki to surrender the stories of Asgard, which he is keeping in preservation. They also discover King Loki, another survivor of the incursions, and upon explaining that they understand King Loki's motivations. King Loki breaks down in tears, and Loki places their alternate self in their sceptre as a reminder of their potential to commit great evil. Loki then explains that the universe will be reborn, and invites Verity to follow them into a new reality by creating a door labelled 'Next', although they are unsure as to whether they will change again on the other side.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #17\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #17</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLoki is a member of the race of Frost Giants of [[Jotunheim]], although not a giant in stature. They possess physical attributes equal to a fit member of his race, such as enhanced strength, stamina (their Frost Giant metabolism grants them superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities), speed, durability enough to withstand high-caliber bullets without harm, and immunity to all known diseases and toxins, as well as resistance to magic and aging.\n\nLoki possesses genius-level intelligence and has extensive training in magic, and possesses the ability to manipulate magical forces for a variety of purposes: energy projection, creation of [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]], temporarily increasing their own physical capabilities, granting superhuman abilities to living beings or inanimate objects, flight, [[hypnosis]], illusion casting and inter-dimensional [[teleportation]].\n\nLoki's magical abilities have been described as equal to those of [[Karnilla]], the most skilled sorceress of Asgard.<ref name=\"nmse1\">''New Mutants Special Edition'' No. 1 (Dec. 1985)</ref><ref name=\"xa9\">''X-Men Annual'' No. 9 (Dec. 1985)</ref> His illusion casting can fool cities,<ref name=\"jim96\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 96 (Sept. 1963)</ref> and powerful entities such as Surtur.<ref>''Thor'' #352\u2013353</ref> He has been able to break free of Celestial technology in the possession of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref name=\"xfv150\">''X-Factor'' vol 1, No. 50 (Jan. 1990)</ref>\n\nLoki possesses extrasensory abilities and is capable of [[astral projection]] and casting their thoughts across great distances\u2014even across dimensional barriers, like that between Asgard and Earth\u2014even if they are unable to move. They cannot read the minds of other beings, although they can influence their actions, and once briefly hypnotized Thor, as well as controlling a flock of birds. However, they could not coerce Thor to give him Mjolnir.<ref name=\"jim85\"/> If someone has evil thoughts, Loki can influence their actions (even if they are in Asgard and the subject is on Earth),<ref name=\"jim118119\"/> and can influence other events to a degree, such as driving a missile from its path,<ref name=\"jim94\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 94 (July 1963)</ref> or redirecting a radio signal.<ref>''Avengers'' vol 1 #1</ref>\n\nLoki is an adept [[shapeshifter]] and can change into animals (examples include [[transmogrification]] to a salmon, horse, etc.) or impersonate other people, such as Thor or [[Captain America]]. However, he does not necessarily gain the abilities of whatever or whoever he turns into, although minor natural abilities such as flight in bird form tend to work. Loki may mimic the abilities of some supernatural beings if they turn into such creatures. They have also turned clouds into dragons, and animated trees to attack Thor.<ref name=\"jim92\">''Journey into Mystery'' No. 92 (May 1963)</ref> After their rebirth, their shapeshifting abilities are more limited. He explain to [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]] that, \"I can turn into anything, as long as it's me\", which they demonstrate by transforming into the female Lady Loki and a lupine form.<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #5 (2014)</ref>\n\nLoki imbued himself with magical abilities that enables them to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian, such as being beheaded by Balder. They have also been shown to be immune to the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]]'s control disk,<ref>''Captain America'' Vol 1 No. 366 (Jan 1990)</ref> the mental influence of the Voice, and the power-sapping abilities of [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' Vol 1 No. 2 (Jan 1986)</ref>\n\nLoki crafted a method of cheating death, being reincarnated upon any \"death\" of their body now that they has arranged with the various incarnations of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] that their name be erased from the books of Hel.<ref name=\"Siege 2010\"/><ref name=\"Callahan user_review&id=2108\"/>\n\nLoki possesses a brilliant intellect, with some knowledge of technology, as when they created a machine to amplify Iceman's powers,<ref>''Thor'' #378</ref> and when they attached devices to the Twilight sword to tap into its powers.<ref>''Thor'' #363</ref> They are an expert manipulator and schemer, frequently using pawns in their plans. They are sometimes armed with a sword, a whip, or a three-pronged spear and have used magical items (such as the Norn Stones{{issue|date=December 2013}}) to enhance their powers.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Loki Triumphant===\nA 4-issue series simply titled ''Loki'', where Loki has now claimed leadership of Asgard, and all must recognize that fact, even Thor. Finally winning the throne after a long-sought out fight is not as sweet as they thought it would be. The ones that helped them now demand their due and the favors they promised them, including the death goddess Hela and seductress [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 No. 1 (August 2004)</ref> While they go about their kingdom, they continually turn to their prisoners, Thor and Sif. Sif berates Loki for being jealous of her, and of cutting off her golden hair, only to bring about a greater love between her and Thor. While Balder reminds them that they have died and gone to Hel, while there, sees that there are parallel dimension incarnations of Thor, Loki, and Balder: Some different, yet all play the same roles. And Loki's role is never to rule. Loki then turns to Karnilla, and agrees to free Balder into her care, in exchange for her to peer into a myriad other dimensions.<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 #2 (September 2004)</ref> There they see confirmation of Balder's words, all with Thor triumphant. Loki decides that Thor will indeed die at dawn by beheading. As they're walking out of the dungeons, they run into [[F\u00e1rbauti]], their birth father.<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 No. 3 (October 2004)</ref> Loki decides to go against fate, and spare their brother as well as free him, while Hela is revealed to be a failed illusion cast by another Loki to convince them to kill their brother. Thor decides that when breaking free from their prison, he will defeat his sibling.<ref>''Loki'' Vol 1 No. 4 (November 2004)</ref>\n\n===Heroes Reborn===\nIn the reality of [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|''Heroes Reborn'']], Loki set forth to return to Asgard where they find that the Rainbow bridge is missing and, upon searching mystically, realizes that the nine worlds of Asgard are seemingly missing. They go searching for their brother and finds him frozen in a block of ice in Norway, where he has just been discovered by archeologist Dr. Donald Blake. Loki attempts to destroy Thor then and there and finds that their magics are unable to do so. To their surprise, they found that they had been reborn in this reality and recently grouped together. Blake showed the Avengers the frozen Thor and after they work together to free him from the ice, Loki tricked the confused Thor into battling the Avengers. Thor eventually realized his sibling's deception and watched as the Scarlet Witch banished Loki into limbo. They offered Thor a spot on the team and he accepted.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 2 No. 1 (Nov 1996)</ref>\n\nRealizing this universe had no Asgard, and as such no Odin, Loki decided a larger revenge scheme was in order, and sought out Enchantress to help them in this end. They sought to take control of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and make her their pawn. In doing so, they incapacitated her teacher [[Agatha Harkness]], trapping her essence in a tree and had the Enchantress pose as her. The Enchantress then put the Scarlet Witch under her spell. Loki meanwhile tricked the Hulk into attacking Avengers Island, causing a breach in the gamma core there; however, an assemblage of the Avengers and [[Fantastic Four]] prevented any disaster from happening.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 2 #4\u20136 (Feb. \u2013 Apr. 1997)</ref>\n\nRealizing the foes that some people on this world had a unique energy that Loki could absorb (thereby absorbing their bodies), they sought out these beings and absorbed their power. While keeping the Avengers busy they absorbed the forms of [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], [[Baron Zemo]], [[MODOK]], Executioner, [[Wonder Man]] and others; they also tricked the Avengers [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] to join their ranks, transferring Hellcat's essence into Scarlet Witch's body. Thor soon grew tired of the Avengers' morality on killing their foes and left the group, becoming easy prey for the Enchantress to enthrall them to joining Loki's side.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 2 #8\u20139 (June\u2013July 1997)</ref>\n\nLoki soon learned that the source of the power they were absorbing came from the gamma core on Avengers Island, which was a rift in time and space that was seemingly creating villains for the Avengers to fight. They sent their minions to attack the remaining Avengers (now teamed with the true Thor of Earth-616) while they absorbed this power. When Loki absorbed the power from the gamma core, they were given untold power and grew to gigantic proportions. When Thor and Enchantress attempted to join them, they betrayed them. Realizing this betrayal, Hawkeye, Thor, Enchantress and Hellcat go over to the heroes side and Enchantress, Agatha Harkness and Scarlet Witch pool their magical powers to turn one of the Thor's into a giant replica of Odin to battle Loki while the other Avengers work to build a device that will reverse Loki's newly obtained powers. Captain America goes toe-to-toe against Loki buying the others enough time to hit Loki with their power reversal cannon and allowing Thor to strike them with his hammer. The resulting combination causes Loki to suddenly disburse into the energy that they absorbed, seemingly destroying them and ending their threat.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 No. 11 (Sept 1997)</ref>\n\n===Earth X===\n[[File:Loki Laufeyson (Earth X).jpg|thumb|upright|Loki in alternate universe Earth X. Art by [[Matt Hollingsworth]]]]\nIn the reality of [[Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman, saying he needed to learn humility in the form of a female. They later cast a spell on the Bifrost that if Thor would return to Asgard, Loki would get free rein on Earth.<ref>''Earth X'' Vol 1 No. 5 (Aug 1999)</ref> In this reality, Loki figured out that Asgardians aren't actually gods, but are instead long-lived mutants of incredible power who are mentally mind-locked by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] into believing that they are immortal, never-changing gods so that they won't evolve further as mutants and potentially become a threat to their plans for Earth in the future. They first tell Odin and the others of their true origin and they refuse to believe them. In order to make them see the truth, they stab themselves in the heart and is cast into Hela's realm of the dead. They then convince them to oppose the Celestials' attack on Earth, but when fighting the Celestials, they make the Asgardians think that they are nothing and already dead, all except Loki.<ref>''Earth X'' Vol 1 #X (June 2000)</ref>\n\nYears later, Odin sent Thor to Earth as a champion to battle Loki, but Loki convinced Thor of Odin's manipulation over the Asgardians and the two team up to battle him.<ref>''Universe X'' Vol 1 No. 4 (Jan 2001)</ref> After Odin was defeated and Earth was safe, Thor reverted to his form of Donald Blake and Loki transformed themselves into a new Thor, and, with [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Black Bolt]], they became a new incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''Paradise X'' No. 4 (Sept 2002)</ref>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\nIn the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] timeline (Earth-691), Loki is alive and well in the 31st Century, living on the moon. They lead an attack on Asgard with their squad of Inhuman Assassins for Composite's sonic diffusion muzzle when they are stopped by Woden Thorson, their nephew.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' No. 42 (Nov 1993)</ref> With the help of [[Talon (Marvel Comics)|Talon]] and [[Aleta Ogord|Aleta]], they imprison Loki.

Seeking to take advantage of this, a corporation called \"Alchemax\" decided to create their own Valhalla. One of the company's scientists, Jordan Boone, decided that he wanted to have powers and snuck into the program where he became Loki but still maintained their own personality. Boone (Loki) helps [[Doom 2099|Doom]], [[Krystalin]], [[Bloodhawk]], [[Skullfire|Timothy Fitzgerald]] and [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] fight Alchemax's versions of Thor and Heimdall. After Heimdall is defeated, Loki watches as Doom defeats Thor, gloating about their plan to pit Alchemax and heroes against each other to gain enough superpower to shapeshift out of it. They transform into a bird and flies away.<ref>''X-Men 2099'' Vol 1 No. 5 (Feb 1994)</ref>\n\nWhen Loki is next seen, they appear as the villainous Halloween Jack after being tortured by Desdemona and her brother, Lytton, after they accuse them of cheating in their casino.

They attack her, revealing to her their true form (Loki) and hacks into her accounts and plans to make Vegas fun again.<ref>''X-Men 2099'' Vol 1 No. 17 (Feb 1995)</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the alternate ''[[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, Loki is shown dead, having been killed and eaten by the Zombie Avengers.<ref name=\"mzr1\">''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'' Vol 1.

They tie them up and takes them to Asgard, where they want to use Thunderstrike's mace's powers for themselves, but Kevin disrupts the spell, absorbing the mace into himself and transforming into a new Thunderstrike in the process. Loki and their army of Trolls are defeated by the heroes, with help from Thor, now the King of Asgard, and Loki and their army retreated. Thunderstrike, Stinger, J2 and Mainframe decide to stay together as the new Avengers. The adult heroes decline to stay with the reformed team because of personal reasons.<ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1 No. 1 (Oct 1998)</ref>\n\nYears later, Loki is bitter about the fact that they were the cause of the Avengers' formation and wants to get their revenge. They start kidnapping heroes, holding them prisoner in life-sized crystals when [[Captain America]], J2, Thunderstrike, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]] show up through a portal they found in another universe. The heroes are quickly outnumbered by Loki's robots and they vow to end ''The Age of Heroes''.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' Vol. 1 No. 2 (Sept 2005)</ref>\n\nJ2 and Spider-Girl escape but Captain America and Thunderstrike are chained and Loki plans to brainwash the heroes to send them back to Earth where they will become violent and turn against each so they will eventually destroy all the heroes. Their plan is ruined by Thor when they shows up after figuring out why certain superheroes are acting so much differently. Together, Thor, Captain America, Hulk and Spider-Girl get Loki to surrender. Captain America notices a gem hanging on Loki's neck, and smashes it with his shield. Loki was using this gem to help turn the heroes evil but once the gem is destroyed, the heroes revert to normal. A furious Loki releases a deadly blast on Captain America, killing him. Thor uses his hammer and sends Loki into Limbo forever and the Hulk decides to join them to make sure that Loki remains there. After Captain America dies, Thor uses his hammer to grant Captain America's soul immortality. His soul floats into the skies, and creates a shiny new, bright star in the sky in the form of Captain America's shield, meant to always inspire the heroes and future generations to come.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' Vol. 1 #2\u20133 (Oct - Nov 2005)</ref>\n\nIn this universe, Loki has a daughter, Sylene.

In the restaurant, Loki is apparently in the background, which would mark their first \"appearance\" (he is mentioned and his powers apparently used, but they are only briefly seen).<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #1\"/> Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room Without Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the [[United States]] after assisting the [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]] (multinational group of superpowered villains representing [[Syria]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Russia]], [[North Korea]], and [[France]]). Through their power they create the persona for themselves of \"'''Gunnar Golmen'''\", the head scientist of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] extension of the \"European Defense Initiative\", the European counterpart to The Ultimates, and turns Thor into \"Thorlief\", Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #4</ref>\n\nLater in the story, they confront the captive Thor and gloats that it is all just another one of their games, and informs him that there is a traitor in the ranks of the Ultimates. When Thor requests assistance from the guards, Loki is nowhere to be seen, though they appears as a snake around Thor's neck after they leave (most likely a nod to the real Loki in Norse mythology).<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #6</ref> At the end of ''Ultimates 2'' No. 9, Loki states that the reason they joined the Liberators was because \"They had a Norse god on their side. It's only fair you should get one too\", and that \"Odin sent his son to bring the world peace. I couldn't resist the opportunity to mess that up.\"<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #9</ref> However, they are hesitant to use their abilities overtly as they claim Odin will then be able to find them. Yet once all The Liberators are defeated, they decide to do things themselves. After revealing to the Ultimates who they truly are, they rise into the air and change the color of the sky. At that moment\u2014thanks to the Scarlet Witch 'calculating the odds' of someone showing up to defeat them\u2014the sky opens and Thor, his brother, appears for revenge.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #12</ref>\n\nIssue 13 shows further demonstrations of their power by attempting to trap Thor in an illusion and withstanding a direct blow from Thor's hammer uninjured, claiming it cannot hurt them. During this battle, Thor mentions that Loki's powers have weakened for an unexplained reason. After Loki summons an army of monsters to battle the Ultimates and nearly kills Thor, the thunder god then proceeds to summon allies from Asgard while he strikes Loki with his hammer, sending them back to Asgard where Odin awaits.<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #13\">''Ultimates 2'' #13</ref>\n\nLoki's motivation for their actions is not completely revealed. They mention several motivations, from a desire to cause World War III to Odin favoring Thor over them and attempting to gain Odin's favor.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #8</ref> Throughout the whole ordeal, Loki regards humans as mere playthings for their pranks. In addition to creating a Norwegian super-soldier program that was supposedly part of an EU initiative and making people believe it was real, even though Norway is not part of the [[European Union]], they claimed to have been the one who framed [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] for treason and murdering [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'s family, regarding the failure of humans to realize the problems with these assertions as humorous.<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #13\"/>\n\nLoki is freed from their \"punishment\" in ''[[New Ultimates]]'',<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1</ref> playing an integral part in the re-appearance of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], now super-powered, as well the invasion of trolls to [[New York City|New York]] with the help of [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]].<ref name=\"New Ultimates #2\">''New Ultimates'' #2</ref> They are later revealed to be the one behind [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]'s powers manifesting after the invasion forces attacked America.<ref name=\"New Ultimates #2\"/> In revenge against Thor, Loki impales Valkyrie with a sword, to which she is restored by [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] as a real Valkyrie and takes vengeance on Loki, banishing them to [[Hel (location)|Hel]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'' #5</ref> Loki and every other Asgardian, excluding Thor were killed by the Children of Tomorrow (led by [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Marvel|Reed Richards]]) when Asgard was destroyed.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #2</ref>\n\n''[[Ultimate Comics: Thor]]'' elaborates Loki's backstory. Loki is the child of Odin and the giantess Laufey, who procreated them as part of a peace settlement between Asgard and Jotunheim. Loki was always jealous of their older brother Thor for having been given Mjolnir and rebelled against Asgard by stealing the sacred Norn Stones (relic extensions of Odin's power) and killing their half-brother Balder with their favoured bow. Banished from Asgard, Loki (going under the disguise of Nazi supervillain [[Baron Zemo]]) waged an attack on the kingdom eons later, in 1939, with a coalition army of Frost Giants and Nazi soldiers, killing every Asgardian in sight. Loki attempted a battle with Odin, only to be forced into the Room Without Doors while Asgard was destroyed. Using the Stones, Loki is later summoned by an older Nazi, [[Helmut Zemo]] (around the time The Hulk was fighting the Ultimates in [[Manhattan]] during Ultimates vol. 1). For his loyalty, Loki kills him.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Thor'' #4</ref>\n\n===Goddess of Thunder===\nReality on Earth-1026, Thor has met and fallen in love with [[Ororo Munroe]] from the [[X-Men]]. Loki casts a spell on [[Tarene]], who is insanely jealous of Ororo because she too has feelings for Thor. Maddened by Loki's spell, Tarene goes after Ororo and is killed by Thor when he steps in to protect her.

After not being able to take it anymore, they stabbed Thor, and proceeded to destroy the Earth, killing everyone on it. King Thor comes to seek revenge, but King Loki raises the undead Avengers to attack him. Knowing they cannot defeat their brother, King Loki retreats to the past, where they plan to kill the Odinson while he cannot wield Mjolnir.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #12\"/> This future was ultimately avoided when the present Loki changes their fate, but King Loki is still at large.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #13\"/>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, King Loki devises a plan that involves traveling to Hel to free a monster that will destroy Asgard. The Asgardians later gather to witness King Loki on the back of the Midgard Serpent where they believe that this will be their end.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #14\"/> However, the real Loki appears and wards them off, just as the universe ends. As Loki is now the God of Stories though, he saves a memory of the universe in the form of a story. After everything in existence is gone, Loki confronts a crying King Loki. As Loki would not be here without them, they embrace their no-longer future self.

In the episode \"Thor the Mighty\", they manipulate a Frost Giants group into attacking [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] while [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is on Earth. Following the Frost Giants' defeat by Thor, Loki ends up fighting their brother but is defeated and banished by [[Odin (character)|Odin]] to the Isle of Silence where they are unable to use their magic/trickery. After [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] frees them, Loki is implied to be the [[Masters of Evil]]'s shadowy benefactor seen at the end of \"Masters of Evil\". In season one's three-part season finale (\"This Hostage Earth\", \"The Fall of Asgard\" and \"A Day Unlike Any Other\"), Loki returns having conquered Asgard as well as eight of the nine realms by corrupting the Tree of Life. Loki attempts to invade Earth by having the Masters of Evil steal the Norn Stones from the sorceress [[Karnilla]] in order to transport his forces to Midgard and effortlessly conquer the planet. However, their plan fails, as the Avengers manage to destroy the stones and transport themselves to each of the eight mythical realms. When Thor is captured, Loki reveals being behind everything from his brother's exile to the Avengers' creation with the super-villain prison breakout and the Masters of Evil, with Loki admitting that both their initial attack on Asgard and their own exile (back in \"Thor the Mighty\") was simply a diversion so that they would not be perceived as a threat while on Earth. Eventually, Loki engages the Avengers and numerous Asgardian warriors in a final showdown to stop the God of Mischief from conquering the nine realms. Although they destroy [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and fights [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armor|Asgardian-buster armor]] to a standstill, Loki is stopped when [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]] pulls out the Tree of Life, in which a new tree regrows and disconnects Loki from the Odinforce. It also allows Odin to regain consciousness and banish Loki again. Despite their defeat, Loki pledges that they will never stop trying to conquer Asgard and will suffer a thousand times worse. Loki is then shown in a swamp-like realm where they are tortured by the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] dripping poison into their eyes while Loki screams hysterically at their endless torment.\n* Loki appears in the [[Disney XD]]-produced Marvel cartoons,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=815|title=Marvel Animation Age - The Marvel Animation News Resource|work=toonzone.net|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}</ref> voiced by [[Troy Baker]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Doomstroyer|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=10|airdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref> \n** In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, Loki has dealing with [[Spider-Man]]. In the episode \"Field Trip\", they use sorcery to transform Thor into a frog to take over Asgard and attack Odin while he was sleeping. Despite the Frost Giants at their disposal, Spider-Man tricks Loki into reversing his own spell on Thor which leads to their defeat. Loki later tries to get their vengeance on Spider-Man in the episode \"Run Pig Run\" where they turn Spider-Man into a [[Spider-Ham|pig]] to be hunted by the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] and the episode \"Itsy Bitsy Spider-Man\" where they disguise themselves as a weird kid (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Itsy Bitsy Spider-Man|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=12|airdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref>) that torments the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D.

Loki has a supporting role in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors''. In the two-part \"Avenging Spider-Man\", Loki partners with [[Doctor Octopus]] to take revenge on Spider-Man and the Avengers. After switching bodies with their shared nemesis, Loki [as Spider-Man] (voiced by [[Drake Bell]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Avenging Spider-Man, Part 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=1|airdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref>) leads various creatures from various realms that were experimented on with the mass-produced [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote thanks to Doc Ock before switching bodies back with Spider-Man. After the rampaging Venom creatures are defeated by the Avengers and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees and sent the creatures back their respective realms, Loki is cast out of Earth and then attacked by a number of vengeful creatures.\n** In the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, Loki appears as an occasional antagonist to the Avengers, specifically Thor. In the episode \"The Doomstroyer\", they work with the Avengers to stop the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] that was hijacked by [[Doctor Doom]]. With Loki's help, Thor, Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] trace Doctor Doom to Helheim with the Helhorn as the Destroyer's controller while guarded by the Midgard Serpent. After Iron Man gets Doctor Doom to deactivate the Destroyer and Captain America removes the Helhorn from Doctor Doom then is evacuated from Helheim and returned to Latveria, Loki tries to take control of the Destroyer but is stopped by the Avengers. In the episode \"Valhalla Can Wait\", Loki manipulates a confrontation between Thor and the [[Hulk]] while impersonating ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Megan McLaren]] (voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Valhalla Can Wait|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=3|airdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>). With Thor and Hulk in Valhalla, they makes a deal with [[Hela (comics)|Hela]]; Loki borrows the Horn of Hela to control the skeleton minions while Hela's entertained with Hulk and Thor fighting each other. After having a giant skeleton rampage around, Loki later fights with Thor and Hulk where the two Avengers take a dive against him. Hela, now having realized Loki's plans, deems Loki the winner of the fight and takes Loki back to Valhalla for entertainment. In the episode \"Back to the Learning Hall\", Loki uses the [[Infinity Gems|Space Stone]] to make Asgard crash into Earth. At the same time, they have Thor come to Asgard in order to mess with their brother once again while also using the Space Stone to escape Valhalla. However, Thor overcomes the mind games and defeats Loki, resulting in their incarceration in Asgard. In the episode \"Spectrums\", a spectral replica of Loki appears as a manifestation of Thor's nightmares thanks to [[Doctor Spectrum]], with the manifestation based on Thor's belief that Loki's villainous tendencies are the result of Thor's neglect to protect Loki. Thor eventually overcomes the illusion by acknowledging the failure and remaining hopeful Loki will change. Loki has a minor appearance in ''Avengers: Ultron Revolution'', remaining incarcerated in Asgard's dungeons. Loki has a central appearance in ''Avengers: Secret Wars'', using the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] and the Casket of Ancient Winters to take control of Earth while the Avengers and [[The New Avengers (comics)|the New Avengers]] were unavailable.

Mike Abary, senior vice president of Samsung's U.S. PC and tablet businesses, also stated that the company was unable to build the Ativ Tab to meet its target price point{{emdash}}considering that lower cost was intended to be a selling point for Windows RT devices.<ref name=cnet-winrtsamsung /> Samsung has also reportedly planned to pull the Ativ Tab from Germany and other unspecified European markets for similar reasons.<ref name=engadget-ativgermany>{{cite web|title=Samsung will stop sale of Windows RT tablets in Germany due to weak demand, according to reports|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/06/samsung-windows-rt-ativ-tab-germany/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWhilst demoing the device at IFA, [[TechRadar]] praised the Ativ Tab's \"crisp\" screen, lightweight design, and the ability to expand its functionality and storage with its USB port and MicroSD card slot.

The tablet's relatively \"snappy\" performance, battery life, and lightweight design were regarded as positive aspects{{emdash}}despite considering the design itself to be \"nothing particularly new or exciting.\" The Qualcomm APQ8060A chipset used in the Ativ Tab was also judged as being the best processor for Windows RT so far, noting that its performance was sufficient and \"surprisingly competitive\" in comparison to the chipsets used in competing Windows RT devices.

A micro [[HDMI]] port, [[MicroSD]] slot, and a full-size [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port are incorporated into the design, as well as a volume rocker, power button, and headphone jack located on the top. A physical [[Windows key|Windows button]] is located directly below the screen. A charging port and dock connector are located on the bottom. The Ativ Tab uses a  {{convert|10.1|in|cm|sing=on}} [[IPS panel|IPS]] display at a resolution of 1366x768.

Mike Abary, senior vice president of Samsung's U.S. PC and tablet businesses, also stated that the company was unable to build the Ativ Tab to meet its target price point{{emdash}}considering that lower cost was intended to be a selling point for Windows RT devices.<ref name=cnet-winrtsamsung>{{cite web|last=Tibken|first=Shara|title=Uh-oh, Windows RT, Samsung's got second thoughts|url=http://ces.cnet.com/8301-34439_1-57563340/uh-oh-windows-rt-samsungs-got-second-thoughts/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref> Samsung has also reportedly planned to pull the Ativ Tab from Germany and other unspecified European markets for similar reasons.<ref name=engadget-ativgermany>{{cite web|title=Samsung will stop sale of Windows RT tablets in Germany due to weak demand, according to reports|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/06/samsung-windows-rt-ativ-tab-germany/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWhilst demoing the device at IFA, [[TechRadar]] praised the Ativ Tab's \"crisp\" screen, lightweight design, and the ability to expand its functionality and storage with its USB port and MicroSD card slot. However, it was also said that while its processor was relatively responsive, it \"certainly wasn't in the same league as the [[Samsung Galaxy Note II|Galaxy Note 2]].\"<ref name=tr-ifareview>{{cite web|title=Hands on: Samsung Ativ Tab review|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/samsung-ativ-tab-1094049/review|publisher=TechRadar|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Anandtech]] said that despite not being the best substitute for an actual notebook due to the lagging performance of ARM-based processors and the rushed nature of the OS, the Ativ Tab was \"well executed\" for a first-generation Windows RT device. The tablet's relatively \"snappy\" performance, battery life, and lightweight design were regarded as positive aspects{{emdash}}despite considering the design itself to be \"nothing particularly new or exciting.\" The Qualcomm APQ8060A chipset used in the Ativ Tab was also judged as being the best processor for Windows RT so far, noting that its performance was sufficient and \"surprisingly competitive\" in comparison to the chipsets used in competing Windows RT devices.
