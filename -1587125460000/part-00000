There were 15 to 20 men in the camp, but no women. The men did not stop long. In those days, they didn\u2019t have much \u2014 a broad axe, a bundle of wedges, a cross-cut saw, their clothes, and perhaps a tent. The ship Charlie remembered coming to pick up sleepers was the old ''Queen Bee''. It was apparently a steamer, but under powered: \u2018they reckoned they had to stop the engine to blow the whistle!\u2019 Loading was from the beach, and the sleeper-cutters had to come in from their camp to help with the loading: Kioloa mill had not been rebuilt at that time, so there were no men about to lend a hand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hamon |first1=Bruce |title=They Came to Murramarang |date=Oct 2015 |publisher=ANU Press |isbn=9781925022759 |pages=51 |url=https://doi.org/10.22459/TCM.10.2015}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Industrial Disputes===\nFrom 1906, several unions came together to form the [[Seamen's Union of Australia]] as well as the earlier 1902 [[Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia]].

Captain Hacking the Deputy Superintendent of Navigation stated that the bigger part of the ''Queen Bee's'' cargo was for the Sydney [[Pilot boat|pilot steamer]] ''Captain Cook'' which would absorb nearly 100 tons of the ''Queen Bee's'' coal.

He stated that he unloaded his vessels on the lump principle, and paid each man 17s per load and that the operation of unloading typically took about 15 hours. He stated that in the previous 12 months the ''Queen Bee'' had carried 26,292 tons of coal, and allowing the average of 12 tons an hour for unloading two men could have averaged \u00a32 3s 3d per week. In answer to the union, he indicated that he paid his sailors \u00a38 per month and 1s 3d per hour overtime for all work done at night. Their food averaged him 16s per man per week. On his timber vessels the sailors only received \u00a36 month. with the sailors averaged 7 to 8 tons of coal, per hour; and sometimes as few as 5 tons. There was no deduction from their wages for holidays.\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article115251372 |title=WORK IN COAL YARDS. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]] |issue=13,455 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=25 July 1910 |accessdate=26 August 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===March 1920 tail-shaft mishap===\nDuring a trip from Sydney to Newcastle on the 17 March 1920 the coastal trader ''Queen Bee'', had left Sydney shortly before noon when about three miles off [[Long Reef (New South Wales)|Long Reef]] struck a submerged object and broke the port propeller shaft.

Under the charge of Captain A. Gardiner and a crew of eight hands, the ''Queen Bee'' left Newcastle on the Friday at 4:40pm for Sydney with a full cargo of coal. A south-easterly breeze prevailed during the night, and the vessel met a slight swell. The weather was fine, except for a few clouds, and it was moon light. As she made her way down the coast all appeared to be well with the little vessel.\n\nGood progress was made until the vessel was five miles east-north-east of [[Barrenjoey Head Lighthouse|Barrenjoey lighthouse]], when the engineer of the vessel, Mr. Williams noticed a sudden rush of water. It was then 12:05am, he sensed something irregular in the vessel's movements. Investigating the matter he found that the vessel was making water in the bows. Realising the danger which threatened the vessel was turned towards Broken Bay. The position of the vessel was a few miles away from the nearest beach, but Captain Gardiner hoped at least to reach one of the beaches and ground the vessel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136717555 |title=COLLIER FOUNDERS. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Weekly Mercury]] |issue=1495 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 September 1922 |accessdate=26 August 2019 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nEvents now happened, however, with dramatic rapidity, and within twenty five minutes of the leak being discovered, the vessel had foundered. The water was found to be making rapidly, and efforts at increased speed only increased the flow. In the dim moonlight the crew could see that the bow of the vessel was slowly settling down. The ship's boat, which was on the bridge deck, was manned and the crew scrambled into the boat, some having to jump from the deck. In the confusing light the engineer misjudged the position of the boat and his leap ended in the water. With feverish haste he was hauled on board, and the crew commenced to pull away. After a few strokes the ''Queen Bee'' seemed to rise slightly and then settled finally into the swell.\n\nThe shore some miles away was fit fully visible in the fading moonlight, and the party rowed on for [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]]. Here they landed and proceeded to the house of the post-mistress. After being served with hot coffee and their clothes drying alongside the fire, the whole company was picked up by motor car at 5 0 'clock, and brought back to Sydney.\n\nMr. R. V. Saddington, one of the part-owners of the vessel, stated at the news of her loss that it was one of the greatest shocks he had ever received.

There were 15 to 20 men in the camp, but no women. The men did not stop long. In those days, they didn\u2019t have much \u2014 a broad axe, a bundle of wedges, a cross-cut saw, their clothes, and perhaps a tent. The ship Charlie remembered coming to pick up sleepers was the old ''Queen Bee''. It was apparently a steamer, but under powered: \u2018they reckoned they had to stop the engine to blow the whistle!\u2019 Loading was from the beach, and the sleeper-cutters had to come in from their camp to help with the loading: Kioloa mill had not been rebuilt at that time, so there were no men about to lend a hand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hamon |first1=Bruce |title=They Came to Murramarang |date=Oct 2015 |publisher=ANU Press |isbn=9781925022759 |pages=51 |url=https://doi.org/10.22459/TCM.10.2015}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Industrial Disputes===\nFrom 1906, several unions came together to form the [[Seamen's Union of Australia]] as well as the earlier 1902 [[Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia]].

Captain Hacking the Deputy Superintendent of Navigation stated that the bigger part of the ''Queen Bee's'' cargo was for the Sydney [[Pilot boat|pilot steamer]] ''Captain Cook'' which would absorb nearly 100 tons of the ''Queen Bee's'' coal.

He stated that he unloaded his vessels on the lump principle, and paid each man 17s per load and that the operation of unloading typically took about 15 hours. He stated that in the previous 12 months the ''Queen Bee'' had carried 26,292 tons of coal, and allowing the average of 12 tons an hour for unloading two men could have averaged \u00a32 3s 3d per week. In answer to the union, he indicated that he paid his sailors \u00a38 per month and 1s 3d per hour overtime for all work done at night. Their food averaged him 16s per man per week. On his timber vessels the sailors only received \u00a36 month. with the sailors averaged 7 to 8 tons of coal, per hour; and sometimes as few as 5 tons.

Under the charge of Captain A. Gardiner and a crew of eight hands, the ''Queen Bee'' left Newcastle on the Friday at 4:40pm for Sydney with a full cargo of coal. A south-easterly breeze prevailed during the night, and the vessel met a slight swell. The weather was fine, except for a few clouds, and it was moon light. As she made her way down the coast all appeared to be well with the little vessel.\n\nGood progress was made until the vessel was five miles east-north-east of [[Barrenjoey Head Lighthouse|Barrenjoey lighthouse]], when the engineer of the vessel, Mr. Williams noticed a sudden rush of water. It was then 12:05am, he sensed something irregular in the vessel's movements. Investigating the matter he found that the vessel was making water in the bows. Realising the danger which threatened the vessel was turned towards Broken Bay. The position of the vessel was a few miles away from the nearest beach, but Captain Gardiner hoped at least to reach one of the beaches and ground the vessel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136717555 |title=COLLIER FOUNDERS. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Weekly Mercury]] |issue=1495 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 September 1922 |accessdate=26 August 2019 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nEvents now happened, however, with dramatic rapidity, and within twenty five minutes of the leak being discovered, the vessel had foundered. The water was found to be making rapidly, and efforts at increased speed only increased the flow. In the dim moonlight the crew could see that the bow of the vessel was slowly settling down. The ship's boat, which was on the bridge deck, was manned and the crew scrambled into the boat, some having to jump from the deck. In the confusing light the engineer misjudged the position of the boat and his leap ended in the water. With feverish haste he was hauled on board, and the crew commenced to pull away. After a few strokes the ''Queen Bee'' seemed to rise slightly and then settled finally into the swell.\n\nThe shore some miles away was fit fully visible in the fading moonlight, and the party rowed on for [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]]. Here they landed and proceeded to the house of the post-mistress. After being served with hot coffee and their clothes drying alongside the fire, the whole company was picked up by motor car at 5 0 'clock, and brought back to Sydney.\n\nMr. R. V. Saddington, one of the part-owners of the vessel, stated at the news of her loss that it was one of the greatest shocks he had ever received. 'We looked upon the Queen Bee as being quite sound and equal in sea going qualities to anything plying in the coal fleet' said Mr. Saddington. 'Some time ago we spent a large sum of money in having various things done to the vessel, and' we have never had a complaint about the boat.' <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161546513 |title=Foundered Off Broken Bay. |newspaper=[[The Gosford Times And Wyong District Advocate]] |volume=XXXVI |issue=593 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=7 September 1922 |accessdate=26 August 2019 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/maritimeheritageapp/ViewSiteDetail.aspx?siteid=733\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{1922 shipwrecks}}\n{{Navbox shipwrecks of New South Wales|Wrecksnorthsydney}}\n\n{{coord|-33.555108|151.394585|type:landmark_region:AU|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of the Northern Sydney Region]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1907 ships]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1922]]\n[[Category:1922 in Australia]]\n[[Category:1901 \u2013 World War I ships of Australia]]\n[[Category:Interwar period ships of Australia]]\n[[Category:Colliers of Australia]]\n[[Category:Wooden steamships of Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "miscapitalization (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Bee_(steamer)"}

He was one of the most significant reformers involved with the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\n== Life ==\nHe was the son of [[C\u00e6sar von Pflug]], who acted as commissary for the [[Elector of Saxony]] in the [[Leipzig Disputation]] in 1519.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Julius Von Pflug}}</ref> He studied at the universities of [[Leipzig]] (1510\u201317) and [[Bologna]] (1517\u201319), and returned to [[Germany]] in 1519 to become canon in [[Meissen]]. Disturbed by the religious controversies at home, he returned to Bologna, whence he went to [[Padua]], but in 1521, induced by offers of preferment from [[George, Duke of Saxony|Duke George]], he returned to his native state, first of all to [[Dresden]], and then to Leipzig, where he still continued to devote himself chiefly to humanistic interests.\n\nIn 1528\u201329 he was again in [[Italy]], and in 1530 he accompanied Duke George to the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. At this time he became a correspondent of [[Erasmus]], and in his letters to him unfolded his plan for restoring religious peace to Germany. Everything could be done, he thought, by the influence of moderate men like Erasmus and [[Melanchthon]]. Erasmus replied that things had gone so far that even a council could be of no help; one party wanted revolution, the other would tolerate no reform. In 1532 Pflug became dean of Zeitz, where he had to grapple with the practical question of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], since not only was the bishop, who was also diocesan of [[Freising]], continually absent, but the neighboring Protestant [[elector of Saxony]] was alleging claims of jurisdiction over the [[Episcopal See|See]].\n\nPflug was in favor of lay [[communion under both kinds]], the marriage of the priesthood, and general moral reform. He took part in the [[Leipzig Colloquy]] in 1534, and as dean of Meissen prepared for the clergy of the diocese the constitutions reprinted in the ''Leges seu constitutiones ecclesi\u0153 Budissinensis'' (1573). As one of the envoys of [[John of Meissen]], Pflug endeavored, in 1539, to secure from the papal nuncio, Alexander, who was then at [[Vienna]], adhesion to his project for a reform of [[Roman Catholicism]] along the lines already indicated, only to be obliged to wait for the decision of the pope.\n\nThe Reformation was now carried through in Meissen, and Pflug took refuge in Zeitz, later retiring to his canonry at [[Maintz]], and thus rendering Zeitz more accessible to the [[Protestant]] movement. In 1541 he was appointed bishop of [[Naumburg]], but [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick]], the elector of Saxony, hating all men of moderation, forbade him to occupy his see. Pflug was uncertain whether he would accept the nomination or not; and meanwhile the elector, after vainly urging the chapter to nominate another bishop, turned the cathedral of Naumburg over to Protestant services and proposed to provide for the election of a bishop according to his liking.\n\nThe elector's theologians, though exceedingly dubious regarding his course, finally yielded, and John Frederick selected [[Nicolaus von Amsdorf]] for the place and had him ordained by Luther. On 15 January 1542, however, Pflug accepted his election to the bishopric, and sought to have his rights protected by the diets of [[Speyer]] (1542, 1544), [[Nuremberg]] (1543), and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] (1545). At the latter diet the emperor directed the elector to admit Pflug to his bishopric, and to repudiate Amsdorf and the secular directors of the chapter. John Frederick refused, however, and the question was settled only by the [[Schmalkaldic War]].\n\nHitherto Pflug had been in favor of a Roman Catholic reform of a far-reaching character, as was shown by his part at the [[Regensburg Conference]] of 1541 where he disputed with [[Johannes Eck]] and [[Johann Gropper]]; but political conditions and his troubles with the elector of Saxony now made him a bitter opponent of the Reformation. In 1547, when the Schmalkaldic War closed, Pflug took possession of his bishopric under imperial protection. He was a prominent factor in the negotiations which resulted in the [[Augsburg Interim]], the basis of which was formed by the revision of his ''Formula sacrorum emendandorum'' by himself, [[Michael Helding]], [[Johannes Agricola]], [[Domingo de Soto]], and [[Pedro de Malvenda]]. Pflug now entertained still higher hopes of realizing his reform of Roman Catholicism. He took part in negotiations in Pegau, continuing them in a secret correspondence with Melanchthon to induce him and Prince [[George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|George of Anhalt]] to accept a modified sacrificial theory of the Mass; and he was also concerned in the deliberations between [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice]] and [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]] and their theologians at [[J\u00fcterbog]].\n\nThe result was the first draft of the [[Leipzig Interim]], which was submitted to the national diet in his presence. In his own diocese Pflug refrained from disturbing the Lutherans, restoring Roman Catholic worship only in the chief church in Zeitz and the cathedral of Naumburg, and even permitting Protestant services to be held in the latter. There was almost an entire dearth of Roman Catholic clergy, nor could he secure a sufficient number from other dioceses. He was accordingly forced to allow the married ministers whom Amsdorf had placed in office to retain their positions, though without Roman Catholic ordination. In November 1551, he was present for a short time at the [[Council of Trent]]. Even after the final success of the Protestants in 1552, he remained in undisturbed possession of his see, thanks to his popularity and moderation; and after the abdication of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], he urged the best interests of Germany in his ''Oratio de ordinanda republica Germani\u0153'' ([[Cologne]], 1562).\n\nIn 1557 he presided at the [[Colloquy of Worms (1557)|Colloquy of Worms]], but was unable to prevent the [[Flacians]] from wrecking negotiations. To the last, however, he hoped that, when the Council of Trent reassembled, his moderate program would be successful in restoring religious peace.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{Schaff-Herzog}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Jacques V.

Kaylan and Volman later found long-lasting success as [[session musician]]s, billed as the comedic vocal duo Flo & Eddie. In 2010, a reconstituted version of the band, the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie, began performing live shows again.\n\n==History==\nThe band, originally a [[Surf music|surf rock]] group called The Crossfires, was formed in 1965 in [[Westchester, Los Angeles]] by high school friends Kaylan, Volman, [[Al Nichol]], [[Chuck Portz]], [[Don Murray (drummer)|Don Murray]], and Jim Tucker.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1196}}</ref> With the help of [[KRLA]] and [[KFWB]] [[DJ]] and club owner [[Reb Foster]] (born James Dennis Bruton, March 18, 1936 &ndash; August 25, 2019),<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/ \"Reb Foster, One of the 11-10 Men at KRLA, Dies\"], ''LA Radio'', August 26, 2019. Retrieved August 27, 2019</ref> The Crossfires signed to the newly formed [[White Whale Records]]. Adhering to the prevailing musical trend, they rebranded themselves as a [[folk rock]] group under the name The Tyrtles, an intentionally stylized misspelling inspired by [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beatles]]. However, the trendy spelling did not survive long.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAs with the Byrds, the Turtles achieved breakthrough success with a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\" reached the ''Billboard'' Top Ten in the late summer of 1965, and was the title track of the band's first album.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Their second single, \"Let Me Be,\" reached the top 30, while their third hit, \"You Baby,\" charted in the top 20 in early 1966.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band's second album, ''[[You Baby]],'' failed to reach ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s [[Billboard 200|Top LPs]] chart, and of several singles released in 1966, \"[[Grim Reaper of Love]]\" and \"Can I Get to Know You Better\" barely entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. One single, the tough \"Outside Chance\", written by [[Warren Zevon]] and featuring guitar work in the style of The Beatles' \"[[Taxman]]\", did not chart. In 1966, The Turtles made an appearance in [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s [[beach party film|beach party]] [[spy film|spy spoof]] film ''[[Out of Sight (1966 film)|Out of Sight]],'' singing \"She'll Come Back\" on screen.\n\nAt the start of 1966, drummer Don Murray and bassist Chuck Portz quit the group. They were replaced by [[Joel Larson]] and then [[John Barbata]] on drums, and by [[Chip Douglas]] on bass (October 1966).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe first of several key Turtles singles co-written by Garry Bonner and [[Alan Gordon (songwriter)|Alan Gordon]], \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\" had already been rejected by countless performers. \"Happy Together\", both their biggest hit and their signature song, signaled a turning point for both the Turtles and for Chip Douglas, who provided the arrangement.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The single replaced the Beatles' \"[[Penny Lane]]\" at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the spring of 1967. The Turtles' only No.&nbsp;1 remained there for three weeks. An album of the same name followed and peaked at No.&nbsp;25. \"Happy Together\" reached No. 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"betts\">{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Betts|year=2004|title=Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004|edition=1st|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=0-00-717931-6|page=802}}</ref> This same year saw the Turtles performing the title song (composed by [[John Williams]] with lyrics by [[Leslie Bricusse]]) for the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] [[bedroom farce]] ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]].''\n\nImpressed by Chip Douglas's studio arrangements, [[Michael Nesmith]] approached him after a Turtles show at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] and invited him to become [[The Monkees]]' new producer, as that band wanted to break out of their \"manufactured\" studio mold. Douglas accepted and left the Turtles, ultimately producing three Monkees albums: ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]''; ''[[Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.]]'' (both 1967) and co-produced ''[[The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees]]'' (1968). Douglas was replaced by [[Jim Pons]] on bass.\n\n1967 proved to be the Turtles' most successful year on the music charts. \"[[She'd Rather Be with Me]]\" reached No. 3 on the US charts in late spring and actually out-charted \"Happy Together\" overseas, reaching No. 4 in the UK.<ref name=\"betts\"/> Two successive Top 15 songs followed: \"[[You Know What I Mean]]\" and \"She's My Girl\". Both [[Gramophone Record|45]]s signaled a certain shift in the band's style. ''Golden Hits'' was released later that year, charting in the top 10. The similar album covers for ''The Turtles! Golden Hits'' and its follow up ''More Golden Hits'' were designed by [[Dean Torrence]] of [[Jan & Dean]].\n\nIn 1967, rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker left the band citing the pressure of touring and recording new material. He moved to Grass Valley where he became an electrical contractor. He has denied that he left the band because [[John Lennon]] was rude to him as suggested by the Turtles' lead singer Howard Kaylan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eterritorialdispatch.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/interview-with-turtle.html |title=eTerritorial Dispatch: Interview With A Turtle |website=Eterritorialdispatch.blogspot.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first two singles in 1968, \"Sound Asleep\" and \"The Story of Rock and Roll\", stalled somewhere in the middle of the top 100. The band's fortunes changed when Chip Douglas returned to work with them in the studio. Late in 1968 the band released a [[concept album]] called ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', in which the group pretended to be 11 different bands (with fanciful names including 'The Bigg Brothers', 'Nature's Children', 'the US Teens featuring Raoul', and 'the Fabulous Dawgs'), each with a song in a different genre. The album yielded two singles: \"[[Elenore]]\" and \"[[You Showed Me]]\" (both peaking at No.&nbsp;6). \"Elenore\" also reached No.&nbsp;7 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"betts\"/> The 1969 hit \"You Showed Me\" had been written by the Byrds' [[Gene Clark]] and [[Roger McGuinn|Roger (then Jim) McGuinn]] in 1964. Television appearances included a February 1968 spot on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', to which they returned in April 1969.\n\nTowards the end of 1969, the group released its next album, ''[[Turtle Soup]]'', a critically well-received LP produced by [[Ray Davies]] of [[the Kinks]]. Inspired by the revered 1968 concept album ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'', this was Davies's only released production work for another band (although Davies had previously produced demo recordings for [[Badfinger|The Iveys]]). Notable tracks include \"Somewhere Friday Nite\" and \"Love in the City\". In spite of ''Turtle Soup''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s positive reception from the music press, its commercial success was marginal and the band soon began to disintegrate.\n\nLong disillusioned with their record label and its growing financial problems by this time, Kaylan and Volman resisted White Whale's efforts to turn the Turtles into something approaching an assembly-line pop act.

Kaylan and Volman later found long-lasting success as [[session musician]]s, billed as the comedic vocal duo Flo & Eddie. In 2010, a reconstituted version of the band, the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie, began performing live shows again.\n\n==History==\nThe band, originally a [[Surf music|surf rock]] group called The Crossfires, was formed in 1965 in [[Westchester, Los Angeles]] by high school friends Kaylan, Volman, [[Al Nichol]], [[Chuck Portz]], [[Don Murray (drummer)|Don Murray]], and Jim Tucker.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1196}}</ref> With the help of [[KRLA]] and [[KFWB]] [[DJ]] and club owner [[Reb Foster]] (born James Dennis Bruton, March 18, 1936 &ndash; August 25, 2019),<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/ \"Reb Foster, One of the 11-10 Men at KRLA, Dies\"], ''LA Radio'', August 26, 2019. Retrieved August 27, 2019</ref> The Crossfires signed to the newly formed [[White Whale Records]]. Adhering to the prevailing musical trend, they rebranded themselves as a [[folk rock]] group under the name The Tyrtles, an intentionally stylized misspelling inspired by [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beatles]]. However, the trendy spelling did not survive long.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAs with the Byrds, the Turtles achieved breakthrough success with a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\" reached the ''Billboard'' Top Ten in the late summer of 1965, and was the title track of the band's first album.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Their second single, \"Let Me Be,\" reached the top 30, while their third hit, \"You Baby,\" charted in the top 20 in early 1966.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band's second album, ''[[You Baby]],'' failed to reach ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s [[Billboard 200|Top LPs]] chart, and of several singles released in 1966, \"[[Grim Reaper of Love]]\" and \"Can I Get to Know You Better\" barely entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. One single, the tough \"Outside Chance\", written by [[Warren Zevon]] and featuring guitar work in the style of The Beatles' \"[[Taxman]]\", did not chart. In 1966, The Turtles made an appearance in [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s [[beach party film|beach party]] [[spy film|spy spoof]] film ''[[Out of Sight (1966 film)|Out of Sight]],'' singing \"She'll Come Back\" on screen.\n\nAt the start of 1966, drummer Don Murray and bassist Chuck Portz quit the group. They were replaced by [[Joel Larson]] and then [[John Barbata]] on drums, and by [[Chip Douglas]] on bass (October 1966).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe first of several key Turtles singles co-written by Garry Bonner and [[Alan Gordon (songwriter)|Alan Gordon]], \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\", had already been rejected by countless performers. \"Happy Together\", both their biggest hit and their signature song, signaled a turning point for both the Turtles and for Chip Douglas, who provided the arrangement.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The single replaced the Beatles' \"[[Penny Lane]]\" at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the spring of 1967. The Turtles' only No.&nbsp;1 remained there for three weeks. An album of the same name followed and peaked at No.&nbsp;25. \"Happy Together\" reached No. 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"betts\">{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Betts|year=2004|title=Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004|edition=1st|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=0-00-717931-6|page=802}}</ref> This same year saw the Turtles performing the title song (composed by [[John Williams]] with lyrics by [[Leslie Bricusse]]) for the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] [[bedroom farce]] ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]].''\n\nImpressed by Chip Douglas's studio arrangements, [[Michael Nesmith]] approached him after a Turtles show at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] and invited him to become [[The Monkees]]' new producer, as that band wanted to break out of their \"manufactured\" studio mold. Douglas accepted and left the Turtles, ultimately producing three Monkees albums: ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]''; ''[[Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.]]'' (both 1967) and co-produced ''[[The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees]]'' (1968). Douglas was replaced by [[Jim Pons]] on bass.\n\n1967 proved to be the Turtles' most successful year on the music charts. \"[[She'd Rather Be with Me]]\" reached No. 3 on the US charts in late spring and actually out-charted \"Happy Together\" overseas, reaching No. 4 in the UK.<ref name=\"betts\"/> Two successive Top 15 songs followed: \"[[You Know What I Mean]]\" and \"She's My Girl\". Both [[Gramophone Record|45]]s signaled a certain shift in the band's style. ''Golden Hits'' was released later that year, charting in the top 10. The similar album covers for ''The Turtles! Golden Hits'' and its follow up ''More Golden Hits'' were designed by [[Dean Torrence]] of [[Jan & Dean]].\n\nIn 1967, rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker left the band citing the pressure of touring and recording new material. He moved to Grass Valley where he became an electrical contractor. He has denied that he left the band because [[John Lennon]] was rude to him as suggested by the Turtles' lead singer Howard Kaylan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eterritorialdispatch.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/interview-with-turtle.html |title=eTerritorial Dispatch: Interview With A Turtle |website=Eterritorialdispatch.blogspot.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first two singles in 1968, \"Sound Asleep\" and \"The Story of Rock and Roll\", stalled somewhere in the middle of the top 100. The band's fortunes changed when Chip Douglas returned to work with them in the studio. Late in 1968 the band released a [[concept album]] called ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', in which the group pretended to be 11 different bands (with fanciful names including 'The Bigg Brothers', 'Nature's Children', 'the US Teens featuring Raoul', and 'the Fabulous Dawgs'), each with a song in a different genre. The album yielded two singles: \"[[Elenore]]\" and \"[[You Showed Me]]\" (both peaking at No.&nbsp;6). \"Elenore\" also reached No.&nbsp;7 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"betts\"/> The 1969 hit \"You Showed Me\" had been written by the Byrds' [[Gene Clark]] and [[Roger McGuinn|Roger (then Jim) McGuinn]] in 1964. Television appearances included a February 1968 spot on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', to which they returned in April 1969.\n\nTowards the end of 1969, the group released its next album, ''[[Turtle Soup]]'', a critically well-received LP produced by [[Ray Davies]] of [[the Kinks]]. Inspired by the revered 1968 concept album ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'', this was Davies's only released production work for another band (although Davies had previously produced demo recordings for [[Badfinger|The Iveys]]). Notable tracks include \"Somewhere Friday Nite\" and \"Love in the City\". In spite of ''Turtle Soup''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s positive reception from the music press, its commercial success was marginal and the band soon began to disintegrate.\n\nLong disillusioned with their record label and its growing financial problems by this time, Kaylan and Volman resisted White Whale's efforts to turn the Turtles into something approaching an assembly-line pop act. The label apparently encouraged Kaylan and Volman to fire the rest of the band, tour with hired musicians and make records by adding their vocals to backing tracks recorded by Memphis session players. Such pressure convinced the band to record a single called \"Who Would Ever Think That I Would Ever Marry Margaret?\", which they disowned after its release.\n\nThe Turtles wound down their career in 1970 with a second compilation album, ''More Golden Hits'', and a [[B-sides]] and rarities album, ''[[Wooden Head]]''. With the demise of the Turtles, White Whale Records was left with few commercially viable bands, and soon ceased operation.\n\n===Post-Turtles===\nKaylan and Volman (accompanied by Chip Douglas' replacement, bassist Jim Pons) joined [[the Mothers of Invention]]<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> as The Phlorescent Leech & Eddie, since the use of the Turtles name (and even their own names in billings) was prohibited by their contract with White Whale.

M. Standifer Construction Company|Guy M. Standifer Construction Company]] of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] for the [[United States Shipping Board]] as part of the wartime shipbuilding program of the [[Emergency Fleet Corporation]] (EFC) to restore the nation's Merchant Marine. The vessel was largely employed on the East Coast of the United States to Australia route until 1928 when she was laid up. In late 1937 the ship together with several other vessels was bid on and subsequently acquired next year by the Greek tramp operator John D. Chandris to carry cargo from Australia to Greece and United Kingdom. The freighter was also renamed '''''Adelfoi Chandris'''''. Following the surrender of France, the ship was interned in Dakar and passed into Vichy government hands in 1940 and renamed '''''Saint Marin'''''. Under the terms of Nevers Agreement she eventually was transferred to Italy and renamed '''''Catania'''''. In early August 1943 the vessel together with several other ships was bombed and damaged in [[Naples]] harbor by the Allied aircraft.\n\n==Design and construction==\nAfter the United States entry into [[World War I]], a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB.\n\n''Cokesit'' was part of the order for 10 vessels placed by USSB with Guy M. Standifer Construction Co. on 8 January 1918 and was laid down on 3 August 1918 and launched on 31 December 1918 (yard number 1), with Miss Ruth Standifer, sister of Guy M. Standifer, principal owner of the G. M. Standifer Construction Co., being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=2217776|shipname=Cokesit|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Oregon Daily Journal]] |date=1 January 1919 |page=15 |title=9500-Ton Vessel Is Launched From Vancouver Ways. |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34072596/the_oregon_daily_journal/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=20 July 2019}}{{free access}}</ref> Due to the ship being the first vessel launched by a newly established yard, there was a large crowd in attendance consisting of common folk and local dignitaries. Just as with many other vessels being built for the Shipping Board, her name was picked by [[Edith Wilson|Mrs. Woodrow Wilson]] who often chose Native American words for naming purposes.\n\nThe ship had two main decks as well as [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]] and was built on the [[Joseph Isherwood|Isherwood]] principle of [[longitudinal framing]] providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The freighter had five main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five large hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. She was also equipped with wireless apparatus, had submarine signal system installed and had electrical lights installed along the decks.\n\nAs built, the ship was {{convert|401|ft|4|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]) and {{convert|53|ft|2|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], a depth of {{convert|31|ft|9|in|m}}.<ref name=uslist>{{cite book |year=1927-1928 |title=Merchant Vessels of the United States |location=Washington, DC |publisher=United States Printing Office}}</ref> ''Cokesit'' was originally assessed at {{GRT|6176}} and {{NRT|4401}} and had [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] of approximately 9,627.<ref name=hr2>{{cite book |title=Register of Ships Owned by United States Shipping Board |date=August 1, 1920  |url=http://www.shipscribe.com/shiprefs/USSB_1920/pages2/Cokesit%20-%20Coperas.html |location=Washington, DC |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |page=19}}</ref><ref name=uslist/> The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single 2,800 [[ihp]] [[triple expansion steam engine]], with cylinders of {{convert|24+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|41+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}} and {{convert|72|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter with a {{convert|48|in|cm|adj=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]], that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to {{convert|11|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=uslist/><ref name=lloyds>{{cite web |url=https://plimsoll.southampton.gov.uk/shipdata/pdfs/33/33b0214.pdf |year=1933 |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamships and Motorships |location=London |publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]]}}</ref> The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel.\n\nThe sea trials were held on the [[Columbia River]] on 16 April 1919 during which the ship could easily maintain an average speed of {{convert|11+1/2|kn|mph km/h}} on several runs over a measured distance, half a knot above her contract speed.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Oregon Daily Journal]] |date=17 April 1919 |page=22 |title=Test Trip Wins High Praise. |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34072739/the_oregon_daily_journal/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=20 July 2019}}{{free access}}</ref> Following their successful completion, the ship was turned over to the USSB two weeks later.\n\n==Operational history==\nWhile the steamer was still under construction she was allocated by the USSB to [[Pacific Steamship Company]] to transport flour to the East Coast for delivery to Europe.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Oregon Daily Journal]] |date=20 April 1919 |page=22 |title=Pacific Co.

M. Standifer Construction Company|Guy M. Standifer Construction Company]] of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] for the [[United States Shipping Board]] as part of the wartime shipbuilding program of the [[Emergency Fleet Corporation]] (EFC) to restore the nation's Merchant Marine. The vessel was largely employed on the East Coast of the United States to Australia route until 1928 when she was laid up. In late 1937 the ship together with several other vessels was bid on and subsequently acquired next year by the Greek tramp operator John D. Chandris to carry cargo from Australia to Greece and United Kingdom. The freighter was also renamed '''''Adelfoi Chandris'''''. Following the surrender of France, the ship was interned in Dakar and passed into Vichy government hands in 1940 and renamed '''''Saint Marin'''''. Under the terms of Nevers Agreement she eventually was transferred to Italy and renamed '''''Catania'''''. In early August 1943 the vessel together with several other ships was bombed and damaged in [[Naples]] harbor by the Allied aircraft.\n\n==Design and construction==\nAfter the United States entry into [[World War I]], a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB.\n\n''Cokesit'' was part of the order for 10 vessels placed by USSB with Guy M. Standifer Construction Co. on 8 January 1918 and was laid down on 3 August 1918 and launched on 31 December 1918 (yard number 1), with Miss Ruth Standifer, sister of Guy M. Standifer, principal owner of the G. M.

On 23 October 1942 ''Saint Marin'' was restored to their former Greek owners under her original name and simultaneously transferred to [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and put under control of Societ\u00e0 Anonima di Navigazione Italia under a name ''Catania''. On 12 November 1942 the vessel was requisitioned by [[Regia Marina]] and remained in their service until 3 March 1943 when the ship charter was annulled. The vessel subsequently was chartered by [[Regio Esercito]] and remained under their control until the end of her career. On 4 August 1943 she was heavily damaged during an [[Bombing of Naples in World War II|Allied air raid]] on Naples. She was further damaged during another air raid on 8 September 1943, and was finally scuttled by the retreating German troops on 15 September 1943 a few days before arrival of Allies in [[Naples]]. After the end of the World War II the ship was raised and Italy was allowed to scrap the wreckage in 1949.<ref name=fm/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{August 1943 shipwrecks}}\n{{Design 1015 ships}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cokesit}}\n[[Category:1918 ships]]\n[[Category:Design 1015 ships]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the United States]]\n[[Category:Steamships of the United States]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of Greece]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in August 1943]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "miscapitalization (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Cokesit"}
