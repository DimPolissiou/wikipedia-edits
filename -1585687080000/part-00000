Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to solitary parathyroid adenoma. Less commonly it may be due to double parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia. Tc99 sestamibi scan of head, neck and upper thorax is the most commonly used test for localizing parathyroid adenomas having a sensitivity and specificity of 70\u201380%. Sensitivity falls down to 30% in case of double/multiple parathyroid adenomas or in case of parathyroid hyperplasia. Ultrasonography is also a useful test in localizing suspicious parathyroid lesions.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment is usually surgical removal of the gland(s) containing adenomas, but medication may also be required.\n\n===Surgery===\nThe surgical removal of one or more of the parathyroid glands is known as a parathyroidectomy; this operation was first performed in 1925.<ref name=\"pmid?\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber T, Eberle J, Messelh\u00e4user U |title=Parathyroidectomy, elevated depression scores, and suicidal ideation in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: results of a prospective multicenter study| journal=JAMA Surg. |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=109\u2013115 |year=2013 |doi=10.1001/2013.jamasurg.316|pmid=23560281|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The symptoms of the disease, listed above, are indications for surgery.

However, cardiovascular mortality is not significantly reduced.<ref name=\"Vestergaard2003\" />\n\nThe 2002 NIH Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism developed criteria for surgical intervention . The criteria were revised at the Third International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism . These criteria were chosen on the basis of clinical experience and observational and clinical trial data as to which patients are more likely to have end-organ effects of primary hyperparathyroidism (nephrolithiasis, skeletal involvement), disease progression if surgery is deferred, and the most benefit from surgery. The panel emphasized the need for parathyroidectomy to be performed by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation. The Third International Workshop guidelines concluded that surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients who meet any one of the following conditions:\n\n* Serum calcium concentration of 1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.25&nbsp;mmol/L) or more above the upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine clearance that is reduced to <60 mL/min\n* Bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (T score <-2.5) and/or previous fragility fracture\n* Age less than 50 years\n\nOperative intervention can be delayed in patients over 50 years of age who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and who have serum calcium concentrations <1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.2&nbsp;mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal, and in patients who are medically unfit for surgery\n\nMore recently, three [[randomized controlled trial]]s have studied the role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism.

Pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism can be distinguished by its more severe manifestations, in contrast to the less intense manifestations in adult primary hyperparathyroidism. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is more likely to be associated with childhood and adolescent primary hyperparathyroidism. The fundamental  skeletal radiologic manifestation include diffuse osteopenia, pathologic fractures and the coexistence of resorption and sclerosis at numerous sites. Skeletal lesions can be specifically bilateral, symmetric and multifocal, exhibiting different types of bone resorption. Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck and spine can potentially initiate serious complications. Because pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism is frequently associated with pathologic fractures it can be misdiagnosed as osteogenesis imperfecta. Pediatric patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are best remedied by parathyroidectomy. Early diagnosis of pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism is all-important to minimize disease complications and start off timely and relevant treatment.<ref>\u2022\tEL-Sobky TA, Ahmad KA, Samir S, EL Mikkawy DME (2016).

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to solitary parathyroid adenoma. Less commonly it may be due to double parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia. Tc99 sestamibi scan of head, neck and upper thorax is the most commonly used test for localizing parathyroid adenomas having a sensitivity and specificity of 70\u201380%. Sensitivity falls down to 30% in case of double/multiple parathyroid adenomas or in case of parathyroid hyperplasia.

The criteria were revised at the Third International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism . These criteria were chosen on the basis of clinical experience and observational and clinical trial data as to which patients are more likely to have end-organ effects of primary hyperparathyroidism (nephrolithiasis, skeletal involvement), disease progression if surgery is deferred, and the most benefit from surgery. The panel emphasized the need for parathyroidectomy to be performed by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation. The Third International Workshop guidelines concluded that surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients who meet any one of the following conditions:\n\n* Serum calcium concentration of 1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.25&nbsp;mmol/L) or more above the upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine clearance that is reduced to <60 mL/min\n* Bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (T score <-2.5) and/or previous fragility fracture\n* Age less than 50 years\n\nOperative intervention can be delayed in patients over 50 years of age who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and who have serum calcium concentrations <1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.2&nbsp;mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal, and in patients who are medically unfit for surgery\n\nMore recently, three [[randomized controlled trial]]s have studied the role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism.

Pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism can be distinguished by its more severe manifestations, in contrast to the less intense manifestations in adult primary hyperparathyroidism. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is more likely to be associated with childhood and adolescent primary hyperparathyroidism. The fundamental  skeletal radiologic manifestation include diffuse osteopenia, pathologic fractures and the coexistence of resorption and sclerosis at numerous sites. Skeletal lesions can be specifically bilateral, symmetric and multifocal, exhibiting different types of bone resorption. Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck and spine can potentially initiate serious complications. Because pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism is frequently associated with pathologic fractures it can be misdiagnosed as osteogenesis imperfecta. Pediatric patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are best remedied by parathyroidectomy. Early diagnosis of pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism is all-important to minimize disease complications and start off timely and relevant treatment.<ref>\u2022\tEL-Sobky TA, Ahmad KA, Samir S, EL Mikkawy DME (2016).

The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.\n\nAll tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the drag. When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a \"full pull\". When more than one [[tractor]] completes the course, more weight is added to the drag, and those competitors that moved past {{convert|300|ft|disp=flip}} will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the drag the farthest.\n\nThe drag is known as a ''weight transfer drag''. This means that, as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the drag\u2019s wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the drag. In front of the rear wheels, instead of front wheels, there is a \"pan\". This is essentially a metal plate, and as the weight moves toward it, the resistance between the pan and the ground builds. The farther the tractor pulls the drag, the more difficult it gets.\n\nThe most powerful tractors, such as those in the heavy modified class in Europe, can produce over {{convert|12000|PS|disp=flip}}.\n\n{{anchor|History in the USA}}\n\n==History in the US==\nPrior to the invention of the tractor, when [[farm implement]]s were pulled by [[horse]]s, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases, they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay [[cart]] or [[wagon]]. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would urge his horses to pull the load, with more weight added as competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of [[horse pulling]], which is still carried out today with [[draft horses]], specially bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on drags are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term [[horsepower]] is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by [[James Watt]] and [[Mason Worrell]].\n\nIt wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at [[Vaughansville, Missouri]], and [[Bowling Green, Ohio]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/machines_09.html|title=Tractor Pulling during the 1950s and 60s|website=livinghistoryfarm.org|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from [[U.S. state|state]] to state, [[County (United States)|county]] to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants.\n\nIn 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the [[National Tractor Pullers Association]] (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it.\n\nTractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the [[Transmission (mechanics)|crossbox]] which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single [[driveshaft]]. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered \"Makin Bacon Special\", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the \"Mission Impossible\" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven [[supercharger|blown]] [[Methanol fuel|alcohol]] engines on board.\n\nSubsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large [[turbochargers]], along with [[intercooler]]s, but both retained the appearance of a [[tractor]]. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\" motto obsolete.\n\nThroughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' [[drag racing|dragster]]s. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as [[piston engines]], [[Turboshaft|turbine engines]] (frequently mistakenly called \"[[Jet engine|jet engines]]\") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's \"General\" Tractor a four-[[turboshaft]] unit hitting the hook in 1989.\n\nThe growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new [[four-wheel drive]] [[Division (sport)|division]] in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from {{convert|450|cuin|disp=flip}} up to {{convert|700|cuin|disp=flip}} and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to {{convert|650|cuin|disp=flip}} [[naturally aspirated]] and no [[supercharger|blown engine]] in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers \"4-Play\" Chevy and Bob Boden's \"Studley Studebaker\".\n\n===Two-wheel-drive (2WD) truck class===\nThe [[two-wheel drive]] (2WD) division was introduced in 1983.\n\nThe division imposes a weight-limit of {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} on each competing truck, a maximum width of {{convert|8|ft|disp=flip}}, and a maximum distance of {{convert|15|ft||disp=flip}} from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to {{convert|10|in|disp=flip}} of cosmetic fiberglass, however.)\n\nAlcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted.\n\nThe National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to {{convert|575|cuin|disp=flip|abbr=on}} and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is {{convert|18.4|x|16.1|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, with a maximum circumference of {{convert|143|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}} when mounted on an {{convert|18|in|adj=on|disp=flip}} rim and inflated to {{convert|28|psi|disp=flip}}. The ground patch is not to exceed {{convert|19|in|disp=flip}} on original tread.<ref>2010 Pulling Rules, National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA), A division of World Pulling International, Inc. (WPI)</ref>\n\n===Super stock, pro-stock, and mini-modified===\nSuper Stock tractor Open class uses primarily methanol fuel (some are diesel versions). The Super Stock Open machines can generate over {{convert|6000|PS|disp=flip}} an {{convert|4000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque, with billet or re-cast engine blocks. Super Stock Open and Super Stock Diesel tractors may use up to four turbochargers in three stages. The Diesel super stock tractors generate close to {{convert|5000|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|6000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque and are allowed to compete in the Open class, which very rarely occurs anymore. However, a true Open (methanol fuel) tractor is not allowed to compete in the Diesel class.\n\nThere is light Super Stock class which is {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} and the Heavy Super Stock Classes that are {{convert|8000|-|8250|lb|disp=flip}}.\n\nDiesel Pro Stock Tractors are limited to one turbocharger and diesel fuel is the only allowable source for power, in keeping with the 'spirit' of the original tractors. The maximum engine displacement is {{convert|680|cuin|disp=flip}}.  These engines can achieve around {{convert|3700|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|5500|lbfft|disp=flip}} of tourqe<ref>http://www.ntpapull.com/Gregg's%20Releases/St.%20Hyacinthe%202006.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In recent years, new classes have been created to appeal to different groups of pullers. There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to {{convert|640|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and {{convert|4.1|in|disp=flip}} turbocharger. This class typically pulls at {{convert|9300|-|9500|lb|disp=flip}} and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to {{convert|680|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and an unrestricted size [[turbocharger]], along with intercoolers.\n\nThe latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls {{convert|8300|-|8600|lb|disp=flip}} depending on location. These tractors are limited to {{convert|540|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of {{convert|2500|-|2800|PS|disp=flip}}. The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track.\n\nThe mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to {{convert|575|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weight only {{convert|2050|lb|disp=flip}}. Today's engine is capable of a minimum of {{convert|2500|PS|disp=flip}} on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh {{convert|6000|,|7500|and|8000|lb|disp=flip}}, utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the {{convert|8000|lb|disp=flip}} weight limit.  [[Nitromethane]] and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.\n\n== Antique Tractor Pulling ==\nAntique tractor pulling is how tractor pulling first got started. As early as 1929, farmers began attaching their tractors to drags, and dragging it down a field to see who could pull it the furthest <ref name=\":1\" />. People who were event organizers at Bowling Green, Missouri and Vaughansville, Ohio found out farmers were doing this and that it drew spectators<ref name=\":1\" />. By 1950, county fairs across the country started featuring tractor pulls<ref name=\":1\" />. Spectators found it fascinating to see machines that would \u201cPull on Sunday, plow on Monday\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />. At first competitors would use a \u2018Human Drag\u2019, meaning a drag that was weighted by humans, different people would be added as the tractor made it down the track. However, organizers began to look at different ways to add weight to the drag, as spectators walking on the drag while moving proved to be a hazard <ref name=\":1\" />. In the late 60s, a weight-exchanging drag was created, the drag that was created was basically a flatbed truck trailer with wheels near the back and a drag at the front <ref name=\":1\" />. A mass that is moveable of up to 65,000 pounds or 29,000 kilograms, the mass starts at the back of the sled, slowly working its way up to the top as the drag moves down the track <ref name=\":1\" />. \n\nThe tractors are divided into different weight classes based on the tractor weight, the weight classes starting at 2500 and ending at 14000 pounds. The tractors could go in any class they choose, a lot of tractors will weight their tractors up, so they fit into the higher weighted classes. In order to be able to compete in Antique tractor pull competitions your tractor must have the original speed the tractor is supposed to have. Some pulling competitions will have a \u2018dyno\u2019 so you can \u2018dyno\u2019 your tractor, which means hooking up the PTO shaft on your tractor to the machine to test the horsepower. If your tractor shows it has more horse power than the original tractor is supposed to have, you get put into an alternate class called \u2018Modified Tractors\u2019. They do this to avoid the tractors that have been modified always winning, they want a fair competition.   \n\nMost antique tractors when pulling needs about 14-15 pounds in their tires, however it could be more or less depending on the rules of the competition you are entering. There is also a drawbar rule, it is to be a minimum of two square inches in total steel at any point, as well must be rigid in all directions<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.peitruckandtractorpull.com/rules|title=PEI Truck & Tractor Pull Championships|website=www.peitruckandtractorpull.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. The hitching device can be no more than 1 1/2 inch round stock (1 1/2 square), or less than 1 1/8 inch round stock (1 inch square), the hole has to be 3\"X3 3/4\"- inch diameter<ref name=\":2\" />.

The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.\n\nAll tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the drag. When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a \"full pull\". When more than one [[tractor]] completes the course, more weight is added to the drag, and those competitors that moved past {{convert|300|ft|disp=flip}} will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the drag the farthest.\n\nThe drag is known as a ''weight transfer drag''. This means that, as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the drag\u2019s wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the drag. In front of the rear wheels, instead of front wheels, there is a \"pan\". This is essentially a metal plate, and as the weight moves toward it, the resistance between the pan and the ground builds. The farther the tractor pulls the drag, the more difficult it gets.\n\nThe most powerful tractors, such as those in the heavy modified class in Europe, can produce over {{convert|12000|PS|disp=flip}}.\n\n{{anchor|History in the USA}}\n\n==History in the US==\nPrior to the invention of the tractor, when [[farm implement]]s were pulled by [[horse]]s, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases, they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay [[cart]] or [[wagon]]. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would urge his horses to pull the load, with more weight added as competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of [[horse pulling]], which is still carried out today with [[draft horses]], specially bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on drags are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term [[horsepower]] is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by [[James Watt]] and [[Mason Worrell]].\n\nIt wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at [[Vaughansville, Missouri]], and [[Bowling Green, Ohio]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/machines_09.html|title=Tractor Pulling during the 1950s and 60s|website=livinghistoryfarm.org|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from [[U.S. state|state]] to state, [[County (United States)|county]] to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants.\n\nIn 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the [[National Tractor Pullers Association]] (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it.\n\nTractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the [[Transmission (mechanics)|crossbox]] which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single [[driveshaft]]. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered \"Makin Bacon Special\", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the \"Mission Impossible\" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven [[supercharger|blown]] [[Methanol fuel|alcohol]] engines on board.\n\nSubsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large [[turbochargers]], along with [[intercooler]]s, but both retained the appearance of a [[tractor]]. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\" motto obsolete.\n\nThroughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' [[drag racing|dragster]]s. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as [[piston engines]], [[Turboshaft|turbine engines]] (frequently mistakenly called \"[[Jet engine|jet engines]]\") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's \"General\" Tractor a four-[[turboshaft]] unit hitting the hook in 1989.\n\nThe growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new [[four-wheel drive]] [[Division (sport)|division]] in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from {{convert|450|cuin|disp=flip}} up to {{convert|700|cuin|disp=flip}} and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to {{convert|650|cuin|disp=flip}} [[naturally aspirated]] and no [[supercharger|blown engine]] in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers \"4-Play\" Chevy and Bob Boden's \"Studley Studebaker\".\n\n===Two-wheel-drive (2WD) truck class===\nThe [[two-wheel drive]] (2WD) division was introduced in 1983.\n\nThe division imposes a weight-limit of {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} on each competing truck, a maximum width of {{convert|8|ft|disp=flip}}, and a maximum distance of {{convert|15|ft||disp=flip}} from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to {{convert|10|in|disp=flip}} of cosmetic fiberglass, however.)\n\nAlcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted.\n\nThe National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to {{convert|575|cuin|disp=flip|abbr=on}} and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is {{convert|18.4|x|16.1|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, with a maximum circumference of {{convert|143|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}} when mounted on an {{convert|18|in|adj=on|disp=flip}} rim and inflated to {{convert|28|psi|disp=flip}}. The ground patch is not to exceed {{convert|19|in|disp=flip}} on original tread.<ref>2010 Pulling Rules, National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA), A division of World Pulling International, Inc. (WPI)</ref>\n\n===Super stock, pro-stock, and mini-modified===\nSuper Stock tractor Open class uses primarily methanol fuel (some are diesel versions). The Super Stock Open machines can generate over {{convert|6000|PS|disp=flip}} an {{convert|4000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque, with billet or re-cast engine blocks. Super Stock Open and Super Stock Diesel tractors may use up to four turbochargers in three stages. The Diesel super stock tractors generate close to {{convert|5000|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|6000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque and are allowed to compete in the Open class, which very rarely occurs anymore. However, a true Open (methanol fuel) tractor is not allowed to compete in the Diesel class.\n\nThere is light Super Stock class which is {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} and the Heavy Super Stock Classes that are {{convert|8000|-|8250|lb|disp=flip}}.\n\nDiesel Pro Stock Tractors are limited to one turbocharger and diesel fuel is the only allowable source for power, in keeping with the 'spirit' of the original tractors. The maximum engine displacement is {{convert|680|cuin|disp=flip}}.  These engines can achieve around {{convert|3700|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|5500|lbfft|disp=flip}} of tourqe<ref>http://www.ntpapull.com/Gregg's%20Releases/St.%20Hyacinthe%202006.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In recent years, new classes have been created to appeal to different groups of pullers. There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to {{convert|640|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and {{convert|4.1|in|disp=flip}} turbocharger. This class typically pulls at {{convert|9300|-|9500|lb|disp=flip}} and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to {{convert|680|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and an unrestricted size [[turbocharger]], along with intercoolers.\n\nThe latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls {{convert|8300|-|8600|lb|disp=flip}} depending on location. These tractors are limited to {{convert|540|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of {{convert|2500|-|2800|PS|disp=flip}}. The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track.\n\nThe mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to {{convert|575|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weight only {{convert|2050|lb|disp=flip}}. Today's engine is capable of a minimum of {{convert|2500|PS|disp=flip}} on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh {{convert|6000|,|7500|and|8000|lb|disp=flip}}, utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the {{convert|8000|lb|disp=flip}} weight limit.  [[Nitromethane]] and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.\n\n== Antique Tractor Pulling ==\nAntique tractor pulling is how tractor pulling first got started. As early as 1929, farmers began attaching their tractors to drags, and dragging it down a field to see who could pull it the furthest <ref name=\":1\" />. People who were event organizers at Bowling Green, Missouri and Vaughansville, Ohio found out farmers were doing this and that it drew spectators<ref name=\":1\" />. By 1950, county fairs across the country started featuring tractor pulls<ref name=\":1\" />. Spectators found it fascinating to see machines that would \u201cPull on Sunday, plow on Monday\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />. At first competitors would use a \u2018Human Drag\u2019, meaning a drag that was weighted by humans, different people would be added as the tractor made it down the track. However, organizers began to look at different ways to add weight to the drag, as spectators walking on the drag while moving proved to be a hazard <ref name=\":1\" />. In the late 60s, a weight-exchanging drag was created, the drag that was created was basically a flatbed truck trailer with wheels near the back and a drag at the front <ref name=\":1\" />. A mass that is moveable of up to 65,000 pounds or 29,000 kilograms, the mass starts at the back of the sled, slowly working its way up to the top as the drag moves down the track <ref name=\":1\" />. \n\nThe tractors are divided into different weight classes based on the tractor weight, the weight classes starting at 2500 and ending at 14000 pounds. The tractors could go in any class they choose, a lot of tractors will weight their tractors up, so they fit into the higher weighted classes. In order to be able to compete in Antique tractor pull competitions your tractor must have the original speed the tractor is supposed to have. Some pulling competitions will have a \u2018dyno\u2019 so you can \u2018dyno\u2019 your tractor, which means hooking up the PTO shaft on your tractor to the machine to test the horsepower. If your tractor shows it has more horse power than the original tractor is supposed to have, you get put into an alternate class called \u2018Modified Tractors\u2019. They do this to avoid the tractors that have been modified always winning, they want a fair competition. Most antique tractors when pulling needs about 14-15 pounds in their tires, however it could be more or less depending on the rules of the competition you are entering. There is also a drawbar rule, it is to be a minimum of two square inches in total steel at any point, as well must be rigid in all directions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peitruckandtractorpull.com/rules|title=PEI Truck & Tractor Pull Championships|website=www.peitruckandtractorpull.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>.  \n\n==History in Australia==\n\n[[File:Sheffield Tractor Pull.JPG|thumb|right|Tractor pull at [[Sheffield, Tasmania]]]]\nThe first Australian Tractor Pull was held at the Elmore Field Days (Victoria) in 1976.

Monk composed the tune throughout May 1957. The tune was originally titled \"Twilight with Nellie\", but [[Pannonica de Koenigswarter]] suggested instead to use the [[French language|French]] word for twilight, which is ''crepuscule''. The tune was first recorded with Monk's septet for ''[[Monk's Music]]''; on that album (and on many of its reissues), \"Crepuscule\" was spelled \"Crepescule\" (3 ''e'''s, 1 ''u''). {{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=221-223}} The tune also appears on ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses (film)#Musical score and soundtrack|Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=271}} ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]''.,{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=335}} and on the live albums from [[Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall|Carnegie Hall]], [[The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall|Town Hall]],{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=258-259}} [[Monk in France|France]] and [[Thelonious Monk in Italy|Italy]].\n\n===Criss-Cross===\n\"Criss-Cross\" (originally titled \"Sailor Cap\"){{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=154-155}} was one Monk's very first compositions, he wrote early in 1944 as response to a collaborative project between Monk, [[Mary Lou Williams]], and [[Bud Powell]].{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=93}} It was first recorded July 23, 1951, for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions, and was later featured on the 1964 [[Criss-Cross (album)|album of the same name]].{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=332}} On the first version, the tune is in a standard 32-bar AABA-form, but in the last version, the two last bars of the B-section are dropped.<ref name=\"iverson\" />\n\nThe tune inspired [[Gunther Schuller]] to compose variations on ''Criss-Cross'', which premiered May 17, 1960, and was later released on ''[[Jazz Abstractions]]'', featuring [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Eric Dolphy]] as soloists.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=288-289}}\n\n\n==E==\n===Epistrophy===\n\"Epistrophy\" (initially called \"Fly Rite\" or \"[[Iambic pentameter]]\") was co-written with [[Kenny Clarke]], and was copyrighted June 2, 1941, and was the first tune copyrighted by Monk. It is a relatively atonal 32-bar tune in ABCB-form, though the key center is C{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThe main melodic theme was composed by Clarke, after experimenting with fingerings on the ukulele, and the chords where written by Monk. The title \"Epistrophy\" is not a word in any dictionary. However, the word \"[[epistrophe]]\" is defined by [[Merriam-Webster]] as \"the repetition of a word or expression at the end of successive phrases, clauses, sentences, or verses especially for rhetorical or poetic effect\".\n\nThe tune appears on almost every single live album by Monk, as it was the closing tune of each set from Monk's days at [[Minton's Playhouse]] onwards.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=69-70}} The first recording was by [[Cootie Williams]] on April 1, 1942,{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=76-77}} and it was later recorded by Clarke's band September 5, 1946.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.discogs.com/Kenny-Clark-And-His-52nd-Street-Boy-Epistrophy-Oop-Bop-ShBam/release/5336773\n |title=Kenny Clark And His 52nd Street Boys \u2013 Epistrophy / Oop Bop Sh'Bam\n |website=[[discogs]].com\n |access-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref> It was not recorded by Monk before July 2, 1948 for the ''[[Wizard of the Vibes]]'' sessions, featuring [[Milt Jackson]].{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=140-141}} It was later recorded for ''[[Monk's Music]]''{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=221-223}} and was an outtake from the ''[[It's Monk's Time]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=350-351}}\n\n===Eronel===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form originally composed by [[Sadik Hakim]], co-written with [[Idrees Sulieman]]. It was recorded July 23, 1951 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions. However, Monk repeatedly changed notes and the chords to the tune and added the B-section, eventually making it \"his\" tune. Hakim originally wrote the tune in dedication to an old flame of Hakim, Lenore Gordon (''Eronel'' is ''Lenore'' backwards). When the recording was released, it was only credited to Monk - Hakim and Sulieman didn't receive the composer's credit until Monk's death.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=154-155}} It later appeared on ''[[Piano Solo (Thelonious Monk album)|Piano Solo]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=177}} and on ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=332}}\n\n===Evidence===\nA contrafact of \"[[Just You, Just Me]]\".

It was first recorded by [[Gigi Gryce]] with Monk as a sideman on October 15, 1955 for Gryce's album ''[[Nica's Tempo]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=193-194}} and later appears on ''[[It's Monk's Time]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=357}}\n\n===Sixteen===\nA 16-bar tune in AABA-form, and the title is from the tune's number of bars. Its only recording was done May 30, 1952, for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions, but was not released officially until [[Mosaic Records]] released their compilation of Monk's [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=158}}\n\n===Skippy===\nA 32-bar tune in ABAC-form, and is based entirely on cycling dominant chords (or their [[tritone substitution]]s). The tune's tonality is completely hidden until the last 4 bars clearly establish A{{music|flat}}-major. The tune was named after Nellie Monk's sister, whose real name was Evelyn.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=33}} Its only recording was done May 30, 1952, for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions,{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=158}} but has since the 2000s became a popular tune, with many cover versions. It is commonly agreed that the \"Skippy\"'s changes are based on Monk's reharmonization of \"[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]\" (which he would later record on [[The Unique Thelonious Monk]],{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=205}} and on ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=332}}) but [[Ethan Iverson]] argues that Monk composed \"Skippy\", then applied the changes to \"Tea for Two\".<ref name=\"iverson\" />\n\n===Something in Blue===\nA 12-bar blues in B{{music|b}}. It was only recorded once, at the marathon [[Black Lion Records]] session of November 15, 1971.{{sfn|Sheridan|2001|}}\n\n===Straight, No Chaser===\nA [[12-bar blues]] in B{{music|b}} which, as in \"[[Blue Monk]]\", makes creative use of chromatics in the melody. It was first recorded July 23, 1951 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions,{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=154-155}} and later appears on ''[[Mulligan Meets Monk]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=235-236}} ''[[5 by Monk by 5]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=268-269}} ''[[Straight, No Chaser (Thelonious Monk album)|Straight, No Chaser]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=384-385}} and on ''[[Monk's Blues]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=400-403}} Live versions appear on the albums recorded in [[Thelonious Monk in Italy|Italy]], [[Monk in Tokyo|Tokyo]], [[Live at the It Club|It Club]] and at the [[Live at the Jazz Workshop|Jazz Workshop]].\n\nMiles Davis recorded a version on his ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' album, in which the tune is played in F rather than B{{music|b}}.

For copyright reasons, the song was renamed \"Get It Straight\".\n\nMusic educator Mark C.

The A-section is based on [[rhythm changes]], and is borrowed from [[Coleman Hawkins]]'s tune \"Stuffy\".{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=350-351}}\n\n==T==\n===Teo===\nA 24-bar tune in B{{music|b}} minor in ABA-form. \"Teo\" was written as a tribute to Monk's, and many other of Columbia's jazz musicians', producer, [[Teo Macero]]. The changes are based on the standard \"[[Topsy (instrumental)|Topsy]]\".{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=350-351}} The tune was first recorded March 9, 1964, and first appeared on the album ''[[Monk (1964 album)|Monk]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=357}}\n\n===Thelonious===\nA 36-bar tune in AABA-form (8-10-8-10) in B{{music|b}} major. The tune was first recorded October 15, 1947 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=127-128}} It was later recorded for the album ''[[Underground (Thelonious Monk album)|Underground]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=393-394}} and live versions appear on the albums ''[[The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=258-259}} and ''[[Live at the Jazz Workshop]]''.\n\nThe A-section is based on a riff that Monk used very often, dating back to his days as the house pianist at [[Minton's Playhouse]]. The riff contains only the pitches B{{music|b}} and A, insisting on the tonic, and is reharmonized with descending chords.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=127-128}}\n\n===Think of One===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form. The tune was first recorded November 13, 1953 and appears on the album ''[[Monk (1954 album)|Monk]]'', and later appears on the album ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]''. The tune is very similar in conception to \"Thelonious\", as the melody insists the tonic, with albeit more unexpected changes than in \"Thelonious\".{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=164-165}}\n\n===Trinkle, Tinkle===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form that is notorious for its difficult melody. It was first recorded December 18, 1952 for the album ''[[Thelonious Monk Trio]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=159-161}} and later appears on the album ''[[Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane]]'' and on ''[[Monk's Blues]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=400-403}}\n\nThere are two stories about the origin of the title, the first explains that producer [[Ira Gitler]] may have misheard when Monk said the title of the tune in studio - Gitler reports that Monk may have said \"Trinkle, Tinkle, like a star\" instead of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, like a star\". It is also believed that the title is a corruption of the term \"tickler\", which was what the old [[stride (music)|stride]] pianists used to call themselves.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=159-161}}\n\n===Two Timer===\nA tune that was never recorded by Monk, but was first recorded by [[Jackie McLean]] for his album ''[[A Fickle Sonance]]'', under the title \"Five Will Get You Ten\". The tune was credited to [[Sonny Clark]], who was struggling with [[heroin]] addiction at the time, and was a frequent visitor to Monk's friend, [[Pannonica de Koenigswarter]]'s house. It is believed that since Monk kept most of his sheet music in Pannonica's house, Clark stole the lead sheet and claimed as his own, in hopes of the tune being a hit.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=311}} The original lead sheet was later discovered around the '90s, and was first recorded by [[T. S. Monk|Monk's son]] for his album ''Monk on Monk''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=563-569}}\n\n==U==\n===Ugly Beauty===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form, and was only recorded once, on December 21, 1967, for the album ''[[Underground (Thelonious Monk album)|Underground]]''. It was Monk's drummer [[Ben Riley]] suggestion to play the tune as a waltz, and \"Ugly Beauty\" is therefore significant for being Monk's only waltz.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=393-394}} Mike Ferro later wrote lyrics to the tune, and the song was recorded in 1988 by [[Carmen McRae]] as part of her studio album ''[[Carmen Sings Monk]]''. For copyright reasons, the song was renamed \"Still We Dream\".\n\n==W==\n===We See===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form, and was first recorded May 11, 1954 for the album ''[[Monk (1954 album)|Monk]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=167-168}} It later appears on the albums ''[[Piano Solo (Thelonious Monk album)|Piano Solo]]'' under the name \"Mangan\u00e8se\",{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=177}} and on ''[[Straight, No Chaser (Thelonious Monk album)|Straight, No Chaser]]''. The tune was initially called \"Weetee\", which was the nickname for Monk's cousin, Evelyn. [[Margo Guryan]] also wrote lyrics for the tune.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=369-370}}\n\n===Well, You Needn't===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form that is one of Monk's most popular tunes, and is famous for its chromatically ascending/descending chords. The tune was earlier known as \"You Need 'Na\". The tune was first recorded October 24, 1947 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=127-128}} It later appears on ''[[Piano Solo (Thelonious Monk album)|Piano Solo]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=177}} ''[[Monk's Music]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=221-223}} and on ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses (film)#Musical score and soundtrack|Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=271}} Live versions appear on most of Monk's live albums.\n\nThe title was inspired by jazz singer Charles Beamon. Monk wrote a song and told Beamon he was going to name it after him, to which Beamon replied, \"Well, you need not\".<ref name=\"standards\">{{cite book |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=The Jazz Standards: A Guide to the Repertoire |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-19-993739-4 |page=452}}</ref>\n\nThere are three widely played versions of the tune;\n*Monk's version uses an F pedal in the A section, with an obbligato figure in addition to the melody. The line rises chromatically from C for each bar, then descends when it has reached E. The bridge starts on D{{music|b}}, then ascends and descends chromatically to C, the dominant.\n*Monk would in later versions play alternatingly F and G{{music|b}} when comping, but keep the bridge as it was.\n*[[Miles Davis]]'s version of the tune is comparatively more popular. Davis alters the A section's main motif, and tritone substitutes Monk's changes during the bridge.

The tune was originally titled \"Twilight with Nellie\", but [[Pannonica de Koenigswarter]] suggested instead to use the [[French language|French]] word for twilight, which is ''crepuscule''. The tune was first recorded with Monk's septet for ''[[Monk's Music]]''; on that album (and on many of its reissues), \"Crepuscule\" was spelled \"Crepescule\" (3 ''e'''s, 1 ''u''). {{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=221-223}} The tune also appears on ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses (film)#Musical score and soundtrack|Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=271}} ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]''.,{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=335}} and on the live albums from [[Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall|Carnegie Hall]], [[The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall|Town Hall]],{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=258-259}} [[Monk in France|France]] and [[Thelonious Monk in Italy|Italy]].\n\n===Criss-Cross===\n\"Criss-Cross\" (originally titled \"Sailor Cap\"){{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=154-155}} was one Monk's very first compositions, he wrote early in 1944 as response to a collaborative project between Monk, [[Mary Lou Williams]], and [[Bud Powell]].{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=93}} It was first recorded July 23, 1951, for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions, and was later featured on the 1964 [[Criss-Cross (album)|album of the same name]].{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=332}} On the first version, the tune is in a standard 32-bar AABA-form, but in the last version, the two last bars of the B-section are dropped.<ref name=\"iverson\" />\n\nThe tune inspired [[Gunther Schuller]] to compose variations on ''Criss-Cross'', which premiered May 17, 1960, and was later released on ''[[Jazz Abstractions]]'', featuring [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Eric Dolphy]] as soloists.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=288-289}}\n\n\n==E==\n===Epistrophy===\n\"Epistrophy\" (initially called \"Fly Rite\" or \"[[Iambic pentameter]]\") was co-written with [[Kenny Clarke]], and was copyrighted June 2, 1941, and was the first tune copyrighted by Monk. It is a relatively atonal 32-bar tune in ABCB-form, though the key center is C{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThe main melodic theme was composed by Clarke, after experimenting with fingerings on the ukulele, and the chords where written by Monk.

In the 1980s, [[Jon Hendricks]] wrote lyrics for the song for [[Carmen McRae]], who released it on her album ''[[Carmen Sings Monk]]'' under the name \"Looking Back\".

The tune was later retitled \"Ruby, My Dear\" after Rubie Richardson, Monk's first love and his older sister Marion's best friend. It was however not for nostalgic reasons, but because the first phrase of the tune fit with the new title.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=116}} It was first recorded October 24, 1947 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=128-129}}{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=235-236}} The tune later appears on ''[[Monk's Music]]'', ''[[Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=235-236}} ''[[Thelonious Alone in San Francisco]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=277-278}} and on ''[[Solo Monk]]''.\n\nLyrics were written by Sally Swisher and the song was recorded in 1988 by [[Carmen McRae]] as part of her studio album ''[[Carmen Sings Monk]]''.

The tune was initially titled it \"Classified Information\",{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=282}} but he opted to retitle it to \"Worry Later\", when recording it for the first time April 29, 1960 for the album [[Thelonious Monk at the Blackhawk]].{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=287-288}} When it appeared on the album ''[[Monk in Italy]]'', it finally appeared under the title \"San Francisco Holiday\", which Monk named after his family's long stay in [[San Francisco]]. [[Margo Guryan]] also wrote lyrics for the tune.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=369-370}}\n\n===Shuffle Boil===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form, with an unusual bass ostinato. The title is a corruption of \"shuffle ball\", which is a move commonly used in [[tap dance]]. It was first recorded by [[Gigi Gryce]] with Monk as a sideman on October 15, 1955 for Gryce's album ''[[Nica's Tempo]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=193-194}} and later appears on ''[[It's Monk's Time]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=357}}\n\n===Sixteen===\nA 16-bar tune in AABA-form, and the title is from the tune's number of bars. Its only recording was done May 30, 1952, for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions, but was not released officially until [[Mosaic Records]] released their compilation of Monk's [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=158}}\n\n===Skippy===\nA 32-bar tune in ABAC-form, and is based entirely on cycling dominant chords (or their [[tritone substitution]]s). The tune's tonality is completely hidden until the last 4 bars clearly establish A{{music|flat}}-major. The tune was named after Nellie Monk's sister, whose real name was Evelyn.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=33}} Its only recording was done May 30, 1952, for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions,{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=158}} but has since the 2000s became a popular tune, with many cover versions. It is commonly agreed that the \"Skippy\"'s changes are based on Monk's reharmonization of \"[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]\" (which he would later record on [[The Unique Thelonious Monk]],{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=205}} and on ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=332}}) but [[Ethan Iverson]] argues that Monk composed \"Skippy\", then applied the changes to \"Tea for Two\".<ref name=\"iverson\" />\n\n===Something in Blue===\nA 12-bar blues in B{{music|b}}.

For copyright reasons, the song was renamed \"Get It Straight\".\n\nMusic educator Mark C.

The A-section is based on [[rhythm changes]], and is borrowed from [[Coleman Hawkins]]'s tune \"Stuffy\".{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=350-351}}\n\n==T==\n===Teo===\nA 24-bar tune in B{{music|b}} minor in ABA-form. \"Teo\" was written as a tribute to Monk's, and many other of Columbia's jazz musicians', producer, [[Teo Macero]]. The changes are based on the standard \"[[Topsy (instrumental)|Topsy]]\".{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=350-351}} The tune was first recorded March 9, 1964, and first appeared on the album ''[[Monk (1964 album)|Monk]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=357}}\n\n===Thelonious===\nA 36-bar tune in AABA-form (8-10-8-10) in B{{music|b}} major. The tune was first recorded October 15, 1947 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=127-128}} It was later recorded for the album ''[[Underground (Thelonious Monk album)|Underground]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=393-394}} and live versions appear on the albums ''[[The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=258-259}} and ''[[Live at the Jazz Workshop]]''.\n\nThe A-section is based on a riff that Monk used very often, dating back to his days as the house pianist at [[Minton's Playhouse]]. The riff contains only the pitches B{{music|b}} and A, insisting on the tonic, and is reharmonized with descending chords.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=127-128}}\n\n===Think of One===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form. The tune was first recorded November 13, 1953 and appears on the album ''[[Monk (1954 album)|Monk]]'', and later appears on the album ''[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]''. The tune is very similar in conception to \"Thelonious\", as the melody insists the tonic, with albeit more unexpected changes than in \"Thelonious\".{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=164-165}}\n\n===Trinkle, Tinkle===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form that is notorious for its difficult melody. It was first recorded December 18, 1952 for the album ''[[Thelonious Monk Trio]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=159-161}} and later appears on the album ''[[Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane]]'' and on ''[[Monk's Blues]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=400-403}}\n\nThere are two stories about the origin of the title, the first explains that producer [[Ira Gitler]] may have misheard when Monk said the title of the tune in studio - Gitler reports that Monk may have said \"Trinkle, Tinkle, like a star\" instead of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, like a star\". It is also believed that the title is a corruption of the term \"tickler\", which was what the old [[stride (music)|stride]] pianists used to call themselves.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=159-161}}\n\n===Two Timer===\nA tune that was never recorded by Monk, but was first recorded by [[Jackie McLean]] for his album ''[[A Fickle Sonance]]'', under the title \"Five Will Get You Ten\". The tune was credited to [[Sonny Clark]], who was struggling with [[heroin]] addiction at the time, and was a frequent visitor to Monk's friend, [[Pannonica de Koenigswarter]]'s house. It is believed that since Monk kept most of his sheet music in Pannonica's house, Clark stole the lead sheet and claimed as his own, in hopes of the tune being a hit.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=311}} The original lead sheet was later discovered around the '90s, and was first recorded by [[T. S. Monk|Monk's son]] for his album ''Monk on Monk''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=563-569}}\n\n==U==\n===Ugly Beauty===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form, and was only recorded once, on December 21, 1967, for the album ''[[Underground (Thelonious Monk album)|Underground]]''. It was Monk's drummer [[Ben Riley]] suggestion to play the tune as a waltz, and \"Ugly Beauty\" is therefore significant for being Monk's only waltz.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=393-394}} Mike Ferro later wrote lyrics to the tune, and the song was recorded in 1988 by [[Carmen McRae]] as part of her studio album ''[[Carmen Sings Monk]]''. For copyright reasons, the song was renamed \"Still We Dream\".\n\n==W==\n===We See===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form, and was first recorded May 11, 1954 for the album ''[[Monk (1954 album)|Monk]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=167-168}} It later appears on the albums ''[[Piano Solo (Thelonious Monk album)|Piano Solo]]'' under the name \"Mangan\u00e8se\",{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=177}} and on ''[[Straight, No Chaser (Thelonious Monk album)|Straight, No Chaser]]''. The tune was initially called \"Weetee\", which was the nickname for Monk's cousin, Evelyn. [[Margo Guryan]] also wrote lyrics for the tune.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=369-370}}\n\n===Well, You Needn't===\nA 32-bar tune in AABA-form that is one of Monk's most popular tunes, and is famous for its chromatically ascending/descending chords. The tune was earlier known as \"You Need 'Na\". The tune was first recorded October 24, 1947 for the ''[[Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1|Genius of Modern Music]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=127-128}} It later appears on ''[[Piano Solo (Thelonious Monk album)|Piano Solo]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=177}} ''[[Monk's Music]]'',{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=221-223}} and on ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses (film)#Musical score and soundtrack|Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960]]''.{{sfn|Kelley|2009|p=271}} Live versions appear on most of Monk's live albums.\n\nThe title was inspired by jazz singer Charles Beamon. Monk wrote a song and told Beamon he was going to name it after him, to which Beamon replied, \"Well, you need not\".<ref name=\"standards\">{{cite book |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=The Jazz Standards: A Guide to the Repertoire |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-19-993739-4 |page=452}}</ref>\n\nThere are three widely played versions of the tune;\n*Monk's version uses an F pedal in the A section, with an obbligato figure in addition to the melody. The line rises chromatically from C for each bar, then descends when it has reached E. The bridge starts on D{{music|b}}, then ascends and descends chromatically to C, the dominant.\n*Monk would in later versions play alternatingly F and G{{music|b}} when comping, but keep the bridge as it was.\n*[[Miles Davis]]'s version of the tune is comparatively more popular. Davis alters the A section's main motif, and tritone substitutes Monk's changes during the bridge. Therefore, Miles Davis starts the melody of the bridge a half-step too low.<ref>{{cite book |last=Owens |first=Thomas |title=Bebop: The Music and Its Players |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510651-0 |pages=116\u2013117, 215 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"iverson\" /> He later recorded a contrafact of the tune, called \"I Didn't\", and appears on the album ''[[The Musings of Miles]]''.\n\nMike Ferro later wrote lyrics to the tune, and the song was recorded in 1988 by [[Carmen McRae]] as part of her studio album ''[[Carmen Sings Monk]]''.

In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points.

In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points.

In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a [[detective fiction]] writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the [[Great Depression]]. His first short story, \"[[Blackmailers Don't Shoot]]\", was published in 1933 in ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]],'' a popular [[pulp magazine]]. His first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by [[Robert B. Parker]]). All but ''[[Playback (novel)|Playback]]'' have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the [[Mystery Writers of America]].<ref>Chandler, Raymond (1950). ''Trouble Is My Business''. Vintage Books, 1988, \"About the Author\".</ref>\n\nChandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is considered to be a founder of the [[hard-boiled]] school of detective fiction, along with [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[James M. Cain]] and other ''Black Mask'' writers. The [[protagonist]] of his novels, [[Philip Marlowe]], like Hammett's [[Sam Spade]], is considered by some to be synonymous with \"private detective\". Both were played in films by [[Humphrey Bogart]], whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.\n\nAt least three of Chandler's novels have been regarded as masterpieces: ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1940), ''[[The Little Sister]]'' (1949), and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1953). ''The Long Goodbye'' was praised in an anthology of American crime stories as \"arguably the first book since Hammett's ''The Glass Key'', published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery\". Chandler's reputation has grown in recent years.<ref>Pronzini, p. 169,</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Raymond Chandler house, Waterford.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[blue plaque]] marks the house in Cathedral Square where Chandler stayed in [[Waterford]], Ireland.]] \nChandler was born in 1888 in [[Chicago]], the son of Florence Dart (Thornton) and Maurice Benjamin Chandler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/biographies/85557537/raymond-thornton-chandler |title=Raymond Thornton Chandler |website=Connection.ebscohost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}</ref> He spent his early years in [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska]], living with his mother and father near his cousins and his aunt (his mother's sister) and uncle.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hiney-chandler.html |title= Chapter One Raymond Chandler| work =The New York Times | accessdate = June 2, 2014}}</ref> Chandler's father, an alcoholic civil engineer who worked for the railway, abandoned the family.

Raymond was a first cousin to the actor [[Max Adrian]], a founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Max's mother Mabel was a sister of Florence Thornton. Chandler was classically educated at [[Dulwich College]], London (a [[Public school (UK)|public school]] whose alumni include the authors [[P. G. Wodehouse]]<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\" /> and [[C. S. Forester]]). He spent some of his childhood summers in Waterford with his mother's family.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://waterfordireland.tripod.com/raymond_chandler.htm | title = Raymond Chandler | work = Waterford Ireland | publisher = Tripod | accessdate = 2012-07-19}}</ref> He did not go to university, instead spending time in Paris and [[Munich]] improving his foreign language skills. In 1907, he was naturalized as a [[British subject]] in order to take the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|civil service]] examination, which he passed. He then took an [[Admiralty]] job, lasting just over a year. His first poem was published during that time.\n\nChandler disliked the servility of the civil service and resigned, to the consternation of his family, and became a reporter for the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and the Bristol ''[[Western Gazette]]'' newspapers. He was unsuccessful as a journalist, but he published reviews and continued writing [[Romanticism|romantic]] poetry. An encounter with the slightly older [[Richard Barham Middleton]] is said to have influenced him into postponing his career as writer. \"I met... also a young, bearded, and sad-eyed man called Richard Middleton.&nbsp;... Shortly afterwards he committed suicide in Antwerp, a suicide of despair, I should say. The incident made a great impression on me, because Middleton struck me as having far more talent than I was ever likely to possess; and if he couldn't make a go of it, it wasn't very likely that I could.\"  Accounting for that time he said, \"Of course in those days as now there were...clever young men who made a decent living as freelances for the numerous literary weeklies\", but \"I was distinctly not a clever young man. Nor was I at all a happy young man.\"{{Sfn | Chandler | 1962 | p = 24}}\n\nIn 1912, he borrowed money from his Waterford uncle, who expected it to be repaid with interest, and returned to America, visiting his aunt and uncle before settling in San Francisco for a time, where he took a correspondence course in bookkeeping, finishing ahead of schedule. His mother joined him there in late 1912. Encouraged by Chandler's attorney/oilman friend Warren Lloyd, they moved to Los Angeles in 1913,<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Florence arrives | date = December 1912 | title = Passenger Manifest SS Merion}}</ref> where he strung tennis rackets, picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving. He found steady employment with the Los Angeles Creamery. In 1917, he traveled to Vancouver where in August he enlisted in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. He saw combat in the trenches in France with the [[Gordon Highlanders]], was twice hospitalized with [[Spanish flu]] during the pandemic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekeptgirl.com/2017/07/the-clews-from-raymond-chandlers-war.html|title=The clews from Raymond Chandler's war|website=www.thekeptgirl.com|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref> and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) when the war ended.<ref name = \"nyrb-12-06-2007\" />\n\nAfter the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]], he returned to Los Angeles by way of Canada, and soon began a love affair with Pearl Eugenie (\"Cissy\") Pascal, a married woman 18 years his senior and the stepmother of Gordon Pascal, with whom Chandler had enlisted.<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> Cissy amicably divorced her husband, Julian, in 1920, but Chandler's mother disapproved of the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage. For the next four years Chandler supported both his mother and Cissy. After the death of Florence Chandler on September 26, 1923, he was free to marry Cissy. They were married on February 6, 1924.<ref name = \"nyrb-12-06-2007\" /><ref name = rcinfo>{{Citation | url = http://raymondchandler.info/ | title = Raymond Chandler}}'s Shamus Town Timeline and Residences pages using official government sources (death certificate, census, military & civil \u2013 city & phone directories).</ref> Having begun in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, Chandler was by 1931 a highly paid vice president of the [[Dabney Oil Syndicate]], but his alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity with female employees, and threatened suicides<ref name = \"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> contributed to his dismissal a year later.\n\n===As a writer===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}<!--several paragraphs without citations-->\nIn straitened financial circumstances during the [[Great Depression]], Chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living, teaching himself to write [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] by studying the [[Perry Mason]] stories of [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]. Chandler's first professional work, \"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\", was published in ''Black Mask'' magazine in 1933. According to genre historian Herbert Ruhm, \"Chandler, who worked slowly and painstakingly, revising again and again, had taken five months to write the story.  Erle Stanley Gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four days&mdash;and turned out an estimated one thousand.\"<ref>Herbert Ruhm, \"Introduction\", in Herbert Ruhm (1977), ed., ''The Hard-boiled Detective:  Stories from \"Black Mask\" Magazine, 1920-1951'', New York:  Vintage, p. xvii.</ref>\n\nHis first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', was published in 1939, featuring the detective Philip Marlowe, speaking in the first person.  In 1950, Chandler described in a letter to his English publisher, Hamish Hamilton, why he began reading pulp magazines and later wrote for them:\n\n<blockquote>Wandering up and down the Pacific Coast in an automobile I began to read pulp magazines, because they were cheap enough to throw away and because I never had at any time any taste for the kind of thing which is known as women's magazines. This was in the great days of the ''Black Mask'' (if I may call them great days) and it struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest, even though it had its crude aspect. I decided that this might be a good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small amount of money at the same time.  I spent five months over an 18,000 word novelette and sold it for $180. After that I never looked back, although I had a good many uneasy periods looking forward.<ref>Chandler, Raymond (1969). p. vii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis second Marlowe novel, ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1940), became the basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters, including the [[1944 in film|1944]] film ''[[Murder My Sweet]]'', which marked the screen debut of the Marlowe character, played by [[Dick Powell]] (whose depiction of Marlowe Chandler reportedly applauded). Literary success and film adaptations led to a demand for Chandler himself as a screenwriter. He and [[Billy Wilder]] co-wrote ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), based on [[James M. Cain]]'s [[Double Indemnity (novel)|novel of the same title]]. The [[film noir|noir]] screenplay was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. Said Wilder, \"I would just guide the structure and I would also do a lot of the dialogue, and he (Chandler) would then comprehend and start constructing too.\" Wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which makes the film so memorable was largely Chandler's.\n\nChandler's only produced original screenplay was ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946). He had not written a [[denouement]] for the script and, according to producer [[John Houseman]], Chandler agreed to complete the script only if drunk and attended by round-the-clock secretaries and drivers, which Houseman agreed to. The script gained Chandler's second Academy Award nomination for screenplay.\n\nChandler collaborated on the screenplay of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), an ironic murder story based on [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[Strangers on a Train (novel)|novel]], which he thought implausible. Chandler clashed with Hitchcock to such an extent that they stopped talking, especially after Hitchcock heard Chandler had referred to him as \"that fat bastard\". Hitchcock reportedly made a show of throwing Chandler's two draft screenplays into the studio trash can while holding his nose, but Chandler retained the lead screenwriting credit along with Czenzi Ormonde.\n\nIn 1946 the Chandlers moved to [[La Jolla]], California, an affluent coastal neighborhood of San Diego, where Chandler wrote two more Philip Marlowe novels, ''The Long Goodbye'' and his last completed work, ''Playback''. The latter was derived from an unproduced courtroom drama screenplay he had written for [[Universal Studios]].\n\nFour chapters of a novel, unfinished at his death, were transformed into a final Philip Marlowe novel, ''[[Poodle Springs]]'', by the mystery writer and Chandler admirer [[Robert B. Parker]], in 1989. Parker shares the authorship with Chandler. Parker subsequently wrote a sequel to ''The Big Sleep'' entitled ''[[Perchance to Dream (novel)|Perchance to Dream]]'', which was salted with quotes from the original novel. Chandler's final Marlowe short story, circa 1957, was entitled \"The Pencil\". It later provided the basis of an episode of the HBO miniseries (1983\u201386), ''[[Philip Marlowe, Private Eye]]'', starring Powers Boothe as Marlowe.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Princess and the Pedlar\" (1917), a previously unknown comic operetta, with libretto by Chandler and music by Julian Pascal, was discovered<ref>\n{{Citation\n | last = Weinman\n | first = Sarah\n | title = Unpublished Raymond Chandler Work Discovered in Library of Congress\n | pages =\n | newspaper = The Guardian\n | location = London\n | date = December 2, 2014\n | url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/02/raymond-chandler-libretto-library-congress\n | archiveurl = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/02/raymond-chandler-libretto-library-congress\n | archivedate = December 2, 2014 }}</ref> among the uncatalogued holdings of the [[Library of Congress]].

Heartbroken and drunk, Chandler neglected to inter her cremated remains, and they sat for 57 years in a storage locker in the basement of Cypress View Mausoleum.\n\nAfter Cissy's death, Chandler's loneliness worsened his propensity for [[clinical depression]]; he returned to drinking alcohol, never quitting it for long, and the quality and quantity of his writing suffered.<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> In 1955, he attempted suicide. In ''The Long Embrace: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved'', Judith Freeman says it was \"a cry for help,\" given that he called the police beforehand, saying he planned to kill himself. Chandler's personal and professional life were both helped and complicated by the women to whom he was attracted\u2014notably Helga Greene, his literary agent; Jean Fracasse, his secretary; [[Sonia Brownell|Sonia Orwell]] ([[George Orwell]]'s widow); and [[Natasha Spender]] ([[Stephen Spender]]'s wife). Chandler regained his U.S. citizenship in 1956, while retaining his British rights too.\n\nAfter a respite in England, he returned to La Jolla. He died at Scripps Memorial Hospital of pneumonial peripheral vascular shock and prerenal uremia (according to the death certificate) in 1959. Helga Greene inherited Chandler's $60,000 estate, after prevailing in a 1960 lawsuit filed by Fracasse contesting Chandler's [[Holographic will|holographic]] [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will.\n\nChandler is buried at [[Mount Hope Cemetery (San Diego)|Mount Hope Cemetery]], in San Diego, California. As Frank MacShane noted in his biography, ''The Life of Raymond Chandler'', Chandler wished to be cremated and placed next to Cissy in Cypress View Mausoleum. Instead, he was buried in Mount Hope, because he had left no funeral or burial instructions.<ref>Hiney (1997). pp. 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Chandler historian Loren Latker, with the assistance of attorney Aissa Wayne (daughter of [[John Wayne]]), brought a petition to disinter Cissy's remains and reinter them with Chandler in Mount Hope. After a hearing in September 2010 in [[Superior Courts of California|San Diego Superior Court]], Judge Richard S. Whitney entered an order granting Latker's request.<ref>Bell, Diane (2010-09-08).

The shared gravestone reads, \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\", a quotation from ''The Big Sleep''. Chandler's original gravestone, placed by Jean Fracasse and her children, is still at the head of his grave; the new one is at the foot.\n\n==Views on pulp fiction==\nIn his introduction to ''Trouble Is My Business'' (1950), a collection of four of his short stories, Chandler provided insight on the formula for the detective story and how the pulp magazines differed from previous detective stories:\n\n{{bquote|The emotional basis of the standard detective story was and had always been that murder will out and justice will be done. Its technical basis was the relative insignificance of everything except the final denouement. What led up to that was more or less passage work. The denouement would justify everything. The technical basis of the ''Black Mask'' type of story on the other hand was that the scene outranked the plot, in the sense that a good plot was one which made good scenes. The ideal mystery was one you would read if the end was missing.  We who tried to write it had the same point of view as the film makers. When I first went to Hollywood a very intelligent producer told me that you couldn't make a successful motion picture from a mystery story, because the whole point was a disclosure that took a few seconds of screen time while the audience was reaching for its hat. He was wrong, but only because he was thinking of the wrong kind of mystery.}}\n\nChandler also described the struggle that writers of pulp fiction had in following the formula demanded by the editors of the pulp magazines:\n\n{{bquote|As I look back on my stories it would be absurd if I did not wish they had been better. But if they had been much better they would not have been published. If the formula had been a little less rigid, more of the writing of that time might have survived. Some of us tried pretty hard to break out of the formula, but we usually got caught and sent back. To exceed the limits of a formula without destroying it is the dream of every magazine writer who is not a hopeless hack.<ref>Chandler (1950), pp. viii\u2013ix.</ref>}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nCritics and writers, including [[W. H. Auden]], [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[Ian Fleming]], greatly admired Chandler's prose.<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> In a radio discussion with Chandler, Fleming said that Chandler offered \"some of the finest dialogue written in any prose today\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/james_bond/12601.shtml |title=Archive \u2013 James Bond \u2013 Ian Fleming and Raymond Chandler |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}</ref> Contemporary mystery writer [[Paul Levine]] has described Chandler's style as the \"literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Levine |url=http://www.paul-levine.com/hard-boiled-dialogue-philip-marlowe-jake-lassiter/ |title=Hard-Boiled Dialogue: From Philip Marlowe to Jake Lassiter |website=Paul-levine.com |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}</ref> Chandler's swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical [[simile]]s are original: \"The muzzle of the [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel\"; \"He had a heart as big as one of [[Mae West|Mae West's]] hips\"; \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\"; \"I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor.\" Chandler's writing redefined the [[Private investigator|private eye]] fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective \"Chandleresque,\" and inevitably became the subject of parody and [[pastiche]]. Yet the detective Philip Marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy, but a complex, sometimes sentimental man with few friends, who attended university, who speaks some [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and sometimes admires Mexicans, and who is a student of chess and classical music. He is a man who refuses a prospective client's fee for a job he considers unethical.\n\nThe high regard in which Chandler is generally held today is in contrast to the critical sniping that stung the author during his lifetime. In a March 1942 letter to Blanche Knopf, published in ''Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler'', he wrote, \"The thing that rather gets me down is that when I write something that is tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, I get panned for being tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, and then when I try to tone down a bit and develop the mental and emotional side of a situation, I get panned for leaving out what I was panned for putting in the first time.\"\n\nAlthough his work enjoys general acclaim today, Chandler has been criticized for certain aspects of his writing. The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reviewer Patrick Anderson described his plots as \"rambling at best and incoherent at worst\" (notoriously, even Chandler did not know who murdered the chauffeur in ''The Big Sleep''[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/04/entertainment/ca-60391]) and criticized Chandler's treatment of black, female, and homosexual characters, calling him a \"rather nasty man at times\".<ref>Woods, Paula L.

Arguably the most notable adaptation is ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), by [[Howard Hawks]], with [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Philip Marlowe. [[William Faulkner]] was a co-writer of the screenplay. Chandler's few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the American ''film noir'' genre. Notable for its revised take on both the Marlowe character, transplanting the novel to the 1970s, is [[Robert Altman]]'s 1973 neo-noir adaptation of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''.\n\nChandler was also a perceptive critic of detective fiction; his essay \"[[The Simple Art of Murder]]\" is the canonical essay in the field.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 11th issue of the influential [[Cyberpunk]] fanzine ''[[Cheap Truth]]'', [[Bruce Sterling|Vincent Omniaveritas]] conducted a fictitious interview with Chandler.

In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a [[detective fiction]] writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the [[Great Depression]]. His first short story, \"[[Blackmailers Don't Shoot]]\", was published in 1933 in ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]],'' a popular [[pulp magazine]]. His first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by [[Robert B. Parker]]). All but ''[[Playback (novel)|Playback]]'' have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the [[Mystery Writers of America]].<ref>Chandler, Raymond (1950). ''Trouble Is My Business''. Vintage Books, 1988, \"About the Author\".</ref>\n\nChandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is considered to be a founder of the [[hard-boiled]] school of detective fiction, along with [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[James M. Cain]] and other ''Black Mask'' writers. The [[protagonist]] of his novels, [[Philip Marlowe]], like Hammett's [[Sam Spade]], is considered by some to be synonymous with \"private detective\". Both were played in films by [[Humphrey Bogart]], whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.\n\nAt least three of Chandler's novels have been regarded as masterpieces: ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1940), ''[[The Little Sister]]'' (1949), and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1953). ''The Long Goodbye'' was praised in an anthology of American crime stories as \"arguably the first book since Hammett's ''The Glass Key'', published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery\". Chandler's reputation has grown in recent years.<ref>Pronzini, p. 169,</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Raymond Chandler house, Waterford.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[blue plaque]] marks the house in Cathedral Square where Chandler stayed in [[Waterford]], Ireland.]] \nChandler was born in 1888 in [[Chicago]], the son of Florence Dart (Thornton) and Maurice Benjamin Chandler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/biographies/85557537/raymond-thornton-chandler |title=Raymond Thornton Chandler |website=Connection.ebscohost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}</ref> He spent his early years in [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska]], living with his mother and father near his cousins and his aunt (his mother's sister) and uncle.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hiney-chandler.html |title= Chapter One Raymond Chandler| work =The New York Times | accessdate = June 2, 2014}}</ref> Chandler's father, an alcoholic civil engineer who worked for the railway, abandoned the family.

Raymond was a first cousin to the actor [[Max Adrian]], a founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Max's mother Mabel was a sister of Florence Thornton. Chandler was classically educated at [[Dulwich College]], London (a [[Public school (UK)|public school]] whose alumni include the authors [[P. G. Wodehouse]]<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\" /> and [[C. S. Forester]]). He spent some of his childhood summers in Waterford with his mother's family.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://waterfordireland.tripod.com/raymond_chandler.htm | title = Raymond Chandler | work = Waterford Ireland | publisher = Tripod | accessdate = 2012-07-19}}</ref> He did not go to university, instead spending time in Paris and [[Munich]] improving his foreign language skills. In 1907, he was naturalized as a [[British subject]] in order to take the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|civil service]] examination, which he passed. He then took an [[Admiralty]] job, lasting just over a year. His first poem was published during that time.\n\nChandler disliked the servility of the civil service and resigned, to the consternation of his family, and became a reporter for the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and the Bristol ''[[Western Gazette]]'' newspapers. He was unsuccessful as a journalist, but he published reviews and continued writing [[Romanticism|romantic]] poetry. An encounter with the slightly older [[Richard Barham Middleton]] is said to have influenced him into postponing his career as writer. \"I met... also a young, bearded, and sad-eyed man called Richard Middleton.&nbsp;... Shortly afterwards he committed suicide in Antwerp, a suicide of despair, I should say. The incident made a great impression on me, because Middleton struck me as having far more talent than I was ever likely to possess; and if he couldn't make a go of it, it wasn't very likely that I could.\"  Accounting for that time he said, \"Of course in those days as now there were...clever young men who made a decent living as freelances for the numerous literary weeklies\", but \"I was distinctly not a clever young man. Nor was I at all a happy young man.\"{{Sfn | Chandler | 1962 | p = 24}}\n\nIn 1912, he borrowed money from his Waterford uncle, who expected it to be repaid with interest, and returned to America, visiting his aunt and uncle before settling in San Francisco for a time, where he took a correspondence course in bookkeeping, finishing ahead of schedule. His mother joined him there in late 1912. Encouraged by Chandler's attorney/oilman friend Warren Lloyd, they moved to Los Angeles in 1913,<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Florence arrives | date = December 1912 | title = Passenger Manifest SS Merion}}</ref> where he strung tennis rackets, picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving. He found steady employment with the Los Angeles Creamery. In 1917, he traveled to Vancouver where in August he enlisted in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. He saw combat in the trenches in France with the [[Gordon Highlanders]], was twice hospitalized with [[Spanish flu]] during the pandemic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekeptgirl.com/2017/07/the-clews-from-raymond-chandlers-war.html|title=The clews from Raymond Chandler's war|website=www.thekeptgirl.com|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref> and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) when the war ended.<ref name = \"nyrb-12-06-2007\" />\n\nAfter the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]], he returned to Los Angeles by way of Canada, and soon began a love affair with Pearl Eugenie (\"Cissy\") Pascal, a married woman 18 years his senior and the stepmother of Gordon Pascal, with whom Chandler had enlisted.<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> Cissy amicably divorced her husband, Julian, in 1920, but Chandler's mother disapproved of the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage. For the next four years Chandler supported both his mother and Cissy. After the death of Florence Chandler on September 26, 1923, he was free to marry Cissy. They were married on February 6, 1924.<ref name = \"nyrb-12-06-2007\" /><ref name = rcinfo>{{Citation | url = http://raymondchandler.info/ | title = Raymond Chandler}}'s Shamus Town Timeline and Residences pages using official government sources (death certificate, census, military & civil \u2013 city & phone directories).</ref> Having begun in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, Chandler was by 1931 a highly paid vice president of the [[Dabney Oil Syndicate]], but his alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity with female employees, and threatened suicides<ref name = \"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> contributed to his dismissal a year later.\n\n===As a writer===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}<!--several paragraphs without citations-->\nIn straitened financial circumstances during the [[Great Depression]], Chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living, teaching himself to write [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] by studying the [[Perry Mason]] stories of [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]. Chandler's first professional work, \"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\", was published in ''Black Mask'' magazine in 1933. According to genre historian Herbert Ruhm, \"Chandler, who worked slowly and painstakingly, revising again and again, had taken five months to write the story.  Erle Stanley Gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four days&mdash;and turned out an estimated one thousand.\"<ref>Herbert Ruhm, \"Introduction\", in Herbert Ruhm (1977), ed., ''The Hard-boiled Detective:  Stories from \"Black Mask\" Magazine, 1920-1951'', New York:  Vintage, p. xvii.</ref>  \n\nHis first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', was published in 1939, featuring the detective Philip Marlowe, speaking in the first person.  In 1950, Chandler described in a letter to his English publisher, Hamish Hamilton, why he began reading pulp magazines and later wrote for them:\n\n<blockquote>Wandering up and down the Pacific Coast in an automobile I began to read pulp magazines, because they were cheap enough to throw away and because I never had at any time any taste for the kind of thing which is known as women's magazines. This was in the great days of the ''Black Mask'' (if I may call them great days) and it struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest, even though it had its crude aspect. I decided that this might be a good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small amount of money at the same time.  I spent five months over an 18,000 word novelette and sold it for $180. After that I never looked back, although I had a good many uneasy periods looking forward.<ref>Chandler, Raymond (1969). p. vii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis second Marlowe novel, ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1940), became the basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters, including the [[1944 in film|1944]] film ''[[Murder My Sweet]]'', which marked the screen debut of the Marlowe character, played by [[Dick Powell]] (whose depiction of Marlowe Chandler reportedly applauded). Literary success and film adaptations led to a demand for Chandler himself as a screenwriter. He and [[Billy Wilder]] co-wrote ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), based on [[James M. Cain]]'s [[Double Indemnity (novel)|novel of the same title]]. The [[film noir|noir]] screenplay was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. Said Wilder, \"I would just guide the structure and I would also do a lot of the dialogue, and he (Chandler) would then comprehend and start constructing too.\" Wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which makes the film so memorable was largely Chandler's.\n\nChandler's only produced original screenplay was ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946). He had not written a [[denouement]] for the script and, according to producer [[John Houseman]], Chandler agreed to complete the script only if drunk and attended by round-the-clock secretaries and drivers, which Houseman agreed to. The script gained Chandler's second Academy Award nomination for screenplay.\n\nChandler collaborated on the screenplay of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), an ironic murder story based on [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[Strangers on a Train (novel)|novel]], which he thought implausible. Chandler clashed with Hitchcock to such an extent that they stopped talking, especially after Hitchcock heard Chandler had referred to him as \"that fat bastard\". Hitchcock reportedly made a show of throwing Chandler's two draft screenplays into the studio trash can while holding his nose, but Chandler retained the lead screenwriting credit along with Czenzi Ormonde.\n\nIn 1946 the Chandlers moved to [[La Jolla]], California, an affluent coastal neighborhood of San Diego, where Chandler wrote two more Philip Marlowe novels, ''The Long Goodbye'' and his last completed work, ''Playback''. The latter was derived from an unproduced courtroom drama screenplay he had written for [[Universal Studios]].\n\nFour chapters of a novel, unfinished at his death, were transformed into a final Philip Marlowe novel, ''[[Poodle Springs]]'', by the mystery writer and Chandler admirer [[Robert B. Parker]], in 1989. Parker shares the authorship with Chandler. Parker subsequently wrote a sequel to ''The Big Sleep'' entitled ''[[Perchance to Dream (novel)|Perchance to Dream]]'', which was salted with quotes from the original novel. Chandler's final Marlowe short story, circa 1957, was entitled \"The Pencil\". It later provided the basis of an episode of the HBO miniseries (1983\u201386), ''[[Philip Marlowe, Private Eye]]'', starring Powers Boothe as Marlowe.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Princess and the Pedlar\" (1917), a previously unknown comic operetta, with libretto by Chandler and music by Julian Pascal, was discovered<ref>\n{{Citation\n | last = Weinman\n | first = Sarah\n | title = Unpublished Raymond Chandler Work Discovered in Library of Congress\n | pages =\n | newspaper = The Guardian\n | location = London\n | date = December 2, 2014\n | url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/02/raymond-chandler-libretto-library-congress\n | archiveurl = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/02/raymond-chandler-libretto-library-congress\n | archivedate = December 2, 2014 }}</ref> among the uncatalogued holdings of the [[Library of Congress]].

Heartbroken and drunk, Chandler neglected to inter her cremated remains, and they sat for 57 years in a storage locker in the basement of Cypress View Mausoleum.\n\nAfter Cissy's death, Chandler's loneliness worsened his propensity for [[clinical depression]]; he returned to drinking alcohol, never quitting it for long, and the quality and quantity of his writing suffered.<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> In 1955, he attempted suicide. In ''The Long Embrace: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved'', Judith Freeman says it was \"a cry for help,\" given that he called the police beforehand, saying he planned to kill himself. Chandler's personal and professional life were both helped and complicated by the women to whom he was attracted\u2014notably Helga Greene, his literary agent; Jean Fracasse, his secretary; [[Sonia Brownell|Sonia Orwell]] ([[George Orwell]]'s widow); and [[Natasha Spender]] ([[Stephen Spender]]'s wife). Chandler regained his U.S. citizenship in 1956, while retaining his British rights too. \n\nAfter a respite in England, he returned to La Jolla. He died at Scripps Memorial Hospital of pneumonial peripheral vascular shock and prerenal uremia (according to the death certificate) in 1959. Helga Greene inherited Chandler's $60,000 estate, after prevailing in a 1960 lawsuit filed by Fracasse contesting Chandler's [[Holographic will|holographic]] [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will.\n\nChandler is buried at [[Mount Hope Cemetery (San Diego)|Mount Hope Cemetery]], in San Diego, California. As Frank MacShane noted in his biography, ''The Life of Raymond Chandler'', Chandler wished to be cremated and placed next to Cissy in Cypress View Mausoleum. Instead, he was buried in Mount Hope, because he had left no funeral or burial instructions.<ref>Hiney (1997). pp. 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Chandler historian Loren Latker, with the assistance of attorney Aissa Wayne (daughter of [[John Wayne]]), brought a petition to disinter Cissy's remains and reinter them with Chandler in Mount Hope. After a hearing in September 2010 in [[Superior Courts of California|San Diego Superior Court]], Judge Richard S. Whitney entered an order granting Latker's request.<ref>Bell, Diane (2010-09-08).

The shared gravestone reads, \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\", a quotation from ''The Big Sleep''. Chandler's original gravestone, placed by Jean Fracasse and her children, is still at the head of his grave; the new one is at the foot.\n\n==Views on pulp fiction==\nIn his introduction to ''Trouble Is My Business'' (1950), a collection of four of his short stories, Chandler provided insight on the formula for the detective story and how the pulp magazines differed from previous detective stories:\n\n{{bquote|The emotional basis of the standard detective story was and had always been that murder will out and justice will be done. Its technical basis was the relative insignificance of everything except the final denouement. What led up to that was more or less passage work. The denouement would justify everything. The technical basis of the ''Black Mask'' type of story on the other hand was that the scene outranked the plot, in the sense that a good plot was one which made good scenes. The ideal mystery was one you would read if the end was missing.  We who tried to write it had the same point of view as the film makers. When I first went to Hollywood a very intelligent producer told me that you couldn't make a successful motion picture from a mystery story, because the whole point was a disclosure that took a few seconds of screen time while the audience was reaching for its hat. He was wrong, but only because he was thinking of the wrong kind of mystery.}}\n\nChandler also described the struggle that writers of pulp fiction had in following the formula demanded by the editors of the pulp magazines:\n\n{{bquote|As I look back on my stories it would be absurd if I did not wish they had been better. But if they had been much better they would not have been published. If the formula had been a little less rigid, more of the writing of that time might have survived. Some of us tried pretty hard to break out of the formula, but we usually got caught and sent back.

H. Auden]], [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[Ian Fleming]], greatly admired Chandler's prose.<ref name=\"nyrb-12-06-2007\"/> In a radio discussion with Chandler, Fleming said that Chandler offered \"some of the finest dialogue written in any prose today\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/james_bond/12601.shtml |title=Archive \u2013 James Bond \u2013 Ian Fleming and Raymond Chandler |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}</ref> Contemporary mystery writer [[Paul Levine]] has described Chandler's style as the \"literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Levine |url=http://www.paul-levine.com/hard-boiled-dialogue-philip-marlowe-jake-lassiter/ |title=Hard-Boiled Dialogue: From Philip Marlowe to Jake Lassiter |website=Paul-levine.com |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}</ref> Chandler's swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical [[simile]]s are original: \"The muzzle of the [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel\"; \"He had a heart as big as one of [[Mae West|Mae West's]] hips\"; \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\"; \"I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor.\" Chandler's writing redefined the [[Private investigator|private eye]] fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective \"Chandleresque,\" and inevitably became the subject of parody and [[pastiche]]. Yet the detective Philip Marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy, but a complex, sometimes sentimental man with few friends, who attended university, who speaks some [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and sometimes admires Mexicans, and who is a student of chess and classical music. He is a man who refuses a prospective client's fee for a job he considers unethical.\n\nThe high regard in which Chandler is generally held today is in contrast to the critical sniping that stung the author during his lifetime. In a March 1942 letter to Blanche Knopf, published in ''Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler'', he wrote, \"The thing that rather gets me down is that when I write something that is tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, I get panned for being tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, and then when I try to tone down a bit and develop the mental and emotional side of a situation, I get panned for leaving out what I was panned for putting in the first time.\"\n\nAlthough his work enjoys general acclaim today, Chandler has been criticized for certain aspects of his writing. The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reviewer Patrick Anderson described his plots as \"rambling at best and incoherent at worst\" (notoriously, even Chandler did not know who murdered the chauffeur in ''The Big Sleep''[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/04/entertainment/ca-60391]) and criticized Chandler's treatment of black, female, and homosexual characters, calling him a \"rather nasty man at times\".<ref>Woods, Paula L.

Arguably the most notable adaptation is ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), by [[Howard Hawks]], with [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Philip Marlowe. [[William Faulkner]] was a co-writer of the screenplay. Chandler's few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the American ''film noir'' genre. Notable for its revised take on both the Marlowe character, transplanting the novel to the 1970s, is [[Robert Altman]]'s 1973 neo-noir adaptation of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''.\n\nChandler was also a perceptive critic of detective fiction; his essay \"[[The Simple Art of Murder]]\" is the canonical essay in the field.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 11th issue of the influential [[Cyberpunk]] fanzine ''[[Cheap Truth]]'', [[Bruce Sterling|Vincent Omniaveritas]] conducted a fictitious interview with Chandler. The interview opines that Chandler's views towards the potential for respectability in pulp and genre fiction could also be applied to Science Fiction, specifically the Cyberpunk movement.<ref>Sterling, Bruce (1985). \"Raymond Chandler Interview\".

Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the [[macula]]r area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in [[posterior vitreous detachment]] (PVD). PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and [[White blood cell|leucocyte]] response.  These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all [[scar|scar tissue]], tighten to create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker, or even cause swelling or [[macular edema]].  Often this results in distortions of vision that are clearly visible as bowing and blurring when looking at lines on chart paper (or an [[Amsler grid]]) within the macular area, or central 1.0 degree of visual arc.  Usually it occurs in one eye first, and may cause binocular [[diplopia]] or [[Diplopia|double vision]] if the image from one eye is too different from the image of the other eye. The distortions can make objects look different in size (usually larger = [[macropsia]]), especially in the central portion of the visual field, creating a localized or field dependent [[aniseikonia]] that cannot be fully corrected optically with glasses. Partial correction often improves the binocular vision considerably though.  In the young (under 50 years of age), these cells occasionally pull free and disintegrate on their own; but in the majority of sufferers (over 60 years of age) the condition is permanent.  The underlying [[photoreceptor cells]], [[rod cells]] and [[cone cells]], are usually not damaged unless the membrane becomes quite thick and hard; so usually there is no [[macular degeneration]].\n\n==Cause==\n[[Image:Amslergrid patientAMD.gif|frame|right|An [[Amsler grid]], as it might be viewed by a person with very severe macular pucker. Most cases of Epiretinal membrane are milder and show much smoother curved lines.]]\nThe source of the cells in epiretinal membranes (ERM) has been found to comprise glial cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, macrophages, fibrocytes, and collagen cells. These cells are found in varying proportions. Those from retinal breaks, previous retinal detachments, or cryopexy are composed mainly of dispersed RPE cells, while cells of glial origin predominate in idiopathic pathology. [[Laminocytes]] are the fundamental cell type in idiopathic ERMs. These cells are frequently found in small and dispersed numbers in eyes containing a PVD. The presence of retinal pigment cells invariably  indicates proliferative retinopathy and is only seen in association with a retinal detachment or tear.\n\nThe incidence of associated PVD range from 75-93%, and PVD is present in virtually all eyes with retinal breaks or retinal detachments and subsequent ERM formation. PVD can lead to retinal breaks that may liberate RPE cells that initiate membrane formation. Small breaks in the internal limiting membrane (ILM) after PVD also may provide retinal astrocytes access to the vitreous cavity, where they may subsequently proliferate. Many ERM also have ILM fragments that may be peeled separately.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gibran SK |author2=B Flemming |author3=T Stappler |author4=I Pearce |author5=C Groenewald |author6=H Heimann |author7=P Hiscott |author8=D Wong |title=Peel and peel again|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=92 |issue= 3|pages=373\u201377 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1136/bjo.2007.129965 |pmid=18055573|hdl=10722/90372 }}</ref>  Finally, vitreous hemorrhage, inflammation, or both associated with a PVD also may stimulate ERM formation.\n\nBoth sexes appear to be affected equally frequently.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nEpiretinal membrane is typically diagnosed by appearance with [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT) of the macula. Features include a thickening of the nerve fiber layer, a serrated appearance to the surface of the retina just beneath a thickened layer of glial tissue at the retinal-vitreous interface.\n\n==Prevention==\nThere is no good evidence for any preventive actions, since it appears this is a natural response to aging changes in the vitreous. [[Posterior vitreous detachment]] (PVD) has been estimated to occur in over 75 per cent of the population over age 65, that PVD is essentially a harmless condition (although with some disturbing symptoms), and that it does not normally threaten sight.  However, since epiretinal membrane appears to be a protective response to PVD, where [[inflammation]], [[exudative]] fluid,  and [[scar|scar tissue]] is formed,  it is possible that [[NSAIDs]] may reduce the inflammation response.  Usually there are flashing light experiences and the emergence of [[floater]]s in the eye that herald changes in the [[vitreous humour|vitreous]] before the epiretinal membrane forms.\n\n==Treatment==\nSurgeons can remove or peel the membrane through the [[sclera]] and improve vision by 2 or more [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] lines.  Usually the vitreous is replaced at the same time with clear (BSS) fluid, in a [[vitrectomy]].  Surgery is not usually recommended unless the distortions are severe enough to interfere with daily living, since there are the usual hazards of surgery, infections, and a possibility of [[retinal detachment]]. More common complications are high intraocular pressure, bleeding in the eye, and [[cataract]]s, which are the most frequent complication of vitrectomy surgery. Many patients will develop a cataract within the first few years after surgery.  In fact, the visual distortions and [[diplopia]] created by cataracts may sometimes be confused with epiretinal membrane.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThis ocular pathology was first described by Iwanoff in 1865, and it has been shown to occur in about 7% of the population.

Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the [[macula]]r area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in [[posterior vitreous detachment]] (PVD). PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and [[White blood cell|leucocyte]] response.  These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all [[scar|scar tissue]], tighten to create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker, or even cause swelling or [[macular edema]].  Often this results in distortions of vision that are clearly visible as bowing and blurring when looking at lines on chart paper (or an [[Amsler grid]]) within the macular area, or central 1.0 degree of visual arc.  Usually it occurs in one eye first, and may cause binocular [[diplopia]] or [[Diplopia|double vision]] if the image from one eye is too different from the image of the other eye. The distortions can make objects look different in size (usually larger = [[macropsia]]), especially in the central portion of the visual field, creating a localized or field dependent [[aniseikonia]] that cannot be fully corrected optically with glasses. Partial correction often improves the binocular vision considerably though.  In the young (under 50 years of age), these cells occasionally pull free and disintegrate on their own; but in the majority of sufferers (over 60 years of age) the condition is permanent.  The underlying [[photoreceptor cells]], [[rod cells]] and [[cone cells]], are usually not damaged unless the membrane becomes quite thick and hard; so usually there is no [[macular degeneration]].\n\n==Cause==\n[[Image:Amslergrid patientAMD.gif|frame|right|An [[Amsler grid]], as it might be viewed by a person with very severe macular pucker. Most cases of Epiretinal membrane are milder and show much smoother curved lines.]]\nThe source of the cells in epiretinal membranes (ERM) has been found to comprise glial cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, macrophages, fibrocytes, and collagen cells. These cells are found in varying proportions. Those from retinal breaks, previous retinal detachments, or cryopexy are composed mainly of dispersed RPE cells, while cells of glial origin predominate in idiopathic pathology. [[Laminocytes]] are the fundamental cell type in idiopathic ERMs. These cells are frequently found in small and dispersed numbers in eyes containing a PVD. The presence of retinal pigment cells invariably  indicates proliferative retinopathy and is only seen in association with a retinal detachment or tear.\n\nThe incidence of associated PVD range from 75-93%, and PVD is present in virtually all eyes with retinal breaks or retinal detachments and subsequent ERM formation. PVD can lead to retinal breaks that may liberate RPE cells that initiate membrane formation. Small breaks in the internal limiting membrane (ILM) after PVD also may provide retinal astrocytes access to the vitreous cavity, where they may subsequently proliferate. Many ERM also have ILM fragments that may be peeled separately.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gibran SK |author2=B Flemming |author3=T Stappler |author4=I Pearce |author5=C Groenewald |author6=H Heimann |author7=P Hiscott |author8=D Wong |title=Peel and peel again|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=92 |issue= 3|pages=373\u201377 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1136/bjo.2007.129965 |pmid=18055573|hdl=10722/90372 }}</ref>  Finally, vitreous hemorrhage, inflammation, or both associated with a PVD also may stimulate ERM formation.\n\nBoth sexes appear to be affected equally frequently.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nEpiretinal membrane is typically diagnosed by appearance with [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT) of the macula. Features include a thickening of the nerve fiber layer, a serrated appearance to the surface of the retina just beneath a thickened layer of glial tissue at the retinal-vitreous interface.\n\n==Prevention==\nThere is no good evidence for any preventive actions, since it appears this is a natural response to aging changes in the vitreous. [[Posterior vitreous detachment]] (PVD) has been estimated to occur in over 75 per cent of the population over age 65, that PVD is essentially a harmless condition (although with some disturbing symptoms), and that it does not normally threaten sight.  However, since epiretinal membrane appears to be a protective response to PVD, where [[inflammation]], [[exudative]] fluid,  and [[scar|scar tissue]] is formed,  it is possible that [[NSAIDs]] may reduce the inflammation response.  Usually there are flashing light experiences and the emergence of [[floater]]s in the eye that herald changes in the [[vitreous humour|vitreous]] before the epiretinal membrane forms.\n\n==Treatment==\nSurgeons can remove or peel the membrane through the [[sclera]] and improve vision by 2 or more [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] lines.  Usually the vitreous is replaced at the same time with clear (BSS) fluid, in a [[vitrectomy]].  Surgery is not usually recommended unless the distortions are severe enough to interfere with daily living, since there are the usual hazards of surgery, infections, and a possibility of [[retinal detachment]]. More common complications are high intraocular pressure, bleeding in the eye, and [[cataract]]s, which are the most frequent complication of vitrectomy surgery. Many patients will develop a cataract within the first few years after surgery.  In fact, the visual distortions and [[diplopia]] created by cataracts may sometimes be confused with epiretinal membrane.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThis ocular pathology was first described by Iwanoff in 1865, and it has been shown to occur in about 7% of the population.  It can occur more frequently in the older population with postmortem studies showing it in 2% of those aged 50 years and 20% in those aged 75 years.\n\n==Culture==\nIn 1996, [[Spalding Gray]] (June 5, 1941 &ndash; ca.

The city grew out of the early [[West Slavs|Slavic]] settlement of ''Misni'' inhabited by the [[Glomacze]] tribe and was founded as a [[German town law|German town]] by King [[Henry the Fowler]] in 929.{{sfn|Bachrach|2014|p=327}} In 968, the [[Diocese of Meissen]] was founded, and Meissen became the [[episcopal see]] of a [[bishop]]. The Catholic bishopric was suppressed in 1581 after the diocese accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] (1559), but re-created in 1921 with its seat first at [[Bautzen]] and now at the [[Katholische Hofkirche]] in Dresden. \n\nThe [[Margraviate of Meissen]] was founded in 968 as well, with the city as the capital of the [[List of Margraves of Meissen|Margraves of Meissen]]. A [[market town]] by 1000, Meissen passed to the [[Civitas Schinesghe|Duchy of Poland]] in 1002 under [[Boleslaw I the Brave]], afterwards into hands of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] a few months later and the [[House of Wettin]] in 1089. In 1015 Meissen was besieged by the Poles led by future King [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II]]. \n\nIn 1241 the city was attacked in the [[Mongol raid on Meissen]].  The small Mongol force under [[Orda Khan]] defeated the city's defenders and much of the city was destroyed. The Mongols withdrew from Germany after the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], sparing the region from further destruction.\n\nThe city was at the forefront of the [[Ostsiedlung]], or intensive German settlement of the rural Slavic lands east of the Elbe, and its reception of [[German town law|city rights]] dates to 1332.\n\nThe construction of [[Meissen Cathedral]] was begun in 1260 on the same hill as the [[Albrechtsburg]] castle. The resulting lack of space led to the cathedral being one of the smallest [[cathedral]]s in [[Europe]]. The church is also known as being one of the purest examples of Gothic architecture.\n\nIn 1423 Meissen became capital of the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. In 1464 the capital was moved to [[Dresden]].\n\nIn 1759 the Austrians defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Meissen]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a subcamp of [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] was located in Meissen.<ref>Christine O'Keefe. ''Concentration Camps''. [http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html tartanplace.com]</ref>\n\n==Porcelain==\n[[File:Misnia2.jpg|thumb|Porcelain bells at the Frauenkirche|left]]\nMeissen is famous for the [[Meissen porcelain|manufacture of porcelain]], based on extensive local deposits of china clay ([[kaolin]]) and potter's clay (potter's earth). Meissen porcelain was the first high-quality porcelain to be produced outside of [[the Orient]].\n\nThe first European porcelain was manufactured in Meissen in 1710, when by decree of King [[Augustus II the Strong]] the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Factory (''K\u00f6niglich-Polnische und Kurf\u00fcrstlich-S\u00e4chsische Porzellan-Manufaktur'')<ref>http://www.starcookers.com/magazin/orte-zum-geniessen/meissner-porzellan/</ref> was opened in the Albrechtsburg. In 1861, it was moved to the ''Triebisch'' river valley of Meissen, where the porcelain factory can still be found today. Along with porcelain, other ceramics are also manufactured in the city. In the old town streets, there have been set up numerous porcelain stores, often selling antique Meissen porcelain and sometimes offering repair of broken porcelain. In Meissen and the sourrounding area, several former painters from the manufacture have set up porcelain painting workshops and galleries with their own pieces of porcelain art.\n\n==Main sights==\n[[File:Meissner-dom1.jpg|thumb|Cathedral]]\n[[File:Hohlweg from the bridge to Meissen Castle.jpg|thumb|Hohlweg from the bridge to Meissen Castle]]\nThe Albrechtsburg, the former residence of the [[House of Wettin]], is regarded as being the first castle to be used as a royal residence in the German-speaking world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Built between 1472 and 1525, it is a fine example of late Gothic style. It was redecorated in the 19th century with a range of murals depicting Saxon history. Today the castle is a museum. Nearby is the 13th-century Gothic Meissen Cathedral (''Mei\u00dfner Dom''), whose chapel is one of the most famous burial places of the Wettin family.  The hill on which the castle and the cathedral are built offers a view over the roofs of the old town.\n\nMeissen's historical district is located mostly around the market at the foot of the castle hill. It contains many buildings of [[Renaissance architecture]]. Also imposing is the view from the 57-metre-high tower of the ''Frauenkirche'' (Church of Our Lady), situated in the old market-place. This church, not to be confused with the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], was first mentioned in a 1205 deed issued by Bishop Dietrich II and after a blaze about 1450 rebuilt in the Late Gothic style of a [[hall church]]. Its tower hosts the world's first porcelain carillon, manufactured in 1929 on the occasion of the town's 1000-years-jubilee. Another popular tourist sight is the world-famous Meissen porcelain factory.\n\nFrom spring to autumn, several festivals take place in Meissen, such as the [[pottery]] market or the ''Weinfest'', which celebrates the [[wine]] harvest.

The city grew out of the early [[West Slavs|Slavic]] settlement of ''Misni'' inhabited by the [[Glomacze]] tribe and was founded as a [[German town law|German town]] by King [[Henry the Fowler]] in 929.{{sfn|Bachrach|2014|p=327}} In 968, the [[Diocese of Meissen]] was founded, and Meissen became the [[episcopal see]] of a [[bishop]]. The Catholic bishopric was suppressed in 1581 after the diocese accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] (1559), but re-created in 1921 with its seat first at [[Bautzen]] and now at the [[Katholische Hofkirche]] in Dresden. \n\nThe [[Margraviate of Meissen]] was founded in 968 as well, with the city as the capital of the [[List of Margraves of Meissen|Margraves of Meissen]]. A [[market town]] by 1000, Meissen passed to the [[Civitas Schinesghe|Duchy of Poland]] in 1002 under [[Boleslaw I the Brave]], afterwards into hands of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] a few months later and the [[House of Wettin]] in 1089. In 1015 Meissen was besieged by the Poles led by future King [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II]]. \n\nIn 1241 the city was attacked in the [[Mongol raid on Meissen]].  The small Mongol force under [[Orda Khan]] defeated the city's defenders and much of the city was destroyed. The Mongols withdrew from Germany after the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], sparing the region from further destruction.\n\nThe city was at the forefront of the [[Ostsiedlung]], or intensive German settlement of the rural Slavic lands east of the Elbe, and its reception of [[German town law|city rights]] dates to 1332.\n\nThe construction of [[Meissen Cathedral]] was begun in 1260 on the same hill as the [[Albrechtsburg]] castle. The resulting lack of space led to the cathedral being one of the smallest [[cathedral]]s in [[Europe]]. The church is also known as being one of the purest examples of Gothic architecture.\n\nIn 1423 Meissen became capital of the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. In 1464 the capital was moved to [[Dresden]].\n\nIn 1759 the Austrians defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Meissen]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a subcamp of [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] was located in Meissen.<ref>Christine O'Keefe. ''Concentration Camps''. [http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html tartanplace.com]</ref>\n\n==Porcelain==\n[[File:Misnia2.jpg|thumb|Porcelain bells at the Frauenkirche|left]]\nMeissen is famous for the [[Meissen porcelain|manufacture of porcelain]], based on extensive local deposits of china clay ([[kaolin]]) and potter's clay (potter's earth). Meissen porcelain was the first high-quality porcelain to be produced outside of [[the Orient]].\n\nThe first European porcelain was manufactured in Meissen in 1710, when by decree of King [[Augustus II the Strong]] the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Factory (''K\u00f6niglich-Polnische und Kurf\u00fcrstlich-S\u00e4chsische Porzellan-Manufaktur'')<ref>http://www.starcookers.com/magazin/orte-zum-geniessen/meissner-porzellan/</ref> was opened in the Albrechtsburg. In 1861, it was moved to the ''Triebisch'' river valley of Meissen, where the porcelain factory can still be found today. Along with porcelain, other ceramics are also manufactured in the city. In the old town streets, there have been set up numerous porcelain stores, often selling antique Meissen porcelain and sometimes offering repair of broken porcelain. In Meissen and the sourrounding area, several former painters from the manufacture have set up porcelain painting workshops and galleries with their own pieces of porcelain art.\n\n==Main sights==\n[[File:Meissner-dom1.jpg|thumb|Cathedral]]\n[[File:Hohlweg from the bridge to Meissen Castle.jpg|thumb|Hohlweg from the bridge to Meissen Castle]]\nThe Albrechtsburg, the former residence of the [[House of Wettin]], is regarded as being the first castle to be used as a royal residence in the German-speaking world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Built between 1472 and 1525, it is a fine example of late Gothic style. It was redecorated in the 19th century with a range of murals depicting Saxon history. Today the castle is a museum. Nearby is the 13th-century Gothic Meissen Cathedral (''Mei\u00dfner Dom''), whose chapel is one of the most famous burial places of the Wettin family.  The hill on which the castle and the cathedral are built offers a view over the roofs of the old town.\n\nMeissen's historical district is located mostly around the market at the foot of the castle hill. It contains many buildings of [[Renaissance architecture]]. Also imposing is the view from the 57-metre-high tower of the ''Frauenkirche'' (Church of Our Lady), situated in the old market-place. This church, not to be confused with the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], was first mentioned in a 1205 deed issued by Bishop Dietrich II and after a blaze about 1450 rebuilt in the Late Gothic style of a [[hall church]]. Its tower hosts the world's first porcelain carillon, manufactured in 1929 on the occasion of the town's 1000-years-jubilee. Another popular tourist sight is the world-famous Meissen porcelain factory.\n\nFrom spring to autumn, several festivals take place in Meissen, such as the [[pottery]] market or the ''Weinfest'', which celebrates the [[wine]] harvest. Meissen wine is produced at the [[vineyard]]s in the river valley (''Elbtal'') around the town, part of the [[Saxony (wine region)|Saxonian wine region]], one of the northernmost in Europe.\n\n==Notable residents==\n[[File:Meissen Postmeilensaeule.jpg|thumb|Polish-Saxon post milestone]]\n*[[Adam of Bremen]], author of the ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'' (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church), believed to have been born here before 1050.\n*[[Benno|Saint Benno]], [[Bishop of Meissen]], born about 1010 in [[Hildesheim]], died June 16, 1106\n*[[Heinrich Frauenlob]], poet, born 1250/60, died November 29, 1318 in [[Mainz]]\n*[[Samuel Hahnemann]] (1755\u20131843), physician and founder of [[Homoeopathy]]\n*[[Johann Klaj]] (1616&ndash;1656 in [[Kitzingen]])\n*[[Karl G.

Alternative names for rat-bite fever include streptobacillary fever, streptobacillosis, spirillary fever, bogger, and epidemic arthritic erythema. It is a rare disease spread by infected rodents and can be caused by two specific types of bacteria. Most cases occur in Japan, but specific strains of the disease are present in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa.\nSome cases are diagnosed after patients were exposed to the urine or bodily secretions of an infected animal. These [[secretion]]s can come from the mouth, nose, or eyes of the rodent. The majority of cases are due to the animal's bite. It can also be transmitted through food or water contaminated with rat feces or urine.  Other animals can be infected with this disease, including weasels, gerbils, and squirrels. Household pets such as dogs or cats exposed to these animals can also carry the disease and infect humans.\nIf a person is bitten by a rodent, it is important to quickly wash and cleanse the wound area thoroughly with antiseptic solution to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n==Symptoms==\nSymptoms are different for every person depending on the type of rat-bite fever with which the person is infected. Both [[spirillum|spirillary]] and streptobacillary rat-bite fever have a few individual symptoms, although most symptoms are shared. Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary rat-bite fever is generally diagnosed in patients in Africa. Rat-bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open [[Ulcer (dermatology)|sore]]. A [[rash]] can also spread around the area and appear red or purple.<ref>[http://rat-bitefever.com/ Rat Bite Fever] Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary rat-bite fever include [[chills]], [[fever]], vomiting, headaches, and muscle aches. Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the back. Skin irritations such as [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet. Wounds heal slowly, so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months.\n\nSymptoms associated with spirillary rat-bite fever include issues with the [[lymph node]]s, which often swell or become inflamed as a reaction to the infection. The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck, groin, and underarm.<ref>[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/swollen_lymph_nodes.htm Swollen Lymph Nodes] Wrong Diagnosis Portal. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> Symptoms generally appear within 2 to 10 days of exposure to the infected animal. It begins with the fever and progresses to the rash on the hands and feet within 2 to 4 days. Rash appears all over the body with this form, but rarely causes joint pain.\n\n==Causes==\nTwo types of [[Gram-negative]], [[facultative anaerobe|facultatively anaerobic]] bacteria can cause the infection.\n\n===Spirillosis===\n{{Main|Sodoku}}\nRat-bite fever transmitted by the Gram-negative coiled rod ''[[Spirillum minus]]'' (also known as ''Spirillum minor'') is more rare, and is found most often in Asia. In Japan, the disease is called ''[[sodoku]]''. Symptoms do not manifest for two to four weeks after exposure to the organism, and the wound through which it entered exhibits slow healing and marked [[inflammation]]. The fever lasts longer and is recurring, for months in some cases. Rectal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms are less severe or are absent. Penicillin is the most common treatment.\n\n===Streptobacillosis===\n{{Main|Haverhill fever}}\nThe streptobacillosis form of rat-bite fever is known by the alternative names [[Haverhill fever]] and epidemic arthritic erythema. It is a severe disease caused by ''[[Streptobacillus moniliformis]]'', transmitted either by rat bite or ingestion of contaminated products (Haverhill fever).  After an incubation period of 2\u201310 days, Haverhill fever begins with high prostrating fevers, [[Rigor (medicine)|rigors]] (shivering), headache, and [[polyarthralgia]] (joint pain).  Soon, an [[exanthem]] (widespread rash) appears, either [[maculopapular]] (flat red with bumps) or [[petechial]] (red or purple spots) and arthritis of large joints can be seen.  The organism can be cultivated in blood or articular fluid.  The disease can be fatal if untreated in 20% of cases due to malignant endocarditis, meningoencephalitis, or septic shock.  Treatment is with penicillin, tetracycline, or doxycycline.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThis condition is diagnosed by detecting the bacteria in skin, blood, joint fluid, or lymph nodes. Blood antibody tests may also be used.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001348|Rat-bite fever}}</ref> To get a proper diagnosis for rat-bite fever, different tests are run depending on the symptoms being experienced.\n\nTo diagnosis streptobacillary rat-bite fever, blood or joint fluid is extracted and the organisms living in it are cultured. Diagnosis for spirillary rat bite fever is by direct visualization or culture of spirilla from blood smears or tissue from lesions or lymph nodes.<ref>{{MerckManual|14|174|e||Rat Bite Fever Spirochetes}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nWhile obviously preventable by staying away from rodents, otherwise hands and face should be washed after contact and any scratches both cleaned and antiseptics applied. The effect of chemoprophylaxis following rodent bites or scratches on the disease is unknown. No vaccines are available for these diseases.\nImproved conditions to minimize rodent contact with humans are the best preventive measures. Animal handlers, laboratory workers, and sanitation and sewer workers must take special precautions against exposure. Wild rodents, dead or alive, should not be touched and pets must not be allowed to ingest rodents.\nThose living in the [[inner city|inner cities]] where overcrowding and poor sanitation cause rodent problems are at risk from the disease. Half of all cases reported are children under 12 living in these conditions.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment with antibiotics is the same for both types of infection. The condition responds to [[penicillin]], and where allergies to it occur, [[erythromycin]] or [[tetracyclines]] are used.\n\n==Prognosis==\nWhen proper treatment is provided for patients with rat-bite fever, the [[prognosis]] is positive. Without treatment, the infection usually resolves on its own, although it may take up to a year to do so.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Streptobacillary+Fever Rat Bite Fever Overview] Medical Dictionary Portal. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> A particular strain of rat-bite fever in the United States can progress and cause serious complications that can be potentially fatal. Before [[antibiotic]]s were used, many cases resulted in death. If left untreated, streptobacillary rat-bite fever can result in infection in the lining of the heart, covering over the spinal cord and brain, or in the lungs.

Alternative names for rat-bite fever include streptobacillary fever, streptobacillosis, spirillary fever, bogger, and epidemic arthritic erythema. It is a rare disease spread by infected rodents and can be caused by two specific types of bacteria. Most cases occur in Japan, but specific strains of the disease are present in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa.\nSome cases are diagnosed after patients were exposed to the urine or bodily secretions of an infected animal. These [[secretion]]s can come from the mouth, nose, or eyes of the rodent. The majority of cases are due to the animal's bite. It can also be transmitted through food or water contaminated with rat feces or urine.  Other animals can be infected with this disease, including weasels, gerbils, and squirrels. Household pets such as dogs or cats exposed to these animals can also carry the disease and infect humans.\nIf a person is bitten by a rodent, it is important to quickly wash and cleanse the wound area thoroughly with antiseptic solution to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n==Symptoms==\nSymptoms are different for every person depending on the type of rat-bite fever with which the person is infected. Both [[spirillum|spirillary]] and streptobacillary rat-bite fever have a few individual symptoms, although most symptoms are shared. Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary rat-bite fever is generally diagnosed in patients in Africa. Rat-bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open [[Ulcer (dermatology)|sore]]. A [[rash]] can also spread around the area and appear red or purple.<ref>[http://rat-bitefever.com/ Rat Bite Fever] Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary rat-bite fever include [[chills]], [[fever]], vomiting, headaches, and muscle aches. Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the back. Skin irritations such as [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet. Wounds heal slowly, so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months.\n\nSymptoms associated with spirillary rat-bite fever include issues with the [[lymph node]]s, which often swell or become inflamed as a reaction to the infection. The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck, groin, and underarm.<ref>[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/swollen_lymph_nodes.htm Swollen Lymph Nodes] Wrong Diagnosis Portal. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> Symptoms generally appear within 2 to 10 days of exposure to the infected animal. It begins with the fever and progresses to the rash on the hands and feet within 2 to 4 days. Rash appears all over the body with this form, but rarely causes joint pain.\n\n==Causes==\nTwo types of [[Gram-negative]], [[facultative anaerobe|facultatively anaerobic]] bacteria can cause the infection.\n\n===Spirillosis===\n{{Main|Sodoku}}\nRat-bite fever transmitted by the Gram-negative coiled rod ''[[Spirillum minus]]'' (also known as ''Spirillum minor'') is more rare, and is found most often in Asia. In Japan, the disease is called ''[[sodoku]]''. Symptoms do not manifest for two to four weeks after exposure to the organism, and the wound through which it entered exhibits slow healing and marked [[inflammation]]. The fever lasts longer and is recurring, for months in some cases. Rectal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms are less severe or are absent. Penicillin is the most common treatment.\n\n===Streptobacillosis===\n{{Main|Haverhill fever}}\nThe streptobacillosis form of rat-bite fever is known by the alternative names [[Haverhill fever]] and epidemic arthritic erythema. It is a severe disease caused by ''[[Streptobacillus moniliformis]]'', transmitted either by rat bite or ingestion of contaminated products (Haverhill fever).  After an incubation period of 2\u201310 days, Haverhill fever begins with high prostrating fevers, [[Rigor (medicine)|rigors]] (shivering), headache, and [[polyarthralgia]] (joint pain).  Soon, an [[exanthem]] (widespread rash) appears, either [[maculopapular]] (flat red with bumps) or [[petechial]] (red or purple spots) and arthritis of large joints can be seen.  The organism can be cultivated in blood or articular fluid.  The disease can be fatal if untreated in 20% of cases due to malignant endocarditis, meningoencephalitis, or septic shock.  Treatment is with penicillin, tetracycline, or doxycycline.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThis condition is diagnosed by detecting the bacteria in skin, blood, joint fluid, or lymph nodes. Blood antibody tests may also be used.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001348|Rat-bite fever}}</ref> To get a proper diagnosis for rat-bite fever, different tests are run depending on the symptoms being experienced.\n\nTo diagnosis streptobacillary rat-bite fever, blood or joint fluid is extracted and the organisms living in it are cultured. Diagnosis for spirillary rat bite fever is by direct visualization or culture of spirilla from blood smears or tissue from lesions or lymph nodes.<ref>{{MerckManual|14|174|e||Rat Bite Fever Spirochetes}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nWhile obviously preventable by staying away from rodents, otherwise hands and face should be washed after contact and any scratches both cleaned and antiseptics applied. The effect of chemoprophylaxis following rodent bites or scratches on the disease is unknown. No vaccines are available for these diseases.\nImproved conditions to minimize rodent contact with humans are the best preventive measures. Animal handlers, laboratory workers, and sanitation and sewer workers must take special precautions against exposure. Wild rodents, dead or alive, should not be touched and pets must not be allowed to ingest rodents.\nThose living in the [[inner city|inner cities]] where overcrowding and poor sanitation cause rodent problems are at risk from the disease. Half of all cases reported are children under 12 living in these conditions.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment with antibiotics is the same for both types of infection. The condition responds to [[penicillin]], and where allergies to it occur, [[erythromycin]] or [[tetracyclines]] are used.\n\n==Prognosis==\nWhen proper treatment is provided for patients with rat-bite fever, the [[prognosis]] is positive. Without treatment, the infection usually resolves on its own, although it may take up to a year to do so.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Streptobacillary+Fever Rat Bite Fever Overview] Medical Dictionary Portal. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> A particular strain of rat-bite fever in the United States can progress and cause serious complications that can be potentially fatal. Before [[antibiotic]]s were used, many cases resulted in death. If left untreated, streptobacillary rat-bite fever can result in infection in the lining of the heart, covering over the spinal cord and brain, or in the lungs.

LimeWire also now includes [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] support, but is limited to three torrent uploads and three torrent downloads, which coexist with ordinary downloads. LimeWire 5.0 added an instant messenger that uses the [[XMPP]] Protocol, an open source communication protocol.

This has stopped people from illegally downloading the \"Pro\" versions. However, there are still ways to bypass this security feature, which was done when creating the pirate edition. For example, there are currently cracks available on the internet, and people can continue using the LimeWire Pro 5.5.1 Beta, which also includes [[AVG (software)|AVG]] for LimeWire and is the first version to include AVG. The most recent stable version of LimeWire is 5.5.16.\n\nVersions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.10 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11, however, do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional.

LimeWire also now includes [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] support, but is limited to three torrent uploads and three torrent downloads, which coexist with ordinary downloads. LimeWire 5.0 added an instant messenger that uses the [[XMPP]] Protocol, an open source communication protocol. Users can now chat and share files with individuals or a group of friends in their buddy list.\n[[File:Limewire 5 0 11 beta.png|thumb|A screenshot of Limewire 5 0 11 beta\n]]\nFrom version 5.5.1, LimeWire has added a key activation, which requires the user to enter the unique key before activating the \"Pro\" version of the software. This has stopped people from illegally downloading the \"Pro\" versions. However, there are still ways to bypass this security feature, which was done when creating the pirate edition. For example, there are currently cracks available on the internet, and people can continue using the LimeWire Pro 5.5.1 Beta, which also includes [[AVG (software)|AVG]] for LimeWire and is the first version to include AVG. The most recent stable version of LimeWire is 5.5.16.\n\nVersions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.10 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11, however, do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional. As a result, neither the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) nor Lime Wire LLC have the ability to disable older versions of LimeWire, unless the user chooses to upgrade to a newer version of LimeWire.<ref name=\"pcmag2\" />\n[[File:Limewire2008.PNG|thumb|Limewire 2008]]\nOn November 10, 2010, a secret group of developers called the \"Secret Dev Team\" sought to keep the application working by releasing the \"LimeWire Pirate Edition\".<ref name=\"Limewire Info\">{{cite web|url=http://limewireinfo.com/limewire-brought-back-to-life-by-secret-dev-team/|title=Limewire Brought Back to Life by Secret Dev Team|date=November 21, 2010|work=Limewire Info|accessdate=November 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302093249/http://limewireinfo.com/limewire-brought-back-to-life-by-secret-dev-team/|archive-date=March 2, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The software is based on LimeWire 5.6 Beta, and is aimed to allow Windows versions to still work and remove the threat of spyware or adware.
