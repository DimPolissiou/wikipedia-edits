''Fish Stew'') is a [[Serbia]]n and [[SFRY|Yugoslav]] [[rock (music)|rock]] band from [[Belgrade]]. The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav rock scene]].\n\nRiblja \u010corba was formed in 1978 by vocalist [[Bora \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], guitarist [[Rajko Koji\u0107]], bass guitarist [[Mi\u0161a Aleksi\u0107]] and drummer [[Vicko Milatovi\u0107]]. Their debut release, the single \"[[Lutka sa naslovne strane]]\" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107|Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\"]], the new lineup releasing the album ''[[Kost u grlu]]'' (1979), which was, largely due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's social-related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, ''[[Pokvarena ma\u0161ta i prljave strasti]]'' (1981), ''[[Mrtva priroda]]'' (1981) and ''[[Buvlja pijaca]]'' (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album ''[[Istina]]'' (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, [[Vidoja Bo\u017einovi\u0107|Vidoja \"D\u017eind\u017eer\" Bo\u017einovi\u0107]] and [[Nikola \u010cuturilo]]. Until the end of the decade and [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of [[Yugoslav wars]] it heavily declined in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's support for [[Serbian nationalism]]. However, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 also opposed the regime of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja \u010corba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the [[Serbian rock|Serbian rock scene]], although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success.\n\n==Band history==\n\n===1970s: Formation and immediate rise to fame===\n[[File:Gallery 1982-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The 1979\u20141984 Riblja \u010corba lineup, from left to right:

''Fish Stew'') is a [[Serbia]]n and [[SFRY|Yugoslav]] [[rock (music)|rock]] band from [[Belgrade]]. The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav rock scene]].\n\nRiblja \u010corba was formed in 1978 by vocalist [[Bora \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], guitarist [[Rajko Koji\u0107]], bass guitarist [[Mi\u0161a Aleksi\u0107]] and drummer [[Vicko Milatovi\u0107]]. Their debut release, the single \"[[Lutka sa naslovne strane]]\" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107|Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\"]], the new lineup releasing the album ''[[Kost u grlu]]'' (1979), which was, largely due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's social-related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, ''[[Pokvarena ma\u0161ta i prljave strasti]]'' (1981), ''[[Mrtva priroda]]'' (1981) and ''[[Buvlja pijaca]]'' (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album ''[[Istina]]'' (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, [[Vidoja Bo\u017einovi\u0107|Vidoja \"D\u017eind\u017eer\" Bo\u017einovi\u0107]] and [[Nikola \u010cuturilo]]. Until the end of the decade and [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of [[Yugoslav wars]] it heavily declined in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's support for [[Serbian nationalism]]. However, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 also opposed the regime of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja \u010corba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the [[Serbian rock|Serbian rock scene]], although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success.\n\n==Band history==\n\n===1970s: Formation and immediate rise to fame===\n[[File:Gallery 1982-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The 1979\u20141984 Riblja \u010corba lineup, from left to right:

on guitar.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> In the early 1970s, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 played in [[Belgrade]]'s [[Atelje 212]] production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and started his studies of theatre organization on the [[University of Arts in Belgrade#Faculty of Dramatic Arts|Belgrade Faculty of Dramatic Arts]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> At the same time, he formed the [[acoustic rock]] band Zajedno (''Together''), with which he recorded two [[7\" single]]s, the single \"Vizija\" (\"Vision\") bringing them certain media attention, and started contributing to [[Radio Belgrade]] show ''Ve\u010de uz radio'' (''Evening by the Radio'') and music magazine ''[[D\u017euboks]]'', usually with reports on acoustic rock scene.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> In 1975, he left Zajedno, forming the acoustic band [[Suncokret]], which soon gained media attention and popularity with their humorous [[folk rock]]-oriented songs.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 spent three years in Suncokret, releasing the album ''Moje bube'' (''My Bugs'') and five 7\" singles with the band.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> He decided to leave Suncokret in 1978, after the band refused to perform his new song, \"[[Lutka sa naslovne strane]]\" (\"Doll from the Front Cover\"), a [[Ballad#Pop and rock ballads|ballad]] about a fame-hungry model, claiming the song does not fit into the band's style.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> Another Suncokret member, [[Biljana Krsti\u0107]], decided to leave the band with \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, and the two joined the [[pop rock]] band [[Rani Mraz]], led by [[\u0110or\u0111e Bala\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107191\"/> \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, Bala\u0161evi\u0107, Krsti\u0107 and Verica Todorovi\u0107 would

Festival]] held in [[Novi Sad]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> On December 22, they released their first single, \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\", which became an immediate hit.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> The song featured [[jazz]] [[trumpeter]] [[Stjepko Gut]] on [[piano]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/>\n\nAfter the single release, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 decided to leave acoustic guitar and dedicate himself to singing, and the members of the band considered adding a keyboardist to the lineup, but eventually decided to hire a rhythm guitarist.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> The band's new member became [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107]], at the time a high school student.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> He was recommended by Koji\u0107, who previously played with Bajagi\u0107 in the band Glogov Kolac (''Wooden Stake'').<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> This lineup held its first concert on January 7, 1979 in [[Jarkovac]]; in the first part of the concert the band performed covers, and in the second part they performed their own songs, with Bajagi\u0107 playing in the second part only.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> On February 28, they held a long promoted concert in [[Belgrade]]'s [[Dom omladine Beograda|Youth Center]], which was the band's first concert in Belgrade.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> The concert featured [[ballerinas]], students of former [[prima ballerina]] Minka Kamberovi\u0107, and during the performance of \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\" \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 broke a [[mannequin]] to pieces.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> During that concert, Riblja \u010corba played most of the songs which would be released on their first album.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> At the beginning of March, the band held several concerts in [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], gaining new fans.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> Bajagi\u0107, still a high school student, managed to skip school by telling his teachers that he will be absent due to [[appendectomy]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> However, he got into trouble after one of the teachers saw a report on the tour in ''[[Politikin Zabavnik]]'' magazine, but ended up without suffering serious consequences.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> After, on the band's concert in [[Dolovo (Pan\u010devo)|Dolovo]], Aleksi\u0107 fell from the stage and broke his leg, he was replaced by Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107 (who would later become a member of Bajagi\u0107's band [[Bajaga i Instruktori]]) for the band's concerts in [[Sand\u017eak]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> On these concerts, Cvetkovi\u0107 also sang in the covers of foreign hits.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> On March 19, 1979, Riblja \u010corba released their second single with the songs \"[[Rock 'n' Roll za ku\u0107ni savet]]\" (\"Rock 'n' Roll for Residents' Committee\") and [[Rock 'n' Roll za ku\u0107ni savet|\"Valentino iz restorana\"]] (\"Restaurant [[Rudolph Valentino|Valentino]]\").<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> The lyrics for \"Valentino iz restorana\", with which the band appeared at the [[Opatija]] Festival, were co-written by \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 and [[Marina Tucakovi\u0107]], which was the only time in the history of the band that the author of the lyrics was someone outside the band.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/>\n\nRiblja \u010corba spent the summer in [[Makarska]], where they practiced for the upcoming promotion of their debut album.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> The concert was held on September 1 on Belgrade's [[Ta\u0161majdan Sports Centre#Ta\u0161majdan Stadium|Ta\u0161majdan Stadium]].<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> Although the album was at the time still unreleased, the stadium was sold out, thanks to large media attention and low ticket prices.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> [[Bulevar (band)|Bulevar]] and [[Formula 4 (band)|Formula 4]] performed as the opening bands.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> Riblja \u010corba played all the songs which would be released on their debut album, the songs released on their 7\" singles, and the covers of [[Joe Cocker]]'s version of \"[[The Letter (The Box Tops song)|The Letter]]\" and [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\".<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> A huge surprise for the band members and the media was the fact that the audience knew all the lyrics; it was later revealed that the fans were recording \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's radio interviews, during which parts of the songs were broadcast.<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> This was the concert on which \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, thanks to his stage charisma, got his concert nickname Bora Majstor (''Bora the Master'').<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> Meri Caki\u0107's \"anti-ballet\" group Ribetine (''Chicks'') also performed at the concert (Meri Caki\u0107, who appeared on the concert wearing [[garter belts]], has, by some claims, inspired \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 to write \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\", although he denied the claims).<ref name=\"janjatovi\u0107192\"/> Several days later, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107

He was also, as '''Philip II''', [[King of Portugal]], [[King of Naples|Naples]], [[King of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[King of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Duke of Milan]] from 1598 until his death in 1621.\n\nA member of the [[House of Habsburg]], Philip III was born in [[Madrid]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]] and his fourth wife and niece [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)|Anna]], the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and [[Maria of Spain]]. Philip III later married his cousin [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]], sister of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nAlthough also known in Spain as '''Philip the Pious''',<ref>Stradling, p. 9.</ref> Philip's political reputation abroad has been largely negative \u2013 an 'undistinguished and insignificant man,' a 'miserable monarch,' whose 'only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice,' to quote historians C. V. Wedgwood, R. Stradling and J. H. Elliott.<ref>Wedgwood, p. 55; Stradling, p. 18; Elliott, 1963, pp. 300\u2013301.</ref> In particular, Philip's reliance on his corrupt chief minister, the [[Francisco Gom\u00e9z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]], drew much criticism at the time and afterwards. For many, the decline of Spain can be dated to the economic difficulties that set in during the early years of his reign. Nonetheless, as the ruler of the [[Spanish Empire]] at its height and as the king who achieved a [[Twelve Years' Truce|temporary peace]] with the Dutch (1609\u20131621) and brought Spain into the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) through an (initially) extremely successful campaign, Philip's reign remains a critical period in Spanish history.\n\n==big pp==\nAfter Philip III's older brother [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Carlos]] died insane, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] had concluded that one of the causes of Carlos' condition had been the influence of the warring factions at the Spanish court.<ref name=\"Feros, p.16\">Feros, p.16.</ref> He believed that Carlos' education and upbringing had been badly affected by this, resulting in his lunacy and disobedience, and accordingly he set out to pay much greater attention to arrangements for his later sons.<ref name=\"Feros, p.16\"/> Philip II appointed Juan de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, then [[Diego, Prince of Asturias|Prince Diego]]'s governor, to continue this role for Philip, and chose Garc\u00eda de Loaysa as his tutor.<ref name=\"Feros, p.16\"/> They were joined by Crist\u00f3bal de Moura, a close supporter of Philip II. In combination, Philip believed, they would provide a consistent, stable upbringing for Prince Philip, and ensure he avoided the same fate as Carlos.<ref name=\"Feros, p.17\">Feros, p.17.</ref> Philip's education was to follow the model for royal princes laid down by Father [[Juan de Mariana]], focusing on the imposition of restraints and encouragement to form the personality of the individual at an early age, aiming to deliver a king who was neither tyrannical nor excessively under the influence of his courtiers.<ref name=\"Feros, p.17\"/>\n[[File:3157 Print 14632kopie.jpg|thumb|Philip III of Spain, 1599-1601, The Phoebus Foundation]]\nPrince Philip appears to have been generally liked by his contemporaries: 'dynamic, good-natured and earnest,' suitably pious, having a 'lively body and a peaceful disposition,' albeit with a relatively weak constitution.<ref name=\"Feros, p.19\">Feros, p.19.</ref> The comparison with the memory of the disobedient and ultimately insane Carlos was usually a positive one, although some commented that Prince Philip appeared less intelligent and politically competent than his late brother.<ref name=\"Feros, p.19\"/> Indeed, although Philip was educated in [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[astronomy]], and appears to have been a competent linguist,<ref name=\"Feros, p.17\"/> recent historians suspect that much of his tutors' focus on Philip's undeniably pleasant, pious and respectful disposition was to avoid reporting that, languages aside, he was not in fact particularly intelligent or academically gifted.<ref name=\"Williams, p.38\">Williams, p.38.</ref> Nonetheless, Philip does not appear to have been naive \u2013 his correspondence to his daughters shows a distinctive cautious streak in his advice on dealing with court intrigue.<ref>S\u00e1nchez, p.101.</ref>\n\nPhilip first met the [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Marquis of Denia]] \u2013 the future Duke of Lerma \u2013 then, a gentleman of the King's chamber, in his early teens.<ref name=\"Williams, p.38\"/> Lerma and Philip became close friends, but Lerma was considered unsuitable by the King and Philip's tutors. Lerma was dispatched to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] as a [[Viceroy]] in 1595, with the aim of removing Philip from his influence;<ref name=\"Williams, p.38\"/> but after Lerma pleaded poor health, he was allowed to return two years later. By now in poor health himself, King Philip II was becoming increasingly concerned over the prince's future, and he attempted to establish de Moura as a future, trusted advisor to his son, reinforcing de Loaysa's position by appointing him [[archbishop]].<ref name=\"Williams, p.39\">Williams, p.39.</ref> The prince received a new, conservative [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] confessor.<ref name=\"Williams, p.39\"/> The following year, Philip II died after a painful illness, leaving the [[Spanish Empire]] to his son (and grandnephew), King Philip III.\n\n==Religion, Philip and the role of women at court==\nPhilip married his cousin, [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Margaret of Austria]], on 18 April 1599, a year after becoming king. Margaret, the sister of the future [[Emperor Ferdinand II]], would be one of three women at Philip's court who would apply considerable influence over the king.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.91\">S\u00e1nchez, p.91.</ref> Margaret was considered by contemporaries to be extremely pious \u2013 in some cases, excessively pious, and too influenced by the Church<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.98\">S\u00e1nchez, p.98.</ref> \u2013 'astute and very skillful' in her political dealings,<ref>S\u00e1nchez, p.99.</ref> although 'melancholic' and unhappy over the influence of the Duke of Lerma over her husband at court.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.98\"/> Margaret continued to fight an ongoing battle with Lerma for influence up until her death in 1611. Philip had an 'affectionate, close relationship' with Margaret,<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.100\">S\u00e1nchez, p.100.</ref> and paid her additional attention after she bore him a son in 1605.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.100\"/>\n\nMargaret, alongside Philip's grandmother/aunt, [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Empress Maria]] \u2013 the Austrian representative to the Spanish court \u2013 and [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria (1567\u20131633)|Margaret of the Cross]], Maria's daughter \u2013 formed a powerful, uncompromising [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and pro-Austrian voice within Philip's life.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.91\"/> They were successful, for example, in convincing Philip to provide financial support to Ferdinand from 1600 onwards.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.100\"/> Philip steadily acquired other religious advisors. Father Juan de Santa Maria \u2013 confessor to Philip's daughter, [[Don (honorific)|do\u00f1a]] [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria]], was felt by contemporaries to have an excessive influence over Philip at the end of his life,<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.97\">S\u00e1nchez, p.97.</ref> and both he and Luis de Aliaga, Philip's own [[confessor]], were credited with influencing the overthrow of Lerma in 1618. Similarly Mariana de San Jose, a favoured nun of Queen Margaret's, was also criticised for her later influence over the King's actions.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.97\"/>\n\n==Style of government==\n[[File:Felipe3-Spain.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip III of Spain]]\n\nThe Spanish crown at the time ruled through a system of royal councils. The most significant of these were the Councils of State and its subordinate Council for War, that were in turn supported by the seven professional councils for the different regions, and four specialised councils for the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the [[Military order (society)|Military Orders]], Finance and the [[Papal income tax|Crusade tax]].<ref>Williams, p.35.</ref> These councils were then supplemented by small committees, or ''juntas'', as necessary, such as the 'junta of the night' through which Philip II exercised personal authority towards the end of his reign.<ref name=\"Williams, p.34\">Williams, p.34.</ref> As a matter of policy, Philip had tried to avoid appointing grandees to major positions of power within his government and relied heavily on the lesser nobles, the so-called 'service' nobility.<ref name=\"Williams, p.34\"/> Philip II had taken the traditional system of councils and applied a high degree of personal scrutiny to them, especially in matters of paperwork, which he declined to delegate \u2013 the result was a 'ponderous' process.<ref>Munck, p.49.</ref> To his contemporaries, the degree of personal oversight he exercised was excessive; his 'self-imposed role as the chief clerk to the Spanish empire'<ref>Mattingly, p.74.</ref> was not thought entirely appropriate. Philip first started to become engaged in practical government at the age of 15, when he joined Philip II's private committee.<ref name=\"Feros, p.19\"/>\n\nPhilip III's approach to government appears to have stemmed from three main drivers. Firstly, he was heavily influenced by the [[Irenicism|eirenic]] ideas being circulated in Italian circles in reaction to the new [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] theories of governance, typified by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]].<ref>Tuck, p.121.</ref> Writers such as Girolamo Frachetta, who became a particular favourite of Philip, had propagated a conservative definition of 'reason of state' which centred on exercising a princely prudence and a strict obedience to the laws and customs of the country that one ruled.<ref>Tuck, p.122.</ref> Secondly, Philip may have shared Lerma's view that the governmental system of Philip II was fast proving impractical and unnecessarily excluded the great nobles of the kingdoms \u2013 it had been creaking badly in the last decades of his father's life.<ref>Williams, pp.47\u20138.</ref> Lastly, Philip's own personality and his friendship with Lerma heavily shaped his approach to policy-making. The result was a radical shift in the role of the crown in government from the model of Philip II.\n\n===Duke of Lerma as ''valido''===\n[[File:Retrato ecuestre del duque de Lerma (Rubens).jpg|thumb|left|''Francisco Gom\u00e9z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma,'' [[Spain|Spanish]] statesman]]\n\nWithin a few hours of Philip ascending to the throne, [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]] had been made a royal counsellor by the new king and set about establishing himself as a fully fledged ''[[Favourite|valido]]'', or royal favourite.<ref>Williams, p.42.</ref> Lerma, in due course declared a duke, positioned himself as the gateway to the king. All the business of government, Philip instructed, was to arrive in writing and be channeled through Lerma before reaching him.<ref>Feros, p.112.</ref> Whilst Philip was not hugely active in government in other ways, once these memoranda, or ''consulta'', had reached him he appears to have been assiduous in commenting on them.<ref name=\"Williams, p.104\">Williams, p.104.</ref> Debates in royal councils would now only begin upon the written instruction of the king \u2013 again, through Lerma.<ref name=\"Feros, p.113\">Feros, p.113.</ref> All members of royal councils were under orders to maintain complete transparency with Lerma as the king's personal representative;<ref name=\"Feros, p.113\"/> indeed, in 1612 the councils were ordered by Philip to obey Lerma as if he were the king.<ref name=\"Williams, p.104\"/> The degree to which Lerma himself played an active role in government has been disputed. Contemporaries were inclined to see Lerma's hand in every action of government; others have since thought Lerma to have 'neither the temperament nor the energy' to impose himself greatly on the actions of government;<ref>Williams, p.105.</ref> still others consider Lerma to have carefully attended only those Councils of State that addressed matters of great importance to the king,<ref name=\"Feros, p.110\">Feros, p.110.</ref> creating a space for the wider professionalisation of government that had been lacking under Philip II.<ref>Williams, p.9.</ref>\n\nThis new system of government became increasingly unpopular very quickly. The novel idea of a ''[[Favourite|valido]]'' exercising power went against the long-standing popular conception that the king should exercise his powers personally, not through another.<ref>Feros, pp.117\u20138.</ref> Before long, the apparatus of the Spanish government was packed with Lerma's relatives, Lerma's servants and Lerma's political friends, to the exclusion of others.<ref>Feros, p.133.</ref> Lerma responded by further limiting his public visibility in politics, avoiding signing and writing documents personally,<ref name=\"Williams, p.10\">Williams, p.10.</ref> and constantly stressing that he was, humbly, only working on behalf of his master, Philip III.\n\n===Imperial proconsuls===\n[[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|De Lerma]]'s role as royal favourite at court was further complicated by the rise of various '[[proconsul]]s' under Philip III's reign \u2013 significant Spanish representatives overseas, who came to exercise independent judgement and even independent policies in the absence of strong leadership from the centre.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p.127\">Polisensky, p.127.</ref> The challenges to government communication during the period encouraged aspects of this, but the phenomenon was much more marked under Philip III than under either the reign of his father or son.\n\n[[File:Studio of Peter Paul Rubens - Marquis Ambrogio Spinola.jpg|thumb|[[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrosio Spinola]], one of Philip III's various imperial [[proconsul]]s, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]\n\nIn the Netherlands, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] had bequeathed his remaining territories in the Low Countries to his daughter [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella of Spain]] and her husband, [[Archduke Albert of Austria (1559-1621)|Archduke Albert]], under the condition that if she died without heirs, the province would return to the Spanish Crown. Given that Isabella was notoriously childless, it was clear that this was only intended to be a temporary measure, and that Philip II had envisaged an early revision to Philip III.<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.55\">Wedgwood, p.55.</ref> As a result, Philip's foreign policy in the Netherlands would be exercised through the strong-willed Archdukes, but in the knowledge that ultimately the [[Spanish Netherlands]] would return to him as king.<ref>In reality, the Archdukes outlived Philip, resulting in the reunification occurring under his son, Philip IV.</ref> Meanwhile, the Italian-born [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrosio Spinola]] was to perform a crucial role as a Spanish general in the [[Army of Flanders]]. Having demonstrated his military prowess at the [[siege of Ostend]] in 1603, Spinola rapidly started to propose and implement policies almost independently of the central councils in Madrid,<ref>Williams, p.127.</ref> somehow managing to achieve military victories even without central funding from Spain.<ref>Williams, p.128.</ref> De Lerma was uncertain of how to deal with Spinola; on the one hand, de Lerma desperately needed a successful military commander in the Netherlands \u2013 on the other, de Lerma was contemptuous of Spinola's relatively low origins and scared of his potential to destabilise de Lerma at court.<ref>Williams, pp.126\u20137.</ref> In the years leading to the outbreak of war in 1618, Spinola was working to produce a plan to finally defeat the Dutch, involving an intervention in the Rhineland followed by fresh hostilities aiming to cut the Low Countries in two: portrayed at the time as the 'spider in the web' of Catholic politics in the region, Spinola was operating without significant consultation with Philip in Madrid.<ref name=\"Wedgwood, pp.113-4\">Wedgwood, pp.113\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn Italy, a parallel situation emerged. The [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Count of Fuentes]], as governor of [[Lombardy]], exploited the lack of guidance from Madrid to pursue his own highly interventionist policy across north Italy, including making independent offers to support the Papacy by invading the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] in 1607.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.153-4.</ref> Fuentes remained in power and pursuing his own policies until his death. The [[Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca|Marquis of Villafranca]], as governor of [[Milan]], similarly exercised his own considerable judgement on foreign policy. The [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Duke of Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], who had married into the Sandovel family as a close ally of Lerma, again showed significant independence as the Viceroy of Naples towards the end of Philip's reign. In conjunction with the Spanish ambassador to Venice, the influential [[Alfonso de la Cueva, marqu\u00e9s de Bedmar|Marquis of Bedmar]], Osuna pursued a policy of raising an extensive army, intercepting Venetian shipping and imposing sufficiently high taxes that threats of a revolt began to emerge. To exacerbate matters, Osuna was found to have prevented the local Neapolitans from petitioning Philip III to complain.<ref name=\"Williams, p.245\">Williams, p.245.</ref> Osuna fell from power only when de Lerma had lost his royal favour, and Osuna's negative impact on Philip's plans for intervention in Germany had become intolerable.<ref name=\"Williams, p.245\"/>\n\n===Fall of Lerma===\n[[File:Rodrigo calderon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n]], executed by Philip III to satisfy the [[Duke of Lerma]]'s enemies, painted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]\n\nFrom 1612 onwards, and certainly by 1617, the [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]] administration was crumbling. The monopoly of power in the hands of the Lerma's Sandoval family had generated numerous enemies; Lerma's personal enrichment in office had become a scandal; Lerma's extravagant spending and personal debts was beginning to alarm his own son, [[Crist\u00f3bal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda]]; lastly, ten years of quiet diplomacy by Fathers Luis de Aliaga, Philip's confessor, and Juan de Santa Maria, Philip's daughter's confessor and a former client of [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Queen Margaret]],<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.97\"/> had begun to apply personal and religious pressure on the king to alter his method of government.<ref name=\"Williams, p.241\">Williams, p.241.</ref> Philip remained close to Lerma, however, and supported him in becoming a cardinal in March 1618 under [[Pope Paul V]], a position which would offer Lerma some protection as his government collapsed.\n\nLerma fell to an alliance of interests \u2013 Uceda, his son, led the attack, aiming to protect his future interests, allied with [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|Don Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], a well-connected noble with a background in diplomacy across Europe, whose nephew, [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]] was close to the heir to the throne, [[Philip IV of Spain|Prince Philip]]. Lerma departed for his ducal seat, and for six weeks Philip did nothing; then, in October, Philip signed a decree renouncing the powers of his former ''valido'', and announcing that he would rule in person.<ref name=\"Williams, p.241\"/> Uceda initially took over as the primary voice at court, but without his father's extensive powers, whilst De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga became Philip's minister for foreign and military affairs. Philip, whilst unwilling to move further against Lerma, took politically symbolic action against Lerma's former secretary [[Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n]], a figure emblematic of the former administration. Calder\u00f3n, suspected of having killed Philip's wife [[Margaret of Austria (1584-1611)|Queen Margaret]] by witchcraft in 1611, was ultimately tortured and then executed by Philip for the more plausible murder of the soldier Francisco de Juaras.<ref>Williams, p.242.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy==\n[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8792 philippus de III.tif|thumb|Philip III of Spain]]\n\nPhilip inherited an [[Spanish Empire|empire]] considerably enlarged by his father. On the peninsula itself, Philip II had successfully acquired [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] in 1580; across Europe, despite the ongoing [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch revolt]], Spanish possessions in Italy and along the [[Spanish Road]] appeared secure; globally, the combination of [[Spanish Empire|Castilian]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial territories]] gave a Spanish ruler unparalleled reach from the Americas to the Philippines and beyond through India to Africa.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.146.</ref> The challenge for such a ruler was that these territories were in legal reality separate bodies, different entities bound together through the 'supraterritorial' royal institutions of the Spanish crown, utilising Castilian nobility as a ruling caste.<ref>Zagorin, pp.3\u20134.</ref> Even within the peninsula itself, Philip would rule through the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the autonomous provinces of [[Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]] \u2013 all only loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip III.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.61.</ref> Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces.\n\n===Expulsion of the Moriscos===\n{{main|Expulsion of the Moriscos}}\nOne of Philip's first domestic changes was the issuing of a decree in 1609 for the expulsion of the [[Morisco]]s from Spain, timed to coincide with the declaration of a truce in the war for the Netherlands.<ref>Cruz, p.177.</ref> The Moriscos were the descendants of those Muslims that had converted to Christianity during the [[Reconquista]] of the previous centuries; despite their conversion, they retained a distinctive culture, including many Islamic practices.<ref name=\"Parker, 1984, p.150\">Parker, 1984, p.150.</ref> Philip II had made the elimination of the Morisco threat a key part of his domestic strategy in the south, attempting an assimilation campaign in the 1560s, which had resulted in the [[Morisco Revolt|revolt]] that concluded in 1570.<ref>Zagorin, p.15.</ref> In the final years of his rule, Philip's father had reinvigorated efforts to convert and assimilate the Moriscos, but with almost 200,000 in the south of Spain alone, it was clear by the early years of the new century that this policy was failing.<ref name=\"Parker, 1984, p.150\"/>\n\n[[File:La Expulsi\u00f3n en el Puerto de Denia. Vicente Mostre.jpg|thumb|left|[[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] at the port of [[D\u00e9nia]], by Vincente Mostre.]]\n\nThe idea of completely cleansing Spain of the Moriscos was proposed by [[Juan de Ribera]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Archbishop]] and [[Viceroy of Valencia]], whose views were influential with Philip III. Philip's eventual decree to expel a nationality that had lived in Spain for over 800 years and was assimilated within it was based less on doctrinal than financial considerations \u2013 confiscating the 'wealth' of the Moriscos - which caused jealousy and resentment by other Christians in Spain, especially in Valencia. Financially, the royal treasury stood to gain by seizing the assets of the removed peoples, whilst in due course those close to the crown would benefit from cheap land or gifts of estates.  Estimates vary slightly, but between around 275,000<ref name=\"Parker, 1984, p.150\"/> to over 300,000<ref name=\"Perry, p.133\">Perry, p.133.</ref> Moriscos were forced out of Spain between 1609 and 1614. To accomplish this, the ''armada'', or navy, and 30,000 soldiers were mobilized with the mission of transporting the families to [[Tunis]] or [[Morocco]]. Philip intervened in the problematic decision of what to do with Morisco children \u2013 should they be allowed to take them to Islamic countries, where they would be brought up as Muslims \u2013 and if they were to remain in Spain, what should be done with them? Philip paternalistically decreed that Morisco children under the age of seven could not be taken to Islamic countries, but that any children remaining in Valencia should be free from the threat of enslavement,<ref>Perry, p.148.</ref> and rejected some of Ribera's more extreme suggestions.<ref>Perry, p.157.</ref>\n\nWhilst popular at the time, and in keeping with earlier policies, this measure significantly damaged the economies of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Murcia]]. The supply of cheap labour and the number of rent paying property owners in these areas decreased considerably, as did agricultural outputs.<ref>De Maddalena, p.286.</ref> The cultivation of [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]] had to be substituted for [[white mulberry]], [[vineyard]]s, and [[wheat]].\n\n===Economic decline and failed reform===\n[[File:Retrato de Mateo Alem\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mateo Alem\u00e1n]], an early modern [[novelist]] who recorded the terrible 'plague that came down from Castile and the famine that rose from Andalusia' to cripple Philip III's domestic [[economy]].]]\n\nPhilip III's reign was marked by significant economic problems across Spain. [[Famine]] struck during the 1590s through a sequence of bad harvests, whilst from 1599 to 1600 and for several years afterwards there was a terrible outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] across Spain, killing over 10% of the population.<ref>Parker, 1985, p.235.</ref> [[Mateo Alem\u00e1n]], one of the first modern novelists in Europe, captured the despondent mood of the period, describing 'the plague that came down from Castile and the famine that rose from Andalusia' to grip the country.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.147.</ref> Whilst the failing harvests affected the rural areas most, the plagues reduced the urban population most significantly, in turn reducing the demand for manufactured goods and undermining the economy further.<ref>Parker, 1984, pp.146\u20137.</ref> The result was an economically weakened Spain with a rapidly falling population.\n\nFinancially, Philip's situation did not appear much better. He had inherited huge debts from his father, Philip II, and an unhelpful tradition that the [[kingdom of Castile]] bore the brunt of royal taxation \u2013 Castile carried 65% of total imperial costs by 1616.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\">Munck, p.51.</ref> Philip III received no money from the ''[[Cortes Generales|cortes]]'', or parliaments, of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], the Basque provinces or [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]; [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] only provided one contribution, in 1604.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> Philip did not openly challenge this situation, but instead depended more and more heavily on the Castilian ''cortes''; in turn, the ''cortes'' increasingly began to tie new grants of money to specific projects, subtly but steadily altering the relationship between the king and ''cortes''.<ref name=\"Thompson, p.189\">Thompson, p.189.</ref> By the financial crisis of 1607, the ''cortes'' had even insisted that it be recalled every three years, and that Philip take an oath \u2013 on pain of [[excommunication]] \u2013 to promise that he had spent the royal funds in line with the promises made previously to the ''cortes''.<ref name=\"Thompson, p.189\"/>\n\n[[File:Un demi croat \u00e0 l'effigie de Philippe III.jpg|thumb|left|Philip III of Spain]]\n\nPhilip and [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]]'s attempts to resolve this crisis largely failed, and were not helped by the increasing size of the royal household \u2013 an attempt to increase royal prestige and political authority<ref name=\"Feros, p.110\"/>  \u2013 Philip's own household costs rose enormously at a time of falling income.<ref>Kamen, 1991, p. 200.</ref> Philip's attempts to issue new currency \u2013 in particular the issues of the copper ''v\u00e9lon'' coinage in 1603\u201304, 1617 and 1621 \u2013 simply created considerable instability.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> The costs of the Dutch campaign resulted in Philip's [[bankruptcy]] in 1607, and the crown's attempt to resolve this by converting the ''[[Assiento|asiento]]'' tax system \u2013 high interest loans owed to tax farmers \u2013 into longer term ''juros'' bonds paying a much lower interest, produced a short-term benefit, but at the price of losing financial flexibility during future crises.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> By 1618, almost all Philip's incoming crown income was already assigned to its various creditors and he had almost no spending discretion left.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> Financially, the Spanish state had become dominated by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese bankers]] and lenders under Philip II, whose lines of credit had allowed the Spanish state to continue during its moments of financial crisis; under Philip III this process remained unchecked, building up considerable resentment against this foreign influence,<ref>Cruz, p.102.</ref> some going so far as to term the bankers 'white moors'.<ref>Cruz, p.103.</ref>\n\nThroughout Philip's reign, a body of analysis of Spain's condition began to emerge through the work of the numerous ''arbitristas'', or commentators, that dominated public discussions from around 1600 through to the 1630s.<ref>Parker, 1984, pp.147\u20138.</ref> These different voices focused heavily on the [[political economy]] of Spain \u2013 the rural depopulation, the diverse and bureaucratic administrative methods, the social hierarchies and corruption, offering numerous, if often contradictory, solutions.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.148.</ref> Nonetheless, through most of Philip's reign there was no significant attempt at reform \u2013 Philip continued to rule in line with local laws and customs. Philip encouraged consolidation of noble estates, selling off large quantities of crown lands to favoured nobles and creditors.<ref name=\"Munck, p.50\">Munck, p.50.</ref> There were no attempts to create an equivalent to the French ''[[intendant]]'' position \u2013 the closest equivalent, the ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]'', lacked the strong links to the crown required to overcome local opposition.<ref name=\"Munck, p.50\"/> Only in Philip's final years did reform begin to gain momentum; a reform committee, or ''Junta de Reformaci\u00f3n'', was established in Lerma's final months in 1618.<ref>Kamen, p.214.</ref> Under the incoming administration, including the reformist [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], this committee ground on, but would only deliver substantial, if ill-fated results, when rejuvenated under Philip IV's reign.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:The Somerset House Conference 19 August 1604.jpg|thumb|The [[Somerset House]] Conference between English and Spanish diplomats that brought an end to the [[Anglo\u2013Spanish War (1585)|Anglo\u2013Spanish War]] (1585\u20131604).]]\n\nOn his accession, Philip inherited two major conflicts from his father/granduncle. The first of these, the ongoing and long-running [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch revolt]], represented a serious challenge to Spanish power from the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in a crucial part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The second, the [[Anglo\u2013Spanish War (1585)|Anglo\u2013Spanish War]] was a newer, and less critical conflict with Protestant England, marked by a Spanish failure to successfully bring its huge military resources to bear on the smaller English military.\n\nPhilip's own foreign policy can be divided into three phases. For the first nine years of his reign, he pursued a highly aggressive set of policies, aiming to deliver a 'great victory'.<ref name=\"Williams, p.125\">Williams, p.125.</ref> His instructions to [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]] to wage a war of 'blood and iron' on his rebellious subjects in the Netherlands reflects this.<ref name=\"Williams, p.10\"/> After 1609, when it became evident that Spain was financially exhausted and Philip sought a truce with the Dutch, there followed a period of retrenchment; in the background, tensions continued to grow, however, and by 1618 the policies of Philip's 'proconsols' \u2013 men like [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Spinola]], [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Fuentes]], [[Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca|Villafranca]], [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Duke of Osuna|Osuna]] and [[Alfonso de la Cueva, marqu\u00e9s de Bedmar|Bedmar]] \u2013 were increasingly at odds with de Lerma's policy from Madrid.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p.127\"/> The final period, in which Philip intervened in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to secure the election of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] as Emperor and in which preparations were made for renewed conflict with the Dutch, largely occurred after the fall of de Lerma and the rise of a new, more aggressive set of advisors in the Madrid court.\n\n===War with the Dutch, England and the truce of 1609\u201321===\nPhilip's initial aim was to achieve a decisive 'great victory'<ref name=\"Williams, p.125\"/> in the [[Eighty Years' War|long running war]] against the rebellious Dutch provinces of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], whilst placing renewed pressure on the English government of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in an effort to terminate English support for their Dutch colleagues. The Spanish ''armada'', or navy, rebuilt in the 1590s, remained effective against the English,<ref>See Goodman (2002), for a thorough account of this revival.</ref> but after the failure of the Spanish invasion of Ireland, leading to the defeat at the [[Battle of Kinsale]], Philip reluctantly accepted that further attacks on England were unlikely to succeed.<ref name=\"Williams, p.125\"/> In the Netherlands, a new war strategy resulted in a re-establishment of Spanish power on the north side of the great rivers [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Rhine River|Rhine]], stepping up the military pressure on the rebel provinces. The strategy of a 'great victory,' however, began to descend into a financial war of attrition: the [[Southern Netherlands]] \u2013 still under Spanish control \u2013 and the [[Dutch Republic]] in the north \u2013 dominated by [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Protestants \u2013 were both exhausted, and after the 1607 financial crisis, Spain too was unable to pursue the war. Philip III turned to peace negotiations instead; with the accession to the throne of [[James I of England]] it became possible to terminate both the war and English support to the Dutch, with the signature in 1604 of the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]].<ref>Parker, 2004, p.212.</ref>\n\n[[File:Estatua de Felipe III de Espa\u00f1a - Plaza Mayor de Madrid.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Philip III in Madrid, by [[Giambologna]], finished by [[Pietro Tacca]] (1616).]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Years' Truce]] with the Dutch followed in 1609, which enabled the Southern Netherlands to recover, but it was a de facto recognition of the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], and many European powers established diplomatic relations with the Dutch. The truce did not stop the commercial and colonial expansion of the Dutch into the Caribbean and the East-Indies, although Spain had tried to impose the liquidation of the [[Dutch East India Company]] as a treaty condition. Minor concessions of the Dutch Republic were the scrapping of the plan to create a [[Dutch West India Company]] and to stop the harassment of the Portuguese in Asia. Both concessions were temporary as the Dutch soon recommenced preying upon Portuguese interests, which had already led to the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] in 1602 and would continue till 1654. At least with peace in Europe, the Twelve Year's truce gave Philip's regime an opportunity to begin to recover its financial position.\n\nWith the death of [[Henry IV of France]] \u2013 a supporter of the war against Spain \u2013 a period of instability commenced in the Kingdom of France. In a sequence of aggressive policy moves, and largely without firm direction from Philip, his regional [[proconsul]]s of the [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Duke of Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], viceroy of [[Naples]] and the [[Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca|Marquess of Villafranca]], the Governor of [[Milan]], directed the Spanish policy in Italy that encountered resistance from the Duchy of Savoy and the Republic of Venice. To secure the connection between Milan and the Netherlands a new route was opened through [[Valtellina#History|Valtellina]], then part of the independent state of the [[Three Leagues]] (the present day canton of [[Graub\u00fcnden]], Switzerland), and in 1618 the plot of Venice occurred in which the authorities engaged in the persecution of pro-Spanish agents.\n\n===Entry to the Thirty Years' War===\nIn the final years of Philip's reign, Spain entered the initial part of the conflict that would become known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348). The result was a decisive Spanish victory in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that would lead to a recommencement of the [[Eighty Years' War|war with the Dutch]] shortly after Philip's death. Europe was anticipating a fresh election for the position of Emperor upon the likely death of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]], who was heirless. Spain and Austria's common [[Habsburg]] ancestry influenced Spain's involvement in the convoluted politics of the Empire: on the one hand, Philip had a vested interest in the success of his cousin [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Bohemia]], who intended to follow Matthias to the throne; on the other, Philip had hopes of appointing one of his own family, such as [[Philip IV of Spain|Prince Philip]], to the Imperial throne<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.75\">Wedgwood, p.75.</ref> and worried that a failed bid by Ferdinand might reduce collective Habsburg prestige.<ref>Wedgwood, p.89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schlacht am Wei\u00dfen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of White Mountain]], 1620, a triumph for the later foreign policy of Philip III]]\n\nPhilip finally chose to intervene behind Ferdinand. Prince Philip had been rejected as unacceptable to the German nobility.<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.75\"/> Philip had also been increasingly influenced over the years by first [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Queen Margaret]], and later the other, powerful Habsburg women at court, whilst the incoming set of advisors that replaced de Lerma, especially de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, also saw Spain's future as part of a strong alliance with a Habsburg Holy Roman Empire.<ref>Ringrose, p.320.</ref> Finally, by the [[O\u00f1ate treaty]] of 29 July 1617, Ferdinand made a successful appeal to Philip's self-interest by promising Spain the Habsburg lands in [[Alsace]] in return for Spanish support for his election.<ref>Wedgwood, p.57.</ref>\n\nCrisis broke out in Ferdinand's kingdom of [[Bohemia]] during 1618\u201319, with a confrontation between Catholic and Protestant factions. Ferdinand asked Spain for help to put down the rebellion; the Protestant rebels turned to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the Palatinate as a new ruler and Emperor. The situation in the Empire was in many ways auspicious for Spanish strategy; in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] [[Ambrosio Spinola, marqu\u00e9s de los Balbases|Ambrosio Spinola]] had been conspiring to find an opportunity to intervene with the [[Army of Flanders]] into the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The Palatinate was a vital, Protestant set of territories along the Rhine guarding the most obvious route for reinforcements from other Spanish territories to arrive into the rebellious Dutch provinces (through Genoa).<ref name=\"Wedgwood, pp.113-4\"/> France, assumed bound to support Frederick against Ferdinand, was in fact inclined to remain neutral.<ref>Wedgwood, p.110-1.</ref> The Spanish troops headed by Spinola in the Palatinate and by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] in Bohemia achieved a decisive victory against the Czechs in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. With the Dutch now vulnerable to a strike through the Rhine valley, a renewed war against the Provinces, with the aim of forcing the Dutch to a more suitable permanent peace, appeared inevitable. Philip died in 1621 shortly before the recommencement of war \u2013 his son, Philip IV, retained his chief foreign policy advisor, [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], and an initially highly successful campaign against the Dutch began the same year.\n\n==Colonial policy==\n===Chile===\nIn the Americas Philip inherited a difficult situation in [[Colonial Chile|Chile]], where the [[Arauco War]] raged and the local [[Mapuche]] succeeded in [[Destruction of the Seven Cities|razing seven Spanish cities]] (1598\u20131604). An estimate by  [[Alonso Gonz\u00e1lez de N\u00e1jera]] put the toll at 3000 Spanish settlers killed and 500 Spanish women taken into captivity by Mapuche.<ref name=Luz2013>{{Cite journal|title=Las cautivas de las Sitece Ciudades: El cautiverio de mujeres hispanocriollas durante la Guerra de Arauco, en la perspectiva de cuatro cronistas (s.

The story told in the memoirs of the French ambassador [[Bassompierre]], that he was killed by the heat of a ''brasero'' (a pan of hot charcoal), because the proper official to take it away was not at hand, is a humorous exaggeration of the formal etiquette of the court.\n\nPhilip has generally left a poor legacy with historians.  Three major historians of the period have described an 'undistinguished and insignificant man',<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.55\"/> a 'miserable monarch',<ref>Stradling, p.18.</ref> whose 'only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice'.<ref>Elliott, 1963, pp. 300\u2013301.</ref>  More generally, Philip has largely retained the reputation of 'a weak, dim-witted monarch who preferred hunting and traveling to governing'.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.92\">S\u00e1nchez, p.92.</ref>  Unlike Philip IV, whose reputation has improved significantly in the light of recent analysis, Philip III's reign has been relatively unstudied, possibly because of the negative interpretation given to the role of Philip and Lerma during the period.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.92\"/>  Traditionally, the decline of Spain has been placed from the 1590s onwards; revisionist historians from the 1960s, however, presented an alternative analysis, arguing that in many ways Philip III's Spain of 1621 \u2013 reinforced with new territories in Alsace, at peace with France, dominant in the Holy Roman Empire, and about to begin a successful campaign against the Dutch \u2013 was in a much stronger position than in 1598, despite the poor personal performance of her king during the period.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.145.</ref>  Philip's use of Lerma as his ''valido'' has formed one of the key historical and contemporary criticisms against him; recent work<ref>In particular, Feros (2006) and Williams' (2006) recent extensive studies of the period, and S\u00e1nchez's (1996) analysis of the role of powerful women, often under-reported in historical documents, at Philip's court.</ref> has perhaps begun to present a more nuanced picture of the relationship and the institution that survived for the next forty years in Spanish royal government.\n\n==Titles and styles==\n[[File:Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_Spain_(1580-1668).svg|thumb|120px|Coat of arms of Philip III]]\n\nIn the 1604 [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], Philip was styled ''\"Philip the Third, by the grace of God, king of [[list of Castilian kings|Castile]], [[list of Leonese kings|Leon]], [[list of Aragonese kings|Aragon]] and the [[list of Sicilian kings|Two Sicilies]], [[list of kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[list of Portuguese kings|Portugal]], [[list of Navarrese kings|Navarre]], [[list of kings of Granada|Granada]], [[list of kings of Toledo|Toledo]], [[list of Valencian kings|Valencia]], [[list of Galician kings|Galicia]], the [[list of kings of Majorca|Majorcas]], [[list of kings of Seville|Seville]], [[list of kings of Cordoba|Cordoba]], [[list of Sardinian kings|Corsica]], [[list of Murcian kings|Murcia]], [[list of kings of Guinea|Guinea]], [[list of kings of the Algarve|Algarve]], [[list of kings of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], the [[list of kings of the Canary Islands|Canary Islands]], also of the Eastern and Western Indies, and the islands and ''[[Land mass|terra firma]]'' of the Ocean Sea, [[archduke of Austria]], duke of [[list of dukes of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[list of dukes of Milan|Milan]], count of [[list of counts of Habsburg|Habsburg]], [[list of counts of Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[list of counts of Biscay|Biscay]], and lord of [[list of lords of Molina|Molina]], etc.\"'' in full and \"Philip III, King of the Spains\" for short.<ref>Davenport, page number missing.</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\nLike many [[Habsburg]]s, Philip III was the product of extensive [[Human inbreeding|inbreeding]]. His father, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], a product of [[cousin marriage|marriage between first cousins]], married his niece, [[Anna of Austria (1549\u20131580)|Anna of Austria]], herself the product of a cousin couple.

He was also, as '''Philip II''', [[King of Portugal]], [[King of Naples|Naples]], [[King of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[King of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Duke of Milan]] from 1598 until his death in 1621.\n\nA member of the [[House of Habsburg]], Philip III was born in [[Madrid]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]] and his fourth wife and niece [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)|Anna]], the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and [[Maria of Spain]]. Philip III later married his cousin [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]], sister of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nAlthough also known in Spain as '''Philip the Pious''',<ref>Stradling, p. 9.</ref> Philip's political reputation abroad has been largely negative \u2013 an 'undistinguished and insignificant man,' a 'miserable monarch,' whose 'only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice,' to quote historians C. V. Wedgwood, R. Stradling and J. H. Elliott.<ref>Wedgwood, p. 55; Stradling, p. 18; Elliott, 1963, pp. 300\u2013301.</ref> In particular, Philip's reliance on his corrupt chief minister, the [[Francisco Gom\u00e9z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]], drew much criticism at the time and afterwards. For many, the decline of Spain can be dated to the economic difficulties that set in during the early years of his reign. Nonetheless, as the ruler of the [[Spanish Empire]] at its height and as the king who achieved a [[Twelve Years' Truce|temporary peace]] with the Dutch (1609\u20131621) and brought Spain into the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) through an (initially) extremely successful campaign, Philip's reign remains a critical period in Spanish history.\n\n==Early life==\nAfter Philip III's older brother [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Carlos]] died insane, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] had concluded that one of the causes of Carlos' condition had been the influence of the warring factions at the Spanish court.<ref name=\"Feros, p.16\">Feros, p.16.</ref> He believed that Carlos' education and upbringing had been badly affected by this, resulting in his lunacy and disobedience, and accordingly he set out to pay much greater attention to arrangements for his later sons.<ref name=\"Feros, p.16\"/> Philip II appointed Juan de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, then [[Diego, Prince of Asturias|Prince Diego]]'s governor, to continue this role for Philip, and chose Garc\u00eda de Loaysa as his tutor.<ref name=\"Feros, p.16\"/> They were joined by Crist\u00f3bal de Moura, a close supporter of Philip II. In combination, Philip believed, they would provide a consistent, stable upbringing for Prince Philip, and ensure he avoided the same fate as Carlos.<ref name=\"Feros, p.17\">Feros, p.17.</ref> Philip's education was to follow the model for royal princes laid down by Father [[Juan de Mariana]], focusing on the imposition of restraints and encouragement to form the personality of the individual at an early age, aiming to deliver a king who was neither tyrannical nor excessively under the influence of his courtiers.<ref name=\"Feros, p.17\"/>\n[[File:3157 Print 14632kopie.jpg|thumb|Philip III of Spain, 1599-1601, The Phoebus Foundation]]\nPrince Philip appears to have been generally liked by his contemporaries: 'dynamic, good-natured and earnest,' suitably pious, having a 'lively body and a peaceful disposition,' albeit with a relatively weak constitution.<ref name=\"Feros, p.19\">Feros, p.19.</ref> The comparison with the memory of the disobedient and ultimately insane Carlos was usually a positive one, although some commented that Prince Philip appeared less intelligent and politically competent than his late brother.<ref name=\"Feros, p.19\"/> Indeed, although Philip was educated in [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[astronomy]], and appears to have been a competent linguist,<ref name=\"Feros, p.17\"/> recent historians suspect that much of his tutors' focus on Philip's undeniably pleasant, pious and respectful disposition was to avoid reporting that, languages aside, he was not in fact particularly intelligent or academically gifted.<ref name=\"Williams, p.38\">Williams, p.38.</ref> Nonetheless, Philip does not appear to have been naive \u2013 his correspondence to his daughters shows a distinctive cautious streak in his advice on dealing with court intrigue.<ref>S\u00e1nchez, p.101.</ref>\n\nPhilip first met the [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Marquis of Denia]] \u2013 the future Duke of Lerma \u2013 then, a gentleman of the King's chamber, in his early teens.<ref name=\"Williams, p.38\"/> Lerma and Philip became close friends, but Lerma was considered unsuitable by the King and Philip's tutors. Lerma was dispatched to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] as a [[Viceroy]] in 1595, with the aim of removing Philip from his influence;<ref name=\"Williams, p.38\"/> but after Lerma pleaded poor health, he was allowed to return two years later. By now in poor health himself, King Philip II was becoming increasingly concerned over the prince's future, and he attempted to establish de Moura as a future, trusted advisor to his son, reinforcing de Loaysa's position by appointing him [[archbishop]].<ref name=\"Williams, p.39\">Williams, p.39.</ref> The prince received a new, conservative [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] confessor.<ref name=\"Williams, p.39\"/> The following year, Philip II died after a painful illness, leaving the [[Spanish Empire]] to his son (and grandnephew), King Philip III.\n\n==Religion, Philip and the role of women at court==\nPhilip married his cousin, [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Margaret of Austria]], on 18 April 1599, a year after becoming king. Margaret, the sister of the future [[Emperor Ferdinand II]], would be one of three women at Philip's court who would apply considerable influence over the king.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.91\">S\u00e1nchez, p.91.</ref> Margaret was considered by contemporaries to be extremely pious \u2013 in some cases, excessively pious, and too influenced by the Church<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.98\">S\u00e1nchez, p.98.</ref> \u2013 'astute and very skillful' in her political dealings,<ref>S\u00e1nchez, p.99.</ref> although 'melancholic' and unhappy over the influence of the Duke of Lerma over her husband at court.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.98\"/> Margaret continued to fight an ongoing battle with Lerma for influence up until her death in 1611. Philip had an 'affectionate, close relationship' with Margaret,<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.100\">S\u00e1nchez, p.100.</ref> and paid her additional attention after she bore him a son in 1605.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.100\"/>\n\nMargaret, alongside Philip's grandmother/aunt, [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Empress Maria]] \u2013 the Austrian representative to the Spanish court \u2013 and [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria (1567\u20131633)|Margaret of the Cross]], Maria's daughter \u2013 formed a powerful, uncompromising [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and pro-Austrian voice within Philip's life.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.91\"/> They were successful, for example, in convincing Philip to provide financial support to Ferdinand from 1600 onwards.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.100\"/> Philip steadily acquired other religious advisors. Father Juan de Santa Maria \u2013 confessor to Philip's daughter, [[Don (honorific)|do\u00f1a]] [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria]], was felt by contemporaries to have an excessive influence over Philip at the end of his life,<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.97\">S\u00e1nchez, p.97.</ref> and both he and Luis de Aliaga, Philip's own [[confessor]], were credited with influencing the overthrow of Lerma in 1618. Similarly Mariana de San Jose, a favoured nun of Queen Margaret's, was also criticised for her later influence over the King's actions.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.97\"/>\n\n==Style of government==\n[[File:Felipe3-Spain.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip III of Spain]]\n\nThe Spanish crown at the time ruled through a system of royal councils. The most significant of these were the Councils of State and its subordinate Council for War, that were in turn supported by the seven professional councils for the different regions, and four specialised councils for the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the [[Military order (society)|Military Orders]], Finance and the [[Papal income tax|Crusade tax]].<ref>Williams, p.35.</ref> These councils were then supplemented by small committees, or ''juntas'', as necessary, such as the 'junta of the night' through which Philip II exercised personal authority towards the end of his reign.<ref name=\"Williams, p.34\">Williams, p.34.</ref> As a matter of policy, Philip had tried to avoid appointing grandees to major positions of power within his government and relied heavily on the lesser nobles, the so-called 'service' nobility.<ref name=\"Williams, p.34\"/> Philip II had taken the traditional system of councils and applied a high degree of personal scrutiny to them, especially in matters of paperwork, which he declined to delegate \u2013 the result was a 'ponderous' process.<ref>Munck, p.49.</ref> To his contemporaries, the degree of personal oversight he exercised was excessive; his 'self-imposed role as the chief clerk to the Spanish empire'<ref>Mattingly, p.74.</ref> was not thought entirely appropriate. Philip first started to become engaged in practical government at the age of 15, when he joined Philip II's private committee.<ref name=\"Feros, p.19\"/>\n\nPhilip III's approach to government appears to have stemmed from three main drivers. Firstly, he was heavily influenced by the [[Irenicism|eirenic]] ideas being circulated in Italian circles in reaction to the new [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] theories of governance, typified by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]].<ref>Tuck, p.121.</ref> Writers such as Girolamo Frachetta, who became a particular favourite of Philip, had propagated a conservative definition of 'reason of state' which centred on exercising a princely prudence and a strict obedience to the laws and customs of the country that one ruled.<ref>Tuck, p.122.</ref> Secondly, Philip may have shared Lerma's view that the governmental system of Philip II was fast proving impractical and unnecessarily excluded the great nobles of the kingdoms \u2013 it had been creaking badly in the last decades of his father's life.<ref>Williams, pp.47\u20138.</ref> Lastly, Philip's own personality and his friendship with Lerma heavily shaped his approach to policy-making. The result was a radical shift in the role of the crown in government from the model of Philip II.\n\n===Duke of Lerma as ''valido''===\n[[File:Retrato ecuestre del duque de Lerma (Rubens).jpg|thumb|left|''Francisco Gom\u00e9z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma,'' [[Spain|Spanish]] statesman]]\n\nWithin a few hours of Philip ascending to the throne, [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]] had been made a royal counsellor by the new king and set about establishing himself as a fully fledged ''[[Favourite|valido]]'', or royal favourite.<ref>Williams, p.42.</ref> Lerma, in due course declared a duke, positioned himself as the gateway to the king. All the business of government, Philip instructed, was to arrive in writing and be channeled through Lerma before reaching him.<ref>Feros, p.112.</ref> Whilst Philip was not hugely active in government in other ways, once these memoranda, or ''consulta'', had reached him he appears to have been assiduous in commenting on them.<ref name=\"Williams, p.104\">Williams, p.104.</ref> Debates in royal councils would now only begin upon the written instruction of the king \u2013 again, through Lerma.<ref name=\"Feros, p.113\">Feros, p.113.</ref> All members of royal councils were under orders to maintain complete transparency with Lerma as the king's personal representative;<ref name=\"Feros, p.113\"/> indeed, in 1612 the councils were ordered by Philip to obey Lerma as if he were the king.<ref name=\"Williams, p.104\"/> The degree to which Lerma himself played an active role in government has been disputed.

The novel idea of a ''[[Favourite|valido]]'' exercising power went against the long-standing popular conception that the king should exercise his powers personally, not through another.<ref>Feros, pp.117\u20138.</ref> Before long, the apparatus of the Spanish government was packed with Lerma's relatives, Lerma's servants and Lerma's political friends, to the exclusion of others.<ref>Feros, p.133.</ref> Lerma responded by further limiting his public visibility in politics, avoiding signing and writing documents personally,<ref name=\"Williams, p.10\">Williams, p.10.</ref> and constantly stressing that he was, humbly, only working on behalf of his master, Philip III.\n\n===Imperial proconsuls===\n[[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|De Lerma]]'s role as royal favourite at court was further complicated by the rise of various '[[proconsul]]s' under Philip III's reign \u2013 significant Spanish representatives overseas, who came to exercise independent judgement and even independent policies in the absence of strong leadership from the centre.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p.127\">Polisensky, p.127.</ref> The challenges to government communication during the period encouraged aspects of this, but the phenomenon was much more marked under Philip III than under either the reign of his father or son.\n\n[[File:Studio of Peter Paul Rubens - Marquis Ambrogio Spinola.jpg|thumb|[[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrosio Spinola]], one of Philip III's various imperial [[proconsul]]s, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]\n\nIn the Netherlands, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] had bequeathed his remaining territories in the Low Countries to his daughter [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella of Spain]] and her husband, [[Archduke Albert of Austria (1559-1621)|Archduke Albert]], under the condition that if she died without heirs, the province would return to the Spanish Crown. Given that Isabella was notoriously childless, it was clear that this was only intended to be a temporary measure, and that Philip II had envisaged an early revision to Philip III.<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.55\">Wedgwood, p.55.</ref> As a result, Philip's foreign policy in the Netherlands would be exercised through the strong-willed Archdukes, but in the knowledge that ultimately the [[Spanish Netherlands]] would return to him as king.<ref>In reality, the Archdukes outlived Philip, resulting in the reunification occurring under his son, Philip IV.</ref> Meanwhile, the Italian-born [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrosio Spinola]] was to perform a crucial role as a Spanish general in the [[Army of Flanders]]. Having demonstrated his military prowess at the [[siege of Ostend]] in 1603, Spinola rapidly started to propose and implement policies almost independently of the central councils in Madrid,<ref>Williams, p.127.</ref> somehow managing to achieve military victories even without central funding from Spain.<ref>Williams, p.128.</ref> De Lerma was uncertain of how to deal with Spinola; on the one hand, de Lerma desperately needed a successful military commander in the Netherlands \u2013 on the other, de Lerma was contemptuous of Spinola's relatively low origins and scared of his potential to destabilise de Lerma at court.<ref>Williams, pp.126\u20137.</ref> In the years leading to the outbreak of war in 1618, Spinola was working to produce a plan to finally defeat the Dutch, involving an intervention in the Rhineland followed by fresh hostilities aiming to cut the Low Countries in two: portrayed at the time as the 'spider in the web' of Catholic politics in the region, Spinola was operating without significant consultation with Philip in Madrid.<ref name=\"Wedgwood, pp.113-4\">Wedgwood, pp.113\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn Italy, a parallel situation emerged. The [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Count of Fuentes]], as governor of [[Lombardy]], exploited the lack of guidance from Madrid to pursue his own highly interventionist policy across north Italy, including making independent offers to support the Papacy by invading the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] in 1607.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.153-4.</ref> Fuentes remained in power and pursuing his own policies until his death. The [[Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca|Marquis of Villafranca]], as governor of [[Milan]], similarly exercised his own considerable judgement on foreign policy. The [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Duke of Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], who had married into the Sandovel family as a close ally of Lerma, again showed significant independence as the Viceroy of Naples towards the end of Philip's reign. In conjunction with the Spanish ambassador to Venice, the influential [[Alfonso de la Cueva, marqu\u00e9s de Bedmar|Marquis of Bedmar]], Osuna pursued a policy of raising an extensive army, intercepting Venetian shipping and imposing sufficiently high taxes that threats of a revolt began to emerge. To exacerbate matters, Osuna was found to have prevented the local Neapolitans from petitioning Philip III to complain.<ref name=\"Williams, p.245\">Williams, p.245.</ref> Osuna fell from power only when de Lerma had lost his royal favour, and Osuna's negative impact on Philip's plans for intervention in Germany had become intolerable.<ref name=\"Williams, p.245\"/>\n\n===Fall of Lerma===\n[[File:Rodrigo calderon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n]], executed by Philip III to satisfy the [[Duke of Lerma]]'s enemies, painted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]\n\nFrom 1612 onwards, and certainly by 1617, the [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]] administration was crumbling. The monopoly of power in the hands of the Lerma's Sandoval family had generated numerous enemies; Lerma's personal enrichment in office had become a scandal; Lerma's extravagant spending and personal debts was beginning to alarm his own son, [[Crist\u00f3bal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda]]; lastly, ten years of quiet diplomacy by Fathers Luis de Aliaga, Philip's confessor, and Juan de Santa Maria, Philip's daughter's confessor and a former client of [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Queen Margaret]],<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.97\"/> had begun to apply personal and religious pressure on the king to alter his method of government.<ref name=\"Williams, p.241\">Williams, p.241.</ref> Philip remained close to Lerma, however, and supported him in becoming a cardinal in March 1618 under [[Pope Paul V]], a position which would offer Lerma some protection as his government collapsed.\n\nLerma fell to an alliance of interests \u2013 Uceda, his son, led the attack, aiming to protect his future interests, allied with [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|Don Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], a well-connected noble with a background in diplomacy across Europe, whose nephew, [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]] was close to the heir to the throne, [[Philip IV of Spain|Prince Philip]]. Lerma departed for his ducal seat, and for six weeks Philip did nothing; then, in October, Philip signed a decree renouncing the powers of his former ''valido'', and announcing that he would rule in person.<ref name=\"Williams, p.241\"/> Uceda initially took over as the primary voice at court, but without his father's extensive powers, whilst De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga became Philip's minister for foreign and military affairs. Philip, whilst unwilling to move further against Lerma, took politically symbolic action against Lerma's former secretary [[Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n]], a figure emblematic of the former administration. Calder\u00f3n, suspected of having killed Philip's wife [[Margaret of Austria (1584-1611)|Queen Margaret]] by witchcraft in 1611, was ultimately tortured and then executed by Philip for the more plausible murder of the soldier Francisco de Juaras.<ref>Williams, p.242.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy==\n[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8792 philippus de III.tif|thumb|Philip III of Spain]]\n\nPhilip inherited an [[Spanish Empire|empire]] considerably enlarged by his father. On the peninsula itself, Philip II had successfully acquired [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] in 1580; across Europe, despite the ongoing [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch revolt]], Spanish possessions in Italy and along the [[Spanish Road]] appeared secure; globally, the combination of [[Spanish Empire|Castilian]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial territories]] gave a Spanish ruler unparalleled reach from the Americas to the Philippines and beyond through India to Africa.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.146.</ref> The challenge for such a ruler was that these territories were in legal reality separate bodies, different entities bound together through the 'supraterritorial' royal institutions of the Spanish crown, utilising Castilian nobility as a ruling caste.<ref>Zagorin, pp.3\u20134.</ref> Even within the peninsula itself, Philip would rule through the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the autonomous provinces of [[Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]] \u2013 all only loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip III.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.61.</ref> Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces.\n\n===Expulsion of the Moriscos===\n{{main|Expulsion of the Moriscos}}\nOne of Philip's first domestic changes was the issuing of a decree in 1609 for the expulsion of the [[Morisco]]s from Spain, timed to coincide with the declaration of a truce in the war for the Netherlands.<ref>Cruz, p.177.</ref> The Moriscos were the descendants of those Muslims that had converted to Christianity during the [[Reconquista]] of the previous centuries; despite their conversion, they retained a distinctive culture, including many Islamic practices.<ref name=\"Parker, 1984, p.150\">Parker, 1984, p.150.</ref> Philip II had made the elimination of the Morisco threat a key part of his domestic strategy in the south, attempting an assimilation campaign in the 1560s, which had resulted in the [[Morisco Revolt|revolt]] that concluded in 1570.<ref>Zagorin, p.15.</ref> In the final years of his rule, Philip's father had reinvigorated efforts to convert and assimilate the Moriscos, but with almost 200,000 in the south of Spain alone, it was clear by the early years of the new century that this policy was failing.<ref name=\"Parker, 1984, p.150\"/>\n\n[[File:La Expulsi\u00f3n en el Puerto de Denia. Vicente Mostre.jpg|thumb|left|[[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] at the port of [[D\u00e9nia]], by Vincente Mostre.]]\n\nThe idea of completely cleansing Spain of the Moriscos was proposed by [[Juan de Ribera]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Archbishop]] and [[Viceroy of Valencia]], whose views were influential with Philip III. Philip's eventual decree to expel a nationality that had lived in Spain for over 800 years and was assimilated within it was based less on doctrinal than financial considerations \u2013 confiscating the 'wealth' of the Moriscos - which caused jealousy and resentment by other Christians in Spain, especially in Valencia. Financially, the royal treasury stood to gain by seizing the assets of the removed peoples, whilst in due course those close to the crown would benefit from cheap land or gifts of estates.  Estimates vary slightly, but between around 275,000<ref name=\"Parker, 1984, p.150\"/> to over 300,000<ref name=\"Perry, p.133\">Perry, p.133.</ref> Moriscos were forced out of Spain between 1609 and 1614. To accomplish this, the ''armada'', or navy, and 30,000 soldiers were mobilized with the mission of transporting the families to [[Tunis]] or [[Morocco]]. Philip intervened in the problematic decision of what to do with Morisco children \u2013 should they be allowed to take them to Islamic countries, where they would be brought up as Muslims \u2013 and if they were to remain in Spain, what should be done with them? Philip paternalistically decreed that Morisco children under the age of seven could not be taken to Islamic countries, but that any children remaining in Valencia should be free from the threat of enslavement,<ref>Perry, p.148.</ref> and rejected some of Ribera's more extreme suggestions.<ref>Perry, p.157.</ref>\n\nWhilst popular at the time, and in keeping with earlier policies, this measure significantly damaged the economies of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Murcia]]. The supply of cheap labour and the number of rent paying property owners in these areas decreased considerably, as did agricultural outputs.<ref>De Maddalena, p.286.</ref> The cultivation of [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]] had to be substituted for [[white mulberry]], [[vineyard]]s, and [[wheat]].\n\n===Economic decline and failed reform===\n[[File:Retrato de Mateo Alem\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mateo Alem\u00e1n]], an early modern [[novelist]] who recorded the terrible 'plague that came down from Castile and the famine that rose from Andalusia' to cripple Philip III's domestic [[economy]].]]\n\nPhilip III's reign was marked by significant economic problems across Spain. [[Famine]] struck during the 1590s through a sequence of bad harvests, whilst from 1599 to 1600 and for several years afterwards there was a terrible outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] across Spain, killing over 10% of the population.<ref>Parker, 1985, p.235.</ref> [[Mateo Alem\u00e1n]], one of the first modern novelists in Europe, captured the despondent mood of the period, describing 'the plague that came down from Castile and the famine that rose from Andalusia' to grip the country.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.147.</ref> Whilst the failing harvests affected the rural areas most, the plagues reduced the urban population most significantly, in turn reducing the demand for manufactured goods and undermining the economy further.<ref>Parker, 1984, pp.146\u20137.</ref> The result was an economically weakened Spain with a rapidly falling population.\n\nFinancially, Philip's situation did not appear much better. He had inherited huge debts from his father, Philip II, and an unhelpful tradition that the [[kingdom of Castile]] bore the brunt of royal taxation \u2013 Castile carried 65% of total imperial costs by 1616.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\">Munck, p.51.</ref> Philip III received no money from the ''[[Cortes Generales|cortes]]'', or parliaments, of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], the Basque provinces or [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]; [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] only provided one contribution, in 1604.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> Philip did not openly challenge this situation, but instead depended more and more heavily on the Castilian ''cortes''; in turn, the ''cortes'' increasingly began to tie new grants of money to specific projects, subtly but steadily altering the relationship between the king and ''cortes''.<ref name=\"Thompson, p.189\">Thompson, p.189.</ref> By the financial crisis of 1607, the ''cortes'' had even insisted that it be recalled every three years, and that Philip take an oath \u2013 on pain of [[excommunication]] \u2013 to promise that he had spent the royal funds in line with the promises made previously to the ''cortes''.<ref name=\"Thompson, p.189\"/>\n\n[[File:Un demi croat \u00e0 l'effigie de Philippe III.jpg|thumb|left|Philip III of Spain]]\n\nPhilip and [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]]'s attempts to resolve this crisis largely failed, and were not helped by the increasing size of the royal household \u2013 an attempt to increase royal prestige and political authority<ref name=\"Feros, p.110\"/>  \u2013 Philip's own household costs rose enormously at a time of falling income.<ref>Kamen, 1991, p. 200.</ref> Philip's attempts to issue new currency \u2013 in particular the issues of the copper ''v\u00e9lon'' coinage in 1603\u201304, 1617 and 1621 \u2013 simply created considerable instability.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> The costs of the Dutch campaign resulted in Philip's [[bankruptcy]] in 1607, and the crown's attempt to resolve this by converting the ''[[Assiento|asiento]]'' tax system \u2013 high interest loans owed to tax farmers \u2013 into longer term ''juros'' bonds paying a much lower interest, produced a short-term benefit, but at the price of losing financial flexibility during future crises.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> By 1618, almost all Philip's incoming crown income was already assigned to its various creditors and he had almost no spending discretion left.<ref name=\"Munck, p.51\"/> Financially, the Spanish state had become dominated by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese bankers]] and lenders under Philip II, whose lines of credit had allowed the Spanish state to continue during its moments of financial crisis; under Philip III this process remained unchecked, building up considerable resentment against this foreign influence,<ref>Cruz, p.102.</ref> some going so far as to term the bankers 'white moors'.<ref>Cruz, p.103.</ref>\n\nThroughout Philip's reign, a body of analysis of Spain's condition began to emerge through the work of the numerous ''arbitristas'', or commentators, that dominated public discussions from around 1600 through to the 1630s.<ref>Parker, 1984, pp.147\u20138.</ref> These different voices focused heavily on the [[political economy]] of Spain \u2013 the rural depopulation, the diverse and bureaucratic administrative methods, the social hierarchies and corruption, offering numerous, if often contradictory, solutions.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.148.</ref> Nonetheless, through most of Philip's reign there was no significant attempt at reform \u2013 Philip continued to rule in line with local laws and customs. Philip encouraged consolidation of noble estates, selling off large quantities of crown lands to favoured nobles and creditors.<ref name=\"Munck, p.50\">Munck, p.50.</ref> There were no attempts to create an equivalent to the French ''[[intendant]]'' position \u2013 the closest equivalent, the ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]'', lacked the strong links to the crown required to overcome local opposition.<ref name=\"Munck, p.50\"/> Only in Philip's final years did reform begin to gain momentum; a reform committee, or ''Junta de Reformaci\u00f3n'', was established in Lerma's final months in 1618.<ref>Kamen, p.214.</ref> Under the incoming administration, including the reformist [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], this committee ground on, but would only deliver substantial, if ill-fated results, when rejuvenated under Philip IV's reign.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:The Somerset House Conference 19 August 1604.jpg|thumb|The [[Somerset House]] Conference between English and Spanish diplomats that brought an end to the [[Anglo\u2013Spanish War (1585)|Anglo\u2013Spanish War]] (1585\u20131604).]]\n\nOn his accession, Philip inherited two major conflicts from his father/granduncle. The first of these, the ongoing and long-running [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch revolt]], represented a serious challenge to Spanish power from the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in a crucial part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The second, the [[Anglo\u2013Spanish War (1585)|Anglo\u2013Spanish War]] was a newer, and less critical conflict with Protestant England, marked by a Spanish failure to successfully bring its huge military resources to bear on the smaller English military.\n\nPhilip's own foreign policy can be divided into three phases. For the first nine years of his reign, he pursued a highly aggressive set of policies, aiming to deliver a 'great victory'.<ref name=\"Williams, p.125\">Williams, p.125.</ref> His instructions to [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Lerma]] to wage a war of 'blood and iron' on his rebellious subjects in the Netherlands reflects this.<ref name=\"Williams, p.10\"/> After 1609, when it became evident that Spain was financially exhausted and Philip sought a truce with the Dutch, there followed a period of retrenchment; in the background, tensions continued to grow, however, and by 1618 the policies of Philip's 'proconsols' \u2013 men like [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Spinola]], [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Fuentes]], [[Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca|Villafranca]], [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Duke of Osuna|Osuna]] and [[Alfonso de la Cueva, marqu\u00e9s de Bedmar|Bedmar]] \u2013 were increasingly at odds with de Lerma's policy from Madrid.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p.127\"/> The final period, in which Philip intervened in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to secure the election of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] as Emperor and in which preparations were made for renewed conflict with the Dutch, largely occurred after the fall of de Lerma and the rise of a new, more aggressive set of advisors in the Madrid court.\n\n===War with the Dutch, England and the truce of 1609\u201321===\nPhilip's initial aim was to achieve a decisive 'great victory'<ref name=\"Williams, p.125\"/> in the [[Eighty Years' War|long running war]] against the rebellious Dutch provinces of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], whilst placing renewed pressure on the English government of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in an effort to terminate English support for their Dutch colleagues. The Spanish ''armada'', or navy, rebuilt in the 1590s, remained effective against the English,<ref>See Goodman (2002), for a thorough account of this revival.</ref> but after the failure of the Spanish invasion of Ireland, leading to the defeat at the [[Battle of Kinsale]], Philip reluctantly accepted that further attacks on England were unlikely to succeed.<ref name=\"Williams, p.125\"/> In the Netherlands, a new war strategy resulted in a re-establishment of Spanish power on the north side of the great rivers [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Rhine River|Rhine]], stepping up the military pressure on the rebel provinces. The strategy of a 'great victory,' however, began to descend into a financial war of attrition: the [[Southern Netherlands]] \u2013 still under Spanish control \u2013 and the [[Dutch Republic]] in the north \u2013 dominated by [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Protestants \u2013 were both exhausted, and after the 1607 financial crisis, Spain too was unable to pursue the war. Philip III turned to peace negotiations instead; with the accession to the throne of [[James I of England]] it became possible to terminate both the war and English support to the Dutch, with the signature in 1604 of the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]].<ref>Parker, 2004, p.212.</ref>\n\n[[File:Estatua de Felipe III de Espa\u00f1a - Plaza Mayor de Madrid.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Philip III in Madrid, by [[Giambologna]], finished by [[Pietro Tacca]] (1616).]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Years' Truce]] with the Dutch followed in 1609, which enabled the Southern Netherlands to recover, but it was a de facto recognition of the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], and many European powers established diplomatic relations with the Dutch. The truce did not stop the commercial and colonial expansion of the Dutch into the Caribbean and the East-Indies, although Spain had tried to impose the liquidation of the [[Dutch East India Company]] as a treaty condition. Minor concessions of the Dutch Republic were the scrapping of the plan to create a [[Dutch West India Company]] and to stop the harassment of the Portuguese in Asia. Both concessions were temporary as the Dutch soon recommenced preying upon Portuguese interests, which had already led to the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] in 1602 and would continue till 1654. At least with peace in Europe, the Twelve Year's truce gave Philip's regime an opportunity to begin to recover its financial position.\n\nWith the death of [[Henry IV of France]] \u2013 a supporter of the war against Spain \u2013 a period of instability commenced in the Kingdom of France. In a sequence of aggressive policy moves, and largely without firm direction from Philip, his regional [[proconsul]]s of the [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Duke of Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], viceroy of [[Naples]] and the [[Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca|Marquess of Villafranca]], the Governor of [[Milan]], directed the Spanish policy in Italy that encountered resistance from the Duchy of Savoy and the Republic of Venice. To secure the connection between Milan and the Netherlands a new route was opened through [[Valtellina#History|Valtellina]], then part of the independent state of the [[Three Leagues]] (the present day canton of [[Graub\u00fcnden]], Switzerland), and in 1618 the plot of Venice occurred in which the authorities engaged in the persecution of pro-Spanish agents.\n\n===Entry to the Thirty Years' War===\nIn the final years of Philip's reign, Spain entered the initial part of the conflict that would become known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348). The result was a decisive Spanish victory in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that would lead to a recommencement of the [[Eighty Years' War|war with the Dutch]] shortly after Philip's death. Europe was anticipating a fresh election for the position of Emperor upon the likely death of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]], who was heirless. Spain and Austria's common [[Habsburg]] ancestry influenced Spain's involvement in the convoluted politics of the Empire: on the one hand, Philip had a vested interest in the success of his cousin [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Bohemia]], who intended to follow Matthias to the throne; on the other, Philip had hopes of appointing one of his own family, such as [[Philip IV of Spain|Prince Philip]], to the Imperial throne<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.75\">Wedgwood, p.75.</ref> and worried that a failed bid by Ferdinand might reduce collective Habsburg prestige.<ref>Wedgwood, p.89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schlacht am Wei\u00dfen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of White Mountain]], 1620, a triumph for the later foreign policy of Philip III]]\n\nPhilip finally chose to intervene behind Ferdinand. Prince Philip had been rejected as unacceptable to the German nobility.<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.75\"/> Philip had also been increasingly influenced over the years by first [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Queen Margaret]], and later the other, powerful Habsburg women at court, whilst the incoming set of advisors that replaced de Lerma, especially de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, also saw Spain's future as part of a strong alliance with a Habsburg Holy Roman Empire.<ref>Ringrose, p.320.</ref> Finally, by the [[O\u00f1ate treaty]] of 29 July 1617, Ferdinand made a successful appeal to Philip's self-interest by promising Spain the Habsburg lands in [[Alsace]] in return for Spanish support for his election.<ref>Wedgwood, p.57.</ref>\n\nCrisis broke out in Ferdinand's kingdom of [[Bohemia]] during 1618\u201319, with a confrontation between Catholic and Protestant factions. Ferdinand asked Spain for help to put down the rebellion; the Protestant rebels turned to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the Palatinate as a new ruler and Emperor. The situation in the Empire was in many ways auspicious for Spanish strategy; in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] [[Ambrosio Spinola, marqu\u00e9s de los Balbases|Ambrosio Spinola]] had been conspiring to find an opportunity to intervene with the [[Army of Flanders]] into the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The Palatinate was a vital, Protestant set of territories along the Rhine guarding the most obvious route for reinforcements from other Spanish territories to arrive into the rebellious Dutch provinces (through Genoa).<ref name=\"Wedgwood, pp.113-4\"/> France, assumed bound to support Frederick against Ferdinand, was in fact inclined to remain neutral.<ref>Wedgwood, p.110-1.</ref> The Spanish troops headed by Spinola in the Palatinate and by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] in Bohemia achieved a decisive victory against the Czechs in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. With the Dutch now vulnerable to a strike through the Rhine valley, a renewed war against the Provinces, with the aim of forcing the Dutch to a more suitable permanent peace, appeared inevitable.

The story told in the memoirs of the French ambassador [[Bassompierre]], that he was killed by the heat of a ''brasero'' (a pan of hot charcoal), because the proper official to take it away was not at hand, is a humorous exaggeration of the formal etiquette of the court.\n\nPhilip has generally left a poor legacy with historians.  Three major historians of the period have described an 'undistinguished and insignificant man',<ref name=\"Wedgwood, p.55\"/> a 'miserable monarch',<ref>Stradling, p.18.</ref> whose 'only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice'.<ref>Elliott, 1963, pp. 300\u2013301.</ref>  More generally, Philip has largely retained the reputation of 'a weak, dim-witted monarch who preferred hunting and traveling to governing'.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.92\">S\u00e1nchez, p.92.</ref>  Unlike Philip IV, whose reputation has improved significantly in the light of recent analysis, Philip III's reign has been relatively unstudied, possibly because of the negative interpretation given to the role of Philip and Lerma during the period.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez, p.92\"/>  Traditionally, the decline of Spain has been placed from the 1590s onwards; revisionist historians from the 1960s, however, presented an alternative analysis, arguing that in many ways Philip III's Spain of 1621 \u2013 reinforced with new territories in Alsace, at peace with France, dominant in the Holy Roman Empire, and about to begin a successful campaign against the Dutch \u2013 was in a much stronger position than in 1598, despite the poor personal performance of her king during the period.<ref>Parker, 1984, p.145.</ref>  Philip's use of Lerma as his ''valido'' has formed one of the key historical and contemporary criticisms against him; recent work<ref>In particular, Feros (2006) and Williams' (2006) recent extensive studies of the period, and S\u00e1nchez's (1996) analysis of the role of powerful women, often under-reported in historical documents, at Philip's court.</ref> has perhaps begun to present a more nuanced picture of the relationship and the institution that survived for the next forty years in Spanish royal government.\n\n==Titles and styles==\n[[File:Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_Spain_(1580-1668).svg|thumb|120px|Coat of arms of Philip III]]\n\nIn the 1604 [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], Philip was styled ''\"Philip the Third, by the grace of God, king of [[list of Castilian kings|Castile]], [[list of Leonese kings|Leon]], [[list of Aragonese kings|Aragon]] and the [[list of Sicilian kings|Two Sicilies]], [[list of kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[list of Portuguese kings|Portugal]], [[list of Navarrese kings|Navarre]], [[list of kings of Granada|Granada]], [[list of kings of Toledo|Toledo]], [[list of Valencian kings|Valencia]], [[list of Galician kings|Galicia]], the [[list of kings of Majorca|Majorcas]], [[list of kings of Seville|Seville]], [[list of kings of Cordoba|Cordoba]], [[list of Sardinian kings|Corsica]], [[list of Murcian kings|Murcia]], [[list of kings of Guinea|Guinea]], [[list of kings of the Algarve|Algarve]], [[list of kings of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], the [[list of kings of the Canary Islands|Canary Islands]], also of the Eastern and Western Indies, and the islands and ''[[Land mass|terra firma]]'' of the Ocean Sea, [[archduke of Austria]], duke of [[list of dukes of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[list of dukes of Milan|Milan]], count of [[list of counts of Habsburg|Habsburg]], [[list of counts of Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[list of counts of Biscay|Biscay]], and lord of [[list of lords of Molina|Molina]], etc.\"'' in full and \"Philip III, King of the Spains\" for short.<ref>Davenport, page number missing.</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\nLike many [[Habsburg]]s, Philip III was the product of extensive [[Human inbreeding|inbreeding]]. His father, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], a product of [[cousin marriage|marriage between first cousins]], married his niece, [[Anna of Austria (1549\u20131580)|Anna of Austria]], herself the product of a cousin couple.

This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the [[Bulbocavernosus Reflex|gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bridley | first1 = G.

Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular engorgement. On occasion, there may be no obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have a caring, skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect sexual satisfaction.\n\nSome social theorists {{who|date=July 2016}} believe that inability to orgasm may be related to residual psychosocial perceptions that female sexual desire is somehow 'wrong', and that this stems from the age of Victorian repression. It is thought that this view may impede some women \u2013 perhaps those raised in a more repressed environment \u2013 from being able to experience natural and healthy sexual feeling.<ref>Stern and Saunders \"Psychosocial Sexual Impediment: a Victorian Legacy? (UNC Chapel Hill, 2007){{Citation not found|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Secondary anorgasmia===\n\nSecondary anorgasmia is the loss of the ability to have orgasms (as opposed to primary anorgasmia which indicates a person who has never had an orgasm). Or loss of the ability to reach orgasm of past intensity. The cause may be alcoholism, depression, grief, pelvic surgery (such as total hysterectomy) or injuries, certain medications, [[death-grip]], illness, [[estrogen]] deprivation associated with [[menopause]], or rape.\n\n==== Prostatectomy ====\n[[Image:Prostatelead.jpg|thumb|The prostate and surrounding organs.]]\nSecondary anorgasmia is close to 50% among males undergoing [[prostatectomy]];<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Dunsmuir WD, Emberton M, Neal DE | title=There is significant sexual dissatisfaction following TURP | journal=British Journal of Urology | issue=77 | page= 161A}}</ref> 80% among radical prostatectomies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Koeman M, Van Driel MF, Weijmar Schultz WC, Mensink HJ | title=Orgasm after radical prostatectomy | journal=British Journal of Urology | issue=77 | pages=861\u201364}}</ref> This is generally caused by damage to the primary nerves serving the penile area, which pass near the prostate gland.  Removal of the prostate frequently damages or even completely removes these nerves, making sexual response unreasonably difficult.<ref name=\"Radical prostatectomy\"/> Radical prostatectomies are usually given to younger males who are expected to live more than 10 years.  At more advanced ages, the [[prostate]] is less likely to grow during that person's remaining lifetime.<ref name=\"Radical prostatectomy\">{{cite web|title=Radical Prostatectomy|work=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=6 December 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/radical-prostatectomy-operation}}</ref>\n\n===Situational anorgasmia===\nPeople who are orgasmic in some situations may not be in others. A person may have an orgasm from one type of stimulation but not from another, achieve orgasm with one partner but not another, or have an orgasm only under certain conditions or only with a certain type or amount of foreplay. These common variations are within the range of normal sexual expression and should not be considered problematic.\n\nA person who is troubled by experiencing situational anorgasmia should be encouraged to explore alone and with their partner those factors that may affect whether or not they are orgasmic, such as fatigue, emotional concerns, feeling pressured to have sex when they are not interested, or a partner's sexual dysfunction. In the relatively common case of female situational anorgasmia during penile-vaginal intercourse, some sex therapists recommend that couples incorporate manual or vibrator stimulation during intercourse, or using the female-above position as it may allow for greater stimulation of the clitoris by the [[penis]] or [[pubic symphysis]] or both, and it allows the woman better control of movement.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nEffective treatment for anorgasmia depends on the cause. In the case of women suffering from psychological sexual trauma or inhibition, [[psychosexual]] counselling might be advisable and could be obtained through [[general practitioner]] (GP) referral.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Humphery|first=S.|last2=Nazareth|first2=I.|date=2001-10-01|title=GPs' views on their management of sexual dysfunction|journal=Family Practice|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=516\u2013518|doi=10.1093/fampra/18.5.516|pmid=11604374|issn=0263-2136}}</ref>\n\nWomen suffering from anorgasmia with no obvious psychological cause would need to be examined by their GP to check for absence of disease.

This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the [[Bulbocavernosus Reflex|gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bridley | first1 = G.

Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular engorgement. On occasion, there may be no obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have a caring, skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect sexual satisfaction.\n\nSome social theorists {{who|date=July 2016}} believe that inability to orgasm may be related to residual psychosocial perceptions that female sexual desire is somehow 'wrong', and that this stems from the age of Victorian repression. It is thought that this view may impede some women \u2013 perhaps those raised in a more repressed environment \u2013 from being able to experience natural and healthy sexual feeling.<ref>Stern and Saunders \"Psychosocial Sexual Impediment: a Victorian Legacy?

Or loss of the ability to reach orgasm of past intensity. The cause may be alcoholism, depression, grief, pelvic surgery (such as total hysterectomy) or injuries, certain medications, [[death-grip]], illness, [[estrogen]] deprivation associated with [[menopause]], or rape.\n\n==== Prostatectomy ====\n[[Image:Prostatelead.jpg|thumb|The prostate and surrounding organs.]]\nSecondary anorgasmia is close to 50% among males undergoing [[prostatectomy]];<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Dunsmuir WD, Emberton M, Neal DE | title=There is significant sexual dissatisfaction following TURP | journal=British Journal of Urology | issue=77 | page= 161A}}</ref> 80% among radical prostatectomies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Koeman M, Van Driel MF, Weijmar Schultz WC, Mensink HJ | title=Orgasm after radical prostatectomy | journal=British Journal of Urology | issue=77 | pages=861\u201364}}</ref> This is generally caused by damage to the primary nerves serving the penile area, which pass near the prostate gland.

A person may have an orgasm from one type of stimulation but not from another, achieve orgasm with one partner but not another, or have an orgasm only under certain conditions or only with a certain type or amount of foreplay. These common variations are within the range of normal sexual expression and should not be considered problematic.\n\nA person who is troubled by experiencing situational anorgasmia should be encouraged to explore alone and with their partner those factors that may affect whether or not they are orgasmic, such as fatigue, emotional concerns, feeling pressured to have sex when they are not interested, or a partner's sexual dysfunction. In the relatively common case of female situational anorgasmia during penile-vaginal intercourse, some sex therapists recommend that couples incorporate manual or vibrator stimulation during intercourse, or using the female-above position as it may allow for greater stimulation of the clitoris by the [[penis]] or [[pubic symphysis]] or both, and it allows the woman better control of movement.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nEffective treatment for anorgasmia depends on the cause. In the case of women suffering from psychological sexual trauma or inhibition, [[psychosexual]] counselling might be advisable and could be obtained through [[general practitioner]] (GP) referral.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Humphery|first=S.|last2=Nazareth|first2=I.|date=2001-10-01|title=GPs' views on their management of sexual dysfunction|journal=Family Practice|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=516\u2013518|doi=10.1093/fampra/18.5.516|pmid=11604374|issn=0263-2136}}</ref>\n\nWomen suffering from anorgasmia with no obvious psychological cause would need to be examined by their GP to check for absence of disease.

If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an [[archipelago]], at least until [[isostasy]] lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}} at latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63\u00b0]]\u2013[[65th parallel north|65\u00b0N]]; the northern dome reaches about {{convert|3290|m|ft|-2}} at about latitude [[72nd parallel north|72\u00b0N]] (the fourth highest [[list of mountain peaks of Greenland|\"summit\" of Greenland]]). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of [[Melville Bay]] southeast of Thule. Large [[outlet glacier]]s, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is [[Jakobshavn Glacier]] ({{lang-kl|Sermeq Kujalleq}}), which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of {{convert|20|to|22|m|ft|0|disp=or}} per day.\n\nOn the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about {{convert|-31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== Change of the ice sheet ==\n[[File:Greenland Meltdown 08072012 12072012.jpg|350px|thumb|Melting ice during July 2012, images created by [[NASA]] show the process in the summer]]\n[[File:NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour of Greenland\u2019s moving ice sheet.ogv|350px|thumb|NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour about Greenland's ice sheet.]]\n=== The ice sheet as a record of past climates ===\n{{See also|Greenland ice core project|Greenland Ice Sheet Project}}\nThe ice sheet, consisting of layers of compressed snow from more than 100,000 years, contains in its ice today's most valuable record of past climates.

The first is the enhanced meltwater effect, which relies on additional surface melting, funneled through [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]] reaching the glacier base and reducing the friction through a higher basal water pressure. (Not all [[meltwater]] is retained in the [[ice sheet]] and some moulins drain into the ocean, with varying rapidity.)  This idea was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of up to 20% on Sermeq Kujalleq in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp.<ref>\"Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow by Zwally et al., \"[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/5579/218]</ref>\n(The acceleration lasted between two and three months and was less than 10% in 1996 and 1997 for example. They offered a conclusion that the \"coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming\". Examination of recent rapid supra-glacial lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events, but they had little significance to the annual flow of the large outlet glaciers.<ref>\"Fracture Propagation to the Base of the Greenland Ice Sheet During Supraglacial Lake Drainage by Das. et al.,\" [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1153360]</ref>\n\nThe second mechanism is a force imbalance at the [[Ice calving|calving]] front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows for an increase in velocity. This is akin to letting off the [[Parking brake|emergency brake]] a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction.<ref>\"Thomas R.H (2004), Force-perturbation analysis of recent thinning and acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, Journal of Glaciology 50 (168): 57\u201366.\n\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = R.

If the force imbalance effect is the key, then the velocity will propagate up-glacier, there will be no seasonal cycle, and the acceleration will be focused on calving glaciers.\nHelheim Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus from the 1970s\u20132000.

However, there are only a small number of weather stations on the island, and though satellite data can examine the entire island, it has only been available since the early 1990s, making the study of trends difficult. It has been observed that there is more precipitation where it is warmer, up to 1.5 meters per year on the southeast flank, and less precipitation or none on the 25\u201380 percent (depending on the time of year) of the island that is cooler.<ref>\"Modelling Precipitation over ice sheets: an assessment using Greenland\", Gerard H.

These are\n\n# Accumulation and melting rates of snow in the central parts\n# Melting of surface snow and ice which then flows into [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]], falls and flows to bedrock, lubricates the base of glaciers, and affects the speed of [[glacial motion]]. This flow is implicated in [[#Ice sheet acceleration|accelerating the speed of glaciers]] and thus the rate of [[Ice calving|glacial calving]].\n# Melting of ice along the sheet's margins (runoff) and basal hydrology,\n# Iceberg calving into the sea from outlet glaciers also along the sheet's edges\nExplanation of accelerated glacial coastward movement and iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased weight of the central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice sheet thickness exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed on the surface and later disappeared under the ice.<ref>Wikipedia,</ref> A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F ''Lightning'' World War II fighter plane ''Glacier Girl'' that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years. It was recovered by members of the Greenland Expedition Society after years of searching and excavation, eventually transported to Kentucky and restored to flying condition.\n\nThe [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] (2001) estimated the accumulation to 520&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;26 [[Gigatonne]]s of ice per year, runoff and bottom melting to 297\u00b132&nbsp;Gt/yr and 32\u00b13&nbsp;Gt/yr, respectively, and iceberg production to 235\u00b133&nbsp;Gt/yr. On balance, the IPCC estimates \u221244&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;53&nbsp;Gt/yr, which means that the ice sheet may currently be melting.<ref name=\"IPCC-2001\" /> Data from 1996 to 2005 shows that the ice sheet is thinning even faster than supposed by IPCC.

If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an [[archipelago]], at least until [[isostasy]] lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}} at latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63\u00b0]]\u2013[[65th parallel north|65\u00b0N]]; the northern dome reaches about {{convert|3290|m|ft|-2}} at about latitude [[72nd parallel north|72\u00b0N]] (the fourth highest [[list of mountain peaks of Greenland|\"summit\" of Greenland]]). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of [[Melville Bay]] southeast of Thule. Large [[outlet glacier]]s, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is [[Jakobshavn Glacier]] ({{lang-kl|Sermeq Kujalleq}}), which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of {{convert|20|to|22|m|ft|0|disp=or}} per day.\n\nOn the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about {{convert|-31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== Change of the ice sheet ==\n[[File:Greenland Meltdown 08072012 12072012.jpg|350px|thumb|Melting ice during July 2012, images created by [[NASA]] show the process in the summer]]\n[[File:NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour of Greenland\u2019s moving ice sheet.ogv|350px|thumb|NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour about Greenland's ice sheet.]]\n=== The ice sheet as a record of past climates ===\n{{See also|Greenland ice core project|Greenland Ice Sheet Project}}\nThe ice sheet, consisting of layers of compressed snow from more than 100,000 years, contains in its ice today's most valuable record of past climates.

The first is the enhanced meltwater effect, which relies on additional surface melting, funneled through [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]] reaching the glacier base and reducing the friction through a higher basal water pressure. (Not all [[meltwater]] is retained in the [[ice sheet]] and some moulins drain into the ocean, with varying rapidity.)  This idea was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of up to 20% on Sermeq Kujalleq in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp.<ref>\"Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow by Zwally et al., \"[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/5579/218]</ref>\n(The acceleration lasted between two and three months and was less than 10% in 1996 and 1997 for example. They offered a conclusion that the \"coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming\". Examination of recent rapid supra-glacial lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events, but they had little significance to the annual flow of the large outlet glaciers.<ref>\"Fracture Propagation to the Base of the Greenland Ice Sheet During Supraglacial Lake Drainage by Das. et al.,\" [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1153360]</ref>\n\nThe second mechanism is a force imbalance at the [[Ice calving|calving]] front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows for an increase in velocity. This is akin to letting off the [[Parking brake|emergency brake]] a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction.<ref>\"Thomas R.H (2004), Force-perturbation analysis of recent thinning and acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, Journal of Glaciology 50 (168): 57\u201366.\n\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = R.

If the force imbalance effect is the key, then the velocity will propagate up-glacier, there will be no seasonal cycle, and the acceleration will be focused on calving glaciers.\nHelheim Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus from the 1970s\u20132000.

However, there are only a small number of weather stations on the island, and though satellite data can examine the entire island, it has only been available since the early 1990s, making the study of trends difficult. It has been observed that there is more precipitation where it is warmer, up to 1.5 meters per year on the southeast flank, and less precipitation or none on the 25\u201380 percent (depending on the time of year) of the island that is cooler.<ref>\"Modelling Precipitation over ice sheets: an assessment using Greenland\", Gerard H.

These are\n\n# Accumulation and melting rates of snow in the central parts\n# Melting of surface snow and ice which then flows into [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]], falls and flows to bedrock, lubricates the base of glaciers, and affects the speed of [[glacial motion]]. This flow is implicated in [[#Ice sheet acceleration|accelerating the speed of glaciers]] and thus the rate of [[Ice calving|glacial calving]].\n# Melting of ice along the sheet's margins (runoff) and basal hydrology,\n# Iceberg calving into the sea from outlet glaciers also along the sheet's edges\nExplanation of accelerated glacial coastward movement and iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased weight of the central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice sheet thickness exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed on the surface and later disappeared under the ice.<ref>Wikipedia,</ref> A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F ''Lightning'' World War II fighter plane ''Glacier Girl'' that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years. It was recovered by members of the Greenland Expedition Society after years of searching and excavation, eventually transported to Kentucky and restored to flying condition.\n\nThe [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] (2001) estimated the accumulation to 520&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;26 [[Gigatonne]]s of ice per year, runoff and bottom melting to 297\u00b132&nbsp;Gt/yr and 32\u00b13&nbsp;Gt/yr, respectively, and iceberg production to 235\u00b133&nbsp;Gt/yr. On balance, the IPCC estimates \u221244&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;53&nbsp;Gt/yr, which means that the ice sheet may currently be melting.<ref name=\"IPCC-2001\" /> Data from 1996 to 2005 shows that the ice sheet is thinning even faster than supposed by IPCC.

Mulayam termed the national convention as illegal and directly expelled his cousin, Ram Gopal Yadav, who had convened the national executive convention. But the Election commission of India ruled that Ram Gopal Yadav had the right to convene that executive convention, and reversed Mulayam's order. Hence Akhilesh Yadav officially became the new National Leader of the party.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book|title=India's silent revolution: Rise of lower castes in North India|year=2003|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot |publisher=C.

One of the groups, led by Akhilesh, enjoyed the support of his father's cousin and National General Secretary [[Ram Gopal Yadav]]. The rival group was led by Mulayam Singh and supported by his brother and State Chief of Party, Shivpal Yadav, and a friend, MP [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]]. Akhilesh had fired his uncle twice from his cabinet as it was seen by many as a direct challenge to his father, who has steadily supported Shivpal over Akhilesh.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/53902522.cms|title=Infighting erupts in ruling Yadav family in UP, Mulayam continues to pull the power strings|last=Rai|first=Manmohan|date=|work=[[The Economic Times]]|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref> On 30 December 2016, Mulayam Yadav expelled his son Akhilesh and his cousin Ram Gopal from the party for six years on the grounds of indiscipline, only to revoke the decision 24 hours later. Akhilesh, in response, stripped his father off the party presidency and instead named him the chief patron of the party following the national convention of the party on 1 January 2017. Mulayam termed the national convention as illegal and directly expelled his cousin, Ram Gopal Yadav, who had convened the national executive convention. But the Election commission of India ruled that Ram Gopal Yadav had the right to convene that executive convention, and reversed Mulayam's order. Hence Akhilesh Yadav officially became the new National Leader of the party.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book|title=India's silent revolution: Rise of lower castes in North India|year=2003|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot |publisher=C.
