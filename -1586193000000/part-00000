The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|\u00f0|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning \"the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]\". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''.

Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].\n\n[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller, memorials.\n\nIn addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.\n\nCardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides \u2013 Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two Motte and Bailey castles in Radyr and Rhiwbina (both known as the \"Twmpath\", a Welsh word for a small mound),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as Castell Morgraig. Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of these castles is indicative of the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.\n\nWhile not strictly castles in the historic sense, there is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], a fortified residence belonging to the Bishops of Llandaff and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]], a preserved seventeenth century manor house, once the seat of the Earls of Plymouth.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n|<gallery caption=\"Cardiff's castles\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Cardiff Castle - panoramio (1).jpg|Cardiff Castle\nFile:Castell Coch - exterior.JPG|Castell Coch \nFile:St Fagans castle - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1458954.jpg|St Fagans Castle\nFile:Bishop's Palace, Llandaff 2011 5.jpg|Bishop's Palace, Llandaff\n</gallery>\n|}\nOther major tourist attractions are the [[Cardiff Bay]] regeneration sites which include the recently opened Wales Millennium Centre and the Senedd, and many other cultural and sites of interest including the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]] and the famous [[Coal Exchange]].

The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|\u00f0|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning \"the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]\". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''.

Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].\n\n[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller, memorials.\n\nIn addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.\n\nCardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides \u2013 Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two Motte and Bailey castles in Radyr and Rhiwbina (both known as the \"Twmpath\", a Welsh word for a small mound),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as Castell Morgraig. Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of these castles is indicative of the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.\n\nWhile not strictly castles in the historic sense, there is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], a fortified residence belonging to the Bishops of Llandaff and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]], a preserved seventeenth century manor house, once the seat of the Earls of Plymouth.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n|<gallery caption=\"Cardiff's castles\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Cardiff Castle - panoramio (1).jpg|Cardiff Castle\nFile:Castell Coch - exterior.JPG|Castell Coch \nFile:St Fagans castle - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1458954.jpg|St Fagans Castle\nFile:Bishop's Palace, Llandaff 2011 5.jpg|Bishop's Palace, Llandaff\n</gallery>\n|}\nOther major tourist attractions are the [[Cardiff Bay]] regeneration sites which include the recently opened Wales Millennium Centre and the Senedd, and many other cultural and sites of interest including the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]] and the famous [[Coal Exchange]].

He has won three [[men's major golf championships|major championships]]: [[The Open Championship]] in [[2007 Open Championship|2007]] and [[2008 Open Championship|2008]] and the [[PGA Championship]], also in [[2008 PGA Championship|2008]]. He spent over 300 weeks in [[List of male golfers who have been in the world top 10|the top-10 of the world rankings]], and reached a career-high ranking of third in July 2008.\n\nHe is the captain of the European team for the [[2020 Ryder Cup]].\n\n==Background==\nHarrington was born in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the youngest of five sons of Patrick and Breda Harrington. His father, [[Paddy Harrington|\"Paddy\"]] (1933\u20132005), a [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] who played [[Gaelic football]] for [[Cork GAA|Cork]] in the 1950s, was also a [[boxing|boxer]] and [[hurling|hurler]], and played to a five handicap in golf.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golfworld/2006/09/200609615rosaforte |title=Paddy's Boy |magazine=Golf Digest |first=Tim |last=Rosaforte |date=15 September 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe grew up in [[Rathfarnham]], an area on Dublin's southside and the birthplace of two other professional golfers, [[Paul McGinley]] and [[Peter Lawrie]]. Harrington attended the same local secondary school as McGinley (though not in the same year), giving their school, [[Col\u00e1iste \u00c9anna]], the unique distinction of having produced two [[Ryder Cup]] captains. Encouraged by his brothers and father, Harrington's interest and passion for golf grew as he developed his game at nearby Stackstown G.C.\n\n==Professional career==\n===European Tour (1996-2007)===\nAfter a successful amateur career, including winning the [[Walker Cup]] with the Great Britain & Ireland team in his third appearance in 1995,<ref>{{cite news |last=Glover |first=Tim |date=11 September 1995 |title=Walker Cup glory as Americans humbled |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/walker-cup-glory-as-americans-humbled-1600596.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Harrington turned professional later that year, joining the European Tour in 1996.<ref name=ETBio>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/players/playerid=293/bio/index.html |title=European Tour Biography |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Harrington came to professional golf at a relatively late age, having studied [[accountancy]] at university for a number of years while playing high-standard amateur golf.<ref name=ESPNprof>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/golf/sport/player/1367.html |title=ESPN profile |work=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> He was unsure whether to turn professional, initially doubting his skills.\n\nHis first victory came quickly, in the 1996 [[Peugeot Spanish Open]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Newell |first1=Steve |last2=Farrell |first2=Andy |last3=Carr |first3=Steve |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Golf Book: The Players / The Gear / The Strokes / The Courses / The Championships |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page=190 |isbn=9781405322386}}</ref> his 10th start on the European Tour.

Both players went into the playoff having shot a 7-under 277 for the championship. Harrington subsequently won by one stroke in the playoff.\n\nA year later at the [[2008 Open Championship]], it was unclear if he would get a chance to defend his Open title at [[Royal Birkdale]] as eight days prior to the event he injured his wrist. But Harrington successfully defended his title, overcoming a 2-shot deficit to [[Greg Norman]] with a final round 69. He shot a four-under-par 32 on the back nine, which enabled him to pull away from Norman and [[Ian Poulter]]. His eagle on the par-5 17th all but sealed the tournament. He is the first European golfer since [[James Braid (golfer)|James Braid]] in 1906 to retain the [[Claret Jug]]. The win moved him from fourteenth to third in the world rankings, behind only [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Phil Mickelson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/2008/july/week-29 |title=Week 29 \u2013 Padraig Harrington Retains the Open Championship and Jumps to World Number Three |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nJust three weeks after winning the Open Championship, Harrington won the [[2008 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] over the South Course of the [[Oakland Hills Country Club]], for his third [[Men's major golf championships|major]]. Although at five over par after two rounds, he shot eight under par for the weekend, carding successive scores of 66 in the third and fourth rounds. His three under par 277 was two shots ahead of [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]] and [[Ben Curtis (golfer)|Ben Curtis]]. Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years ([[Tommy Armour]] in 1930), and was the first winner from Ireland.\n\nAside from [[Tiger Woods]], who has won consecutive majors three times (2000, 2002, and 2006), Harrington was the first golfer to win two majors in the same year since [[Mark O'Meara]] in 1998 and the first to win consecutive majors in the same year since [[Nick Price]] in 1994. A feat that has since been achieved by [[Rory McIlroy]] in 2014, winning the Open Championship and PGA Championship, as well as [[Jordan Spieth]] who won the Masters and the U.S. Open in 2015.\n\nHarrington's victory in the PGA Championship secured his position as the number one player in Europe, earning him a spot in the 2008 European [[2008 Ryder Cup|Ryder Cup]] team under captain [[Nick Faldo]].\n\n===2009: First winless year for a decade===\nHarrington started his 2009 season with a tied-fifth finish in the [[Abu Dhabi Golf Championship]] on the [[European Tour]]. He then went through a tough period in his career, missing the cut at the [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]], as well as the [[Northern Trust Open]] on the PGA Tour. He finished tied-11th at the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] in what would be one of his better results in the early part of 2009. He arrived at the [[2009 Masters Tournament]] hoping to join [[Ben Hogan]] and [[Tiger Woods]] as the only players to win three consecutive professional majors. Harrington started with a 3-under-par first round, but eventually faded over the weekend, finishing tied for 35th place. His struggles continued in the succeeding months, as he missed the cut at five of his next six events, including [[The 3 Irish Open]] and the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. It was during this period that he announced that he was working on swing changes with coach Bob Torrance.\n\nHarrington arrived at [[The Open Championship]] at Turnberry hoping to complete a hat-trick of Open wins, a feat that has only been achieved since the 1880s by [[Peter Thomson (golfer)|Peter Thomson]]. He ended up finishing tied for 65th place. At the [[WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]] he was involved in a final day head-to-head between himself and World number one [[Tiger Woods]]. Harrington led by one shot playing the 16th hole, but he racked up a triple-bogey to Woods' birdie and he finished in joint 2nd place. The following week Harrington, the defending champion, played the first two rounds with Woods at the [[PGA Championship]]. He shot a first round 68, ending one shot behind the leader Woods. Rounds of 73 and 69 left him two shots behind Woods. He was in contention in the final round, until he made an 8 at the par-3 8th hole. He ended in a tie for 10th. He finished in the top-10 in all four [[FedEx Cup]] playoff events, before further top-10s in Europe and the States before the end of the season. He ended the year winless on the European and PGA Tours for the first time since 1999.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\n[[File:Padraig Harrington.jpg|thumb|Harrington at the 2014 Open de France.]]\nHarrington missed the cut in three out of the four majors in 2010. In an inconsistent season, he had five top-10s on the PGA Tour, but also missed six cuts. He was a controversial wild-card pick by European captain [[Colin Montgomerie]] for the [[2010 Ryder Cup]]. He won two matches and lost two matches as Europe regained the Ryder Cup. It was his sixth Ryder Cup and fourth time being on the winning team. He won his first tournament in two years at the [[Iskandar Johor Open]] in Malaysia on the [[Asian Tour]]. He finished the year ranked 25th in the world.\n\nHarrington started his 2011 season with an opening round 65, for a first round lead at the [[Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship]] on the European Tour. He was later disqualified before his second round commenced, after a spectator telephoned in and pointed out an incident of his ball moving an exceptionally small distance closer to the hole on the green, while he was replacing his ball marker, during the first round; it had been shown on television. (The incident led to a rules review, and if it were to occur again, would not be a penalty.) He missed the cut at the [[Masters Tournament]] and finished tied for 45th at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. In June 2011, he dropped outside the top 50 in the World Rankings for the first time since 1999.\n\nHarrington made his first start of the 2012 PGA Tour season at the [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]] where he finished joint top of the Pro-Am leaderboard, alongside partner [[J.P. McManus]], with [[Brian Harman]] and [[Greg Ontiveros]]. Harrington also enjoyed a good finish in the overall tournament with a tied for seventh finish. In March 2012, Harrington shot a 61 in the first round of the [[Transitions Championship]] to set a new course record at the Copperhead Course. This was also Harrington's lowest ever round on the PGA Tour. He could not maintain his brilliant first day's play over the remaining three rounds though and finished in a tie for 20th place.\n\nIn April 2012, at the first major of the year, [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]], Harrington shot five under for the last six holes in his third round to close to within three shots of the lead. In the final round, he shot a level par round of 72 to finish tied for 8th. It was Harrington's first top-10 finish in a major since the 2009 PGA Championship.\n\nAt the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|2012 U.S. Open]], Harrington was in contention to win a fourth major championship, when rounds of 74-70-71 on the first three days got him into contention on Sunday. After bogeying two of the first six holes, Harrington preceded to play the stretch from hole 7\u201317 in 5-under-par to find himself two behind the leader. Needing a birdie at the last to finish ahead of the clubhouse leader [[Michael Thompson (golfer)|Michael Thompson]], Harrington took the pin on at the 18th and found a plugged lie in the greenside bunker, which resulted in a bogey finish at 3-over-par. Ultimately this did not cost him the championship as he finished two shots behind [[Webb Simpson]] on 1-over-par. Harrington later stated that he thought he had to birdie the last to get to 1-over-par as the reason for taking such an aggressive line on the 18th. He eventually finished in a tie for fourth place, which represented his best showing at a [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]].\n\nIn October 2012 Harrington won the [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]] despite having not won a major championship during the year, having been a late replacement for [[The Open Championship|Open]] champion [[Ernie Els]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/20052753 |title=PGA Grand Slam: Padraig Harrington wins in Bermuda |date=24 October 2012 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref>\n\nHarrington endured difficult 2013 and 2014 seasons finishing outside of the top 60 on the [[European Tour]] Race to Dubai in both years and outside of the top 130 on the [[PGA Tour]] FedEx Cup in both years.

Tour]] and the [[PGA Tour]]. He has won three [[men's major golf championships|major championships]]: [[The Open Championship]] in [[2007 Open Championship|2007]] and [[2008 Open Championship|2008]] and the [[PGA Championship]], also in [[2008 PGA Championship|2008]]. He spent over 300 weeks in [[List of male golfers who have been in the world top 10|the top-10 of the world rankings]], and reached a career-high ranking of third in July 2008.\n\nHe is the captain of the European team for the [[2020 Ryder Cup]].\n\n==Background==\nHarrington was born in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the youngest of five sons of Patrick and Breda Harrington. His father, [[Paddy Harrington|\"Paddy\"]] (1933\u20132005), a [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] who played [[Gaelic football]] for [[Cork GAA|Cork]] in the 1950s, was also a [[boxing|boxer]] and [[hurling|hurler]], and played to a five handicap in golf.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golfworld/2006/09/200609615rosaforte |title=Paddy's Boy |magazine=Golf Digest |first=Tim |last=Rosaforte |date=15 September 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe grew up in [[Rathfarnham]], an area on Dublin's southside and the birthplace of two other professional golfers, [[Paul McGinley]] and [[Peter Lawrie]]. Harrington attended the same local secondary school as McGinley (though not in the same year), giving their school, [[Col\u00e1iste \u00c9anna]], the unique distinction of having produced two [[Ryder Cup]] captains. Encouraged by his brothers and father, Harrington's interest and passion for golf grew as he developed his game at nearby Stackstown G.C.\n\n==Professional career==\n===European Tour (1996-2007)===\nAfter a successful amateur career, including winning the [[Walker Cup]] with the Great Britain & Ireland team in his third appearance in 1995,<ref>{{cite news |last=Glover |first=Tim |date=11 September 1995 |title=Walker Cup glory as Americans humbled |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/walker-cup-glory-as-americans-humbled-1600596.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Harrington turned professional later that year, joining the European Tour in 1996.<ref name=ETBio>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/players/playerid=293/bio/index.html |title=European Tour Biography |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Harrington came to professional golf at a relatively late age, having studied [[accountancy]] at university for a number of years while playing high-standard amateur golf.<ref name=ESPNprof>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/golf/sport/player/1367.html |title=ESPN profile |work=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> He was unsure whether to turn professional, initially doubting his skills.\n\nHis first victory came quickly, in the 1996 [[Peugeot Spanish Open]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Newell |first1=Steve |last2=Farrell |first2=Andy |last3=Carr |first3=Steve |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Golf Book: The Players / The Gear / The Strokes / The Courses / The Championships |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page=190 |isbn=9781405322386}}</ref> his 10th start on the European Tour.

Both players went into the playoff having shot a 7-under 277 for the championship. Harrington subsequently won by one stroke in the playoff.\n\nA year later at the [[2008 Open Championship]], it was unclear if he would get a chance to defend his Open title at [[Royal Birkdale]] as eight days prior to the event he injured his wrist. But Harrington successfully defended his title, overcoming a 2-shot deficit to [[Greg Norman]] with a final round 69. He shot a four-under-par 32 on the back nine, which enabled him to pull away from Norman and [[Ian Poulter]]. His eagle on the par-5 17th all but sealed the tournament. He is the first European golfer since [[James Braid (golfer)|James Braid]] in 1906 to retain the [[Claret Jug]]. The win moved him from fourteenth to third in the world rankings, behind only [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Phil Mickelson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/2008/july/week-29 |title=Week 29 \u2013 Padraig Harrington Retains the Open Championship and Jumps to World Number Three |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nJust three weeks after winning the Open Championship, Harrington won the [[2008 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] over the South Course of the [[Oakland Hills Country Club]], for his third [[Men's major golf championships|major]]. Although at five over par after two rounds, he shot eight under par for the weekend, carding successive scores of 66 in the third and fourth rounds. His three under par 277 was two shots ahead of [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]] and [[Ben Curtis (golfer)|Ben Curtis]]. Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years ([[Tommy Armour]] in 1930), and was the first winner from Ireland.\n\nAside from [[Tiger Woods]], who has won consecutive majors three times (2000, 2002, and 2006), Harrington was the first golfer to win two majors in the same year since [[Mark O'Meara]] in 1998 and the first to win consecutive majors in the same year since [[Nick Price]] in 1994. A feat that has since been achieved by [[Rory McIlroy]] in 2014, winning the Open Championship and PGA Championship, as well as [[Jordan Spieth]] who won the Masters and the U.S. Open in 2015.\n\nHarrington's victory in the PGA Championship secured his position as the number one player in Europe, earning him a spot in the 2008 European [[2008 Ryder Cup|Ryder Cup]] team under captain [[Nick Faldo]].\n\n===2009: First winless year for a decade===\nHarrington started his 2009 season with a tied-fifth finish in the [[Abu Dhabi Golf Championship]] on the [[European Tour]]. He then went through a tough period in his career, missing the cut at the [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]], as well as the [[Northern Trust Open]] on the PGA Tour. He finished tied-11th at the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] in what would be one of his better results in the early part of 2009. He arrived at the [[2009 Masters Tournament]] hoping to join [[Ben Hogan]] and [[Tiger Woods]] as the only players to win three consecutive professional majors. Harrington started with a 3-under-par first round, but eventually faded over the weekend, finishing tied for 35th place. His struggles continued in the succeeding months, as he missed the cut at five of his next six events, including [[The 3 Irish Open]] and the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. It was during this period that he announced that he was working on swing changes with coach Bob Torrance.\n\nHarrington arrived at [[The Open Championship]] at Turnberry hoping to complete a hat-trick of Open wins, a feat that has only been achieved since the 1880s by [[Peter Thomson (golfer)|Peter Thomson]]. He ended up finishing tied for 65th place. At the [[WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]] he was involved in a final day head-to-head between himself and World number one [[Tiger Woods]]. Harrington led by one shot playing the 16th hole, but he racked up a triple-bogey to Woods' birdie and he finished in joint 2nd place. The following week Harrington, the defending champion, played the first two rounds with Woods at the [[PGA Championship]]. He shot a first round 68, ending one shot behind the leader Woods. Rounds of 73 and 69 left him two shots behind Woods. He was in contention in the final round, until he made an 8 at the par-3 8th hole. He ended in a tie for 10th. He finished in the top-10 in all four [[FedEx Cup]] playoff events, before further top-10s in Europe and the States before the end of the season. He ended the year winless on the European and PGA Tours for the first time since 1999.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\n[[File:Padraig Harrington.jpg|thumb|Harrington at the 2014 Open de France.]]\nHarrington missed the cut in three out of the four majors in 2010. In an inconsistent season, he had five top-10s on the PGA Tour, but also missed six cuts. He was a controversial wild-card pick by European captain [[Colin Montgomerie]] for the [[2010 Ryder Cup]]. He won two matches and lost two matches as Europe regained the Ryder Cup. It was his sixth Ryder Cup and fourth time being on the winning team. He won his first tournament in two years at the [[Iskandar Johor Open]] in Malaysia on the [[Asian Tour]]. He finished the year ranked 25th in the world.\n\nHarrington started his 2011 season with an opening round 65, for a first round lead at the [[Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship]] on the European Tour. He was later disqualified before his second round commenced, after a spectator telephoned in and pointed out an incident of his ball moving an exceptionally small distance closer to the hole on the green, while he was replacing his ball marker, during the first round; it had been shown on television. (The incident led to a rules review, and if it were to occur again, would not be a penalty.) He missed the cut at the [[Masters Tournament]] and finished tied for 45th at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. In June 2011, he dropped outside the top 50 in the World Rankings for the first time since 1999.\n\nHarrington made his first start of the 2012 PGA Tour season at the [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]] where he finished joint top of the Pro-Am leaderboard, alongside partner [[J.P. McManus]], with [[Brian Harman]] and [[Greg Ontiveros]]. Harrington also enjoyed a good finish in the overall tournament with a tied for seventh finish. In March 2012, Harrington shot a 61 in the first round of the [[Transitions Championship]] to set a new course record at the Copperhead Course. This was also Harrington's lowest ever round on the PGA Tour. He could not maintain his brilliant first day's play over the remaining three rounds though and finished in a tie for 20th place.\n\nIn April 2012, at the first major of the year, [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]], Harrington shot five under for the last six holes in his third round to close to within three shots of the lead. In the final round, he shot a level par round of 72 to finish tied for 8th. It was Harrington's first top-10 finish in a major since the 2009 PGA Championship.\n\nAt the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|2012 U.S. Open]], Harrington was in contention to win a fourth major championship, when rounds of 74-70-71 on the first three days got him into contention on Sunday. After bogeying two of the first six holes, Harrington preceded to play the stretch from hole 7\u201317 in 5-under-par to find himself two behind the leader. Needing a birdie at the last to finish ahead of the clubhouse leader [[Michael Thompson (golfer)|Michael Thompson]], Harrington took the pin on at the 18th and found a plugged lie in the greenside bunker, which resulted in a bogey finish at 3-over-par. Ultimately this did not cost him the championship as he finished two shots behind [[Webb Simpson]] on 1-over-par. Harrington later stated that he thought he had to birdie the last to get to 1-over-par as the reason for taking such an aggressive line on the 18th. He eventually finished in a tie for fourth place, which represented his best showing at a [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]].\n\nIn October 2012 Harrington won the [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]] despite having not won a major championship during the year, having been a late replacement for [[The Open Championship|Open]] champion [[Ernie Els]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/20052753 |title=PGA Grand Slam: Padraig Harrington wins in Bermuda |date=24 October 2012 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref>\n\nHarrington endured difficult 2013 and 2014 seasons finishing outside of the top 60 on the [[European Tour]] Race to Dubai in both years and outside of the top 130 on the [[PGA Tour]] FedEx Cup in both years.

Unsepttrium has an atomic mass of 507. Unsepttrium might be radioactive because it is a superheavy element and many superheavy elements are radioactive. Unsepttrium might be essential to life. If so it will be the third alkali metal essential to the human body after sodium and potassium , two other alkali metals that already exist. Unsepttrium has an electron configuration of Usb 6g1. Unsepttrium can lose its only valence electron forming the Ust+ ion forming compounds with the halogens forming salts that might be essential to humans. Unsepttrium might be synthetic.
