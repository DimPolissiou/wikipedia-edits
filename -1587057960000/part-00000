Collectively, the fans of a particular object or person constitute its fanbase or [[fandom]]. They may show their [[enthusiasm]] in a variety of ways, such as by promoting the object of their interest, being members of a [[fan club]], holding or participating in [[fan convention]]s, or writing [[fan mail]]. They may also engage in creative activities (\"[[fan labor]]\") such as creating [[fanzine]]s, writing [[fan fiction]], making memes or drawing [[fan art]].\n\n==Etymology==\nMerriam-Webster, the Oxford dictionary and other sources define \"fan\" as a shortened version of the word ''fanatic''.  ''[[Fanaticism|Fanatic]]'' itself, introduced into English around 1550, means \"marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion\". It comes from the Modern [[Latin (language)|Latin]] ''fanaticus'', meaning \"insanely but divinely inspired\". The word originally pertained to a [[temple]] or sacred place [Latin ''fanum'', poetic English ''fane'']. The modern sense of \"extremely zealous\" dates from around 1647; the use of ''fanatic'' as a noun dates from 1650. However, the term \"fancy\" for an intense liking of something (a usage attested by 1545<ref>{{cite web|title=\"fancy, v.\" OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68026|date=July 2018|url-access=subscription|accessdate=2018-10-16}}</ref>), while being of a different etymology, coincidentally carries a less intense but somewhat similar connotation to \"fanatic\". Use of \"the fancy\" to mean avid sports enthusiasts emerged as an [[American English|Americanism]] in the mid-19th C.<ref name=\"BBCblog\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-34298659 |title=The Vocabularist: Are fans fanatical or fanciful? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref> ''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'' cites William Henry Nugent's work asserting that it was derived from ''the fancy'', a term referring to the fans of a specific hobby or sport from the early 18th century to the 19th, especially to the followers of [[boxing]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fan&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Fan (n.2)|author=Douglas Harper |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> According to that theory, it was originally shortened to ''fance'' then just to the homonym ''fans''.{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} ''The Great American Baseball Scrapbook'' attributes the term to [[Chris Von der Ahe]], owner of the Saint Louis Brown Stockings in 1882. Von der Ahe sold tickets for 25 cents, hoping the many patrons would purchase his beer; the low ticket price helped him lead the stats in attendance. He called the fanatics filling his stands \"fans\".<ref>{{cite book|author= Suehsdorf |title=The Great American Baseball Scrapbook |year=1978 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-394-50253-1}}</ref>\n\n''Supporter'' is a synonym to \"fan\" that predates the latter term and is still commonly used in [[British English]], especially to denote fans of [[sport]]s teams. However, the term \"fan\" has become popular throughout the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, including the [[United Kingdom]]. The term ''supporter'' is also used in a [[political]] sense in the [[United States]], to a fan of a [[politician]], a [[political party]], and a controversial issue.\n\n{{fact span|text=There are accounts of the word \"fan\" not coming from the word \"fanatic.\"  In the very early days of baseball and up until even the 1960s,  it was proper for men to wear a coat, hat and tie while the women often wore a dress oftentimes with a hat. In the dog days of summer, the heat from wearing such clothes could become unbearable.  Spectators would fan themselves so much with their programs, scorecards or actual hand fans so often players couldn't see their faces.  The players would speak amongst themselves with phrases like, \"sure are a lot of fans out there today\" or if there's a bad call or a very exciting play or dramatic moment in a game, it could be common to hear a player say, \"lotta noise coming from the fans today.\"|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nFans usually have a strong enough interest that some changes in their [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] are made to accommodate devotion to the focal object. Fans have a desire for external involvement \u2013 they are motivated to demonstrate their involvement with the area of interest through certain behaviors (attending [[Fan convention|conventions]], posting online, displaying team banners outside their homes, etc.). Fans often have a \"wish to acquire\" material objects related to the area of interest, such as a baseball hit by a famous slugger or a used [[guitar pick]] from their musical hero. As well, some fans have a desire for [[social interaction]] with other fans. This again may take many forms, from casual conversation, e-mail, chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists to regular face-to-face meetings such as fan club meetings and organized conventions.\n\nThere are several groups of fans that can be differentiated by the intensity level of their level of involvement or interest in the hobby (level of [[fanaticism]])<ref name=TB>{{cite journal | last = Thorne | first = Scott |author2=Bruner, Gordon C. | year = 2006 | title = An exploratory investigation of the characteristics of consumer fanaticism | journal = Qualitative Market Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201372 | doi = 10.1108/13522750610640558 | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/2160090104.html }}</ref> The likelihood for a subject of interest to be elevated to the level of fandom appears to be dictated by its complexity. Complexity allows further involvement of fans for a longer period of time because of the time needed to work the subject of interest 'out.' It also contributes to a greater sense of belonging because of the mental effort invested in the subject.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Fan culture==\n{{Main|Fandom|Fanzine|Fan magazine}}\n\n==Types==\n===Celebrities===\n[[File:Tobey Maguire greets fans at Spiderman 3 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[Tobey Maguire]] greets fans at ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' premiere]]\nThese fans will often hold a crush on a major [[movie star]], [[pop music|pop star]], [[athlete]] or [[celebrity]] (see [[teen idol]]). The [[groupie]] is an example, a fan of a particular band or musician, who will follow them on concert tours. The degree of devotion to celebrities can range from a simple crush to the [[delusion|deluded]] belief that they have a special relationship with the star which does not exist. In extreme cases, this can lead to [[celebrity worship syndrome]], [[stalking]] behavior. This can easily switch to [[hatred]] of the previously loved celebrity, and result in attempts at violent attacks, one notable incident being the death of [[Rebecca Schaeffer]] by a stalking fan in 1989.\n\nThis is somewhat related to the concept of [[parasocial interaction]] where audiences develop one-sided relationships with media characters and celebrities.\n\nNot all the fans have a crush on their idols. There's also fans who want to become their friends or respect an idol's relationship. In fact, there are fans who idolize their celebrity couples.\n\n===Gaming===\n{{details|Gamers}}\nGaming fans, or \"gamers\", are fans focused on playing non-sport games, usually [[role-playing game]]s, [[board game]]s, [[miniature wargame]]s, [[collectible card game]]s or [[video game]]s.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Music fan.jpg|thumb|A [[cowboy pop]] fan shows off a rare CD at a [[music festival]]]]\nMusic fans can differ somewhat from fans of particular musicians, in that they may focus on a genre of music. Many of the trade journals around music, such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', were created by music fans. A notable music fan was groupie [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]], famous for making numerous plaster casts of rock stars' penises.  Another was [[Pamela Des Barres]], author of the book ''[[I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie|I'm With The Band]]''.  Fans who are not [[groupie]]s prefer the term ''supporter''. In the 1960s, the extreme frenzy of music fans surrounding [[The Beatles]] became known as [[Beatlemania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/05/1964-beatlemania/100745/|title=1964: Beatlemania - The Atlantic|last=Taylor|first=Alan|website=www.theatlantic.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> In 2019, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' observed that popular musicians such as [[Tyler, the Creator]] had leveraged the power of fans to drive digital downloads using merchandise bundles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533363/mondo-nyc-what-influences-charts-panelists-recap|title=Merch Bundles, Memes & More: Mondo.NYC Conference Discusses What's Influencing Music Charts|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Similarly, ''[[GQ]]'' recognized [[Vampire Weekend]] for their commitment to extensive band merchandising for dedicated fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/vampire-weekend-merch|title=The Very Deep Merch Galaxy of Vampire Weekend|last=Nast|first=Cond\u00e9|website=GQ|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n====Musicals====\nPopular [[musical theatre|musicals]] have their own particular sets of fans.

In Japan, the term is normally derogatory, a connotation lacking in English, where it generally refers to people in the [[anime and manga fandom]].\n\n===Politics===\nPeople who approve of or associate themselves with certain [[politician]]s or political groups are generally called \"supporters\" rather than \"fans\", although there are politicians with official or unofficial \"fan clubs\".  Intense and organized support for a politician may be referred to as a [[personality cult]], particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\n\n===Professional wrestling===\n\nFans of [[professional wrestling]] can be divided into two groups: [[Mark (professional wrestling)|marks]] and [[Smark (professional wrestling)|smarks]]. Derived from the same term for the prey of [[Confidence trick|conmen]], a mark is a fan who believes that everything associated with professional wrestling is real. In contrast, a \"smark\" is a fan who recognizes that they are witnessing a stage-managed work (\"[[kayfabe]]\"), but appreciates it nonetheless, including its backstage aspects.\n\n===Science fiction===\n{{Details|Science fiction fandom}}\n[[File:Star Trek cosplayers in Dragon Con Parade 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=People wearing Star Trek: the Next Gneration uniforms in a parade.|''[[Star Trek]]'' fans cosplaying at Atlanta Dragon Con 2010.]]\n\nSince the 1920s, an increasingly elaborate sub-culture of organized [[science fiction fandom]] has arisen, initially among correspondents to the [[letter column]]s of [[science fiction magazine]]s. This non-centralized movement has given birth to [[science fiction fanzines]] (and [[amateur press associations]]), [[science fiction conventions]], the [[Hugo Awards]] (and various imitators/derivatives), [[filk music]], \"fan funds\" such as the [[Trans Atlantic Fan Fund]], and a variety of other institutions, jargon and customs. It has nurtured writers and artists such as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Roger Ebert]], [[Lenny Kaye]], [[Michael Moorcock]] and [[Trina Robbins]]; and has generated such spin-offs as comic book fandom, [[media fandom]], the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[game|gaming]] fandom, and [[furry fandom]], sometimes collectively referred to as \"fringe fandoms\".\n\nScience fiction fandom developed its own slang, known as [[fanspeak]] after the \"Newspeak\" of the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]''.  Fanspeak is made up of [[acronym]]s, blended words, obscure in-jokes, [[pun]]s, coinages from science fiction novels or films, and archaic or standard English words used in specific ways relevant or amusing to the science fiction community.  Some fanspeak terms, like [[fanzine]] have become standard English.  Some fanspeak terms relate to fans themselves:\n* An [[wikt:actifan|Actifan]] is a fan involved in \"[[wikt:fanac|fanac]]\" (fan activity), such as producing a fanzine or running a convention.  The opposite is a [[wikt:passifan|Passifan]], who enjoys the subject of the fandom and is not directly involved in the fandom.\n* A [[Big Name Fan]] (BNF) is a fan who has become well-known within a fandom for their contributions of various sorts, such as heading of a major blog or contributing to the franchise itself.\n* [[wikt:fanne|Fanne]] was used in early fandom as a feminine equivalent to \"fan\".\n* [[wikt:fen#Etymology 2|Fen]] was used within fandom as the plural of the word \"fan\", by analogy with \"men\" as the plural of \"man\".  This extended to other fanspeak terms, resulting in actifen, passifen, trufen, and so forth.\n* A [[wikt:trufan|Trufan]] is a very active and dedicated fan.\n\nSpecific sub-groups of science fiction fandom are often known by a collection term.  For example:\n* [[Trekkie]]s are fans focused on the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[science fiction]] franchise. Arising out of [[science fiction fandom]] they, to some extent, have served as a template for other organized fandoms in the [[science fiction television]] and [[science fiction film|film]] genres.  Some \"Trekkies\" prefer to be referred to as \"Trekkers\" as they feel the term \"Trekkies\" was used in the past as a derogatory name for them and they hope to avoid the traditional stigma sometimes associated with being known as a \"Trekkie\".  Many \"old school\" fans of the ''Star Trek'' universe defiantly, and proudly, refer to themselves, and other ''Star Trek'' fans, as \"Trekkies\" rather than the kinder, gentler \"Trekkers\" name used by many of the newer generations of ''Star Trek'' fans.\n* [[Whovians]] are fans of the longest running science fiction television show in the world, [[Doctor Who]].\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Fenerbah\u00e7e SK fans.jpg|thumb|[[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.]] club fan mother with child and pet]]\n{{see also|Sociology of sport|:Category:Sports fandom}}\n{{see also|Sports radio}}\nA sports fan can be an enthusiast for a particular athlete, team, sport, or all of organized sports as a whole.

At a stadium or arena, sports fans will voice their pleasure with a particular incident, player, or team by [[cheering]], which consists of clapping, fist-pumping, or shouting positive exclamations toward the field of play and ultimately, the favorable object. Likewise, displeasure toward a particular incident, player, or team may be met by fans with booing, shouting of expletives, and sometimes throwing of objects onto the field. This violent type of fan reaction is often called [[hooliganism]].\n\n[[File:Shea Crowded.jpg|thumb|left|Shea Stadium filled with fans prior to the start of a [[New York Mets]] game in 2008. The stadium had the best attendance in the [[National League]] that year, garnering over 53,000 fans per game on average.]]\n\nLighter, more harmless objects are also occasionally thrown onto certain fields of play as a form of celebration of a favorable sports feat. This is most common when a member of the home team scores a [[hat trick]] in hockey. Other, more mild forms of displeasure shown by sports fans at sporting events involve simple groans of disappointment, and silence. These actions often denote that the favored home team is being outperformed by, or has lost to the much less-favored road team.\n\nIn North America, extremely enthusiastic fans are often called  \"superfans\": fans who dress up in outrageous and ostentatious costumes or outfits showing their devotion. Fanbases well known for their tenacious love and undying support are called ''[[Rabies|rabid]] fans'' or fanatics. These fans often congregate hours before kickoff in what is known as a [[tailgation]] or tailgating.\n\nAt [[Bar (establishment)|sports bars]], sports fans will gather together, often while consuming food and alcoholic beverages, with the purpose of following a particular sporting event on television as a group. Sports bars often advertise in hopes of drawing fans of a particular player or team to watch together to increase bonds between fans and prevent fights. This can create the sense of unity in a sports bar as all cheers and boos will appear to be synchronized due to similar feelings and reactions by nearly all fans at the fortunes and misfortunes of the favored team or athlete. Due to the level of devotion and intensity of feeling towards the favored team or athlete by sports bar patrons, as well as partially due to the alcohol being served, behavior that would be seen as unruly or fanatical outside a sports bar is generally more common inside of one. The intensity of cheering and jeering at a sports bar by sports fans can often range from equal to stronger than that of fans actually at the sporting event for particularly significant games and matches.\n\nAt home, sports fans may have few fellow fans but also more freedom. This is sometimes where the most intense cheering or jeering will take place. In the fan's own home, unbridled and lengthy screaming, crying, acts of destruction to household objects, and other manifestations of joy or anguish, are perhaps seen as most acceptable in comparison to the sports bar or sporting venue simply because such acts taken to such an extreme can be seen as disruptive to a large number of fellow fans even if they share the same sentiment if it is of less intensity. The greatest variables of the reaction of a sports fan in their own home are the intensity of the fan's desire to see their team win or perform well, and the presence of another: often a wife, children, or friends who may be significantly less ardent sports fans or not sports fans at all, which may significantly temper the fan's reaction to a highly positive or negative moment due to the fear of causing a scene or scaring those close to the fan, or alienating themselves from said others. Often sports fans will invite other fans of relatively similar rooting intensity over to their house to experience a sporting event together so that all involved can voice pleasure or displeasure to their heart's content and increase [[male bonding|shared bonds]] in the process. It is becoming common for this type of bonding to take place over sports-related [[social networks]].\n\n==Fan psychology and motives==\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Fan de hockey 01.jpg|thumbnail|Representation of a hockey fan]]\nThe drivers that make people fans, and in particular sports fans, have been studied by psychologists, such as Dan Wann at [[Murray State University]],<ref name=\"wann\">{{cite book |last=Wann |first=Daniel L. |title=Sport Fans: The Psychology and Social Impact of Spectators |publisher=Routledge |date=January 10, 2001 |isbn=978-0415924641}}</ref> and communication scholars, such as [[Adam Earnheardt]] at [[Youngstown State University]].<ref name=\"earnheardt1\">{{cite book |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |authorlink1=Adam Earnheardt |title=Judging Athlete Behaviors: Exploring Possible Predictors of Television Viewer Judgments of Athlete Antisocial Behaviors |publisher=AV Akademikerverlag |date=June 28, 2012 |isbn=978-3639433456}}</ref><ref name=\"earnheardt2\">{{cite book |editor-last1=Earnheardt |editor-first1=Adam C. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Hugenberg |editor-first3=Barbara |title=Sports Fans, Identity, and Socialization: Exploring the Fandemonium |publisher=Lexington Books |date=May 30, 2013 |isbn=978-0739146217}}</ref>\n\nThey attribute people becoming fans to the following factors:<ref name=Conrad>{{cite book|title=The Business of Sports: A Primer for Journalists|author=Mark Conrad|chapter=What Makes Sports a Unique Business?|pages=[https://archive.org/details/businessofsports0000conr/page/ xxx\u2013xxxi]|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-5044-9|nopp=true|url=https://archive.org/details/businessofsports0000conr/page/}}</ref> One element is entertainment, because sports spectatorship is a form of leisure. Sports is also a form of escapism, and being a fan gives one an excuse to yell at something, an activity that may be constrained in other areas of one's life. Fan activities give participants a combination of euphoria and stress (about the potential for their team to lose) for which they coin the name \"eustress\". Fans experience euphoria during moments when play is going well for their team, and stress when play is going against their team. This tension between the two emotions generates an unusual sense of pleasure or heightened sensations.<ref name=\"motives\">{{cite book |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |editor-last1=Hugenberg |editor-first1=Lawrence W. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Earnheardt |editor-first3=Adam C. |title=Sports Mania: Essays on Fandom and the Media in the 21st Century |publisher=MacFarland |date=July 16, 2008 |pages=158\u2013171 |chapter=Exploring Motives and Fandom for Viewing Televised Sports |isbn=978-0786437269}}</ref>\n\nAesthetics are another draw for some fans, who appreciate the precision or skill of play, or of the coordinated movement of the players during a pre-planned \"play\".<ref name=\"motives\" /> Family bonding is a reason for some fan activities. Some families watch televised sports on a regular basis and go to sports games as a family outing to watch events and form a [[human bonding|psychological bond]] with one another and as a family. Going to sports events can create a borrowed sense of self-esteem if fans identify with their teams to the extent that they consider themselves to be successful when their teams have been successful (e.g., as seen in the phrase \"we have won\").<ref name=\"motives\" /> If a fan identifies strongly with a favorite team, they will respond to the performance of the team as if team success were a personal success and team failure a personal failure.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lynn R.

The term '''[[nerd]]''', defined as \"[an] insignificant, foolish, or socially inept person; a person who is boringly conventional or studious; a person who pursues an unfashionable or highly technical interest with obsessive or exclusive dedication,\"<ref>\"nerd, n.\" ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2014.</ref> as well as the term '''[[geek]]''', defined as \"[a] person [\u2026] who is regarded as foolish, offensive, worthless; an overly diligent, unsociable student; any unsociable person obsessively devoted to a particular pursuit,\"<ref>\"geek, n.\" ''OED Online''.

In regards to chosen fandoms, they are typically associated with comic books, video games, science fiction movies or television series, or technology (such as computer or smartphone brands).<ref name=\"verge\" />\n\nAn exception to this portrayal is the sports fan, who is expected to be overtly sexual, and aggressive.<ref name=\"sports\">Gosling, Victoria K. \"Girls Allowed? The Marginalization of Female Sports Fans.\" Eds. Gray, Jonathan, et al. ''Fandom: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World.'' New York: New York University Press, 2007.

They need to have this exaggerated sense of their sexuality to defend themselves from potential accusations that they are not real men.\"<ref>Coddington, A. ''One of the Lads: Women who Follow Football.'' London: Harper Collins, 1997. Print.</ref>\n\n====Societal gender roles====\n\nAccording to [[Jackson Katz]] in the documentary ''Tough Guise 2'', boys are taught early on that to be \"real men\" they need to be tough and not to show their feelings.<ref name=\"TG2\">''Tough Guise 2.'' Writ./Dir. Jackson Katz and Jeremy Earp. Media Education Foundation Production, 2013.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[Men] can't show any emotion except anger. We can't think too much or seem too intellectual. We can't back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we're tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We're supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we're taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay.<ref name=\"TG2\" /></blockquote>\n\nHe later elaborates, stating that, \n<blockquote>Qualities like compassion, caring, empathy, intellectual curiosity, fear, vulnerability, even love \u2013 basic human qualities that boys have inside them every bit as much as girls do \u2013 get methodically driven out of them by a sexist and homophobic culture that labels these things as 'unmanly,' 'feminine,' 'womanly,' and 'gay,' and teaches boys to avoid them at all costs.\n\nAnd, most importantly, they're taught that real men turn to violence not as a last resort, but as the go-to method of resolving disputes \u2013 and also as a primary means of winning respect and establishing masculine credibility.<ref name=\"TG2\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn the predecessor to this documentary, ''Tough Guise'', Katz also addresses the issue of body image, using multiple movies, such as ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', as well as action figures like [[G.I. Joe]], to illustrate how 'real men' are defined as big, strong, and muscular.<ref>''Tough Guise.'' Writ. Jackson Katz. Dir. Sut Jhally. Media Education Foundation \nProduction, 1999.</ref>\n\nFanboy portrayals, by definition, do not fit into this mold of a 'real man', with the exception of sports fans. In a study by Gerard Jones on comic book fans, he described the comic book fanboys as \"small, anxious, withdrawn, and terrified of the opposite sex.\"<ref>Jones, Gerard. Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book. New York: Basic Books, 2004.</ref> Quite the opposite of the 'real man' previously described by Katz. Their interests may also be considered as a deviation from societal gender roles, according to Noah Berlastsky, such as playing ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' instead of football.<ref name=\"bully\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-geeks-get-bullied-its-not-necessarily-for-being-geeks/272723/2/ |title=Why Geeks Get Bullied (It's Not Necessarily for Being Geeks) |magazine=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>  This lack of traditional masculine traits warrants them much teasing from peers, parental figures, coaches, or older male role models for not conforming to these ideas of masculinity.<ref name=\"TG2\" /><ref name=\"bully\" /><ref>Pustz, Matthew. ''Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers.'' Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1999.</ref> A popular example of such treatment in mainstream media is shown on the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', where, multiple times throughout the show's run, the four main characters, portrayed as 'nerdy fanboys', are humiliated by larger 'real men'. For instance, in the show pilot, the two main characters, Leonard and Sheldon, get their pants taken by the main female character's ex-boyfriend, who is portrayed as big, strong, tough, confident, and successful with women.<ref>\"Pilot.\" ''The Big Bang Theory.''

For example, [[Bronies]], a group of young men enthralled by the TV show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', a show typically geared towards young girls, are often the target of ridicule. Their interest in a 'feminine' media item can be the cause of great shame, causing many to become 'private' bronies, enjoying the show in secret out of fear.<ref name=\"bronies\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV0lDp3I58I |title=BABScon 2014 - Bronies; An Analysis of Fandom and Gender |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\n{{see also|Crowd abuse|:Category:Association football hooliganism}}\nFanboys are often portrayed as quite angry, violent, and offensive while defending the objects of their affection, such as the smartphone fanboys who frequently verbally attack anybody saying anything the slightest bit offensive about their chosen technological product through online anonymous sites.<ref name=\"verge\" /> In fact, the term 'fanboy' is often used as an insult towards other fans, deemed unreasonable, arrogant, or overly loyal to their chosen token of affection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSuch defensiveness is particularly prominent against women who are interested in their chosen fandoms or who pose a \"threat\" to their community.

New York: 1971. 141-7.</ref> implying that women's involvement in fan communities is purely sexual, and that they are incapable of displaying intellectual or artistic interest in the music itself.<ref name=\"music\" /> Those who do manage to become involved within the world of 'serious' music are often relegated to the realm of a 'groupie'.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> A groupie, according to Cheryl Cline, is\n\n<blockquote>[A] person (a woman, usually), who 'chases after' rock stars, as my mother would say. But 'groupie' is also used more or less synonymously with 'girl Rock fan', 'female journalist', and 'woman Rock musician'; it's used to mean anyone working in the music field who isn't actually a Rock musician; it's used as an all-purpose insult and a slut on one's professionalism; it's used as a cute term for 'hero worship'; and it's used interchangeably with 'fan'.<ref name=\"groupies\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn other words, the term 'groupie' (used synonymously with the term 'fan' or 'fangirl') is frequently used to shame women involved within the music community, restricting their involvement to sexual relations with band members or worshipping male rock stars.<ref name=\"groupies\" />\n\nThis trend can also be observed within other fan communities, such as comic book fandoms, where women are frequently portrayed as \"Fake Geek Girls\", only interested in comic books to impress guys or to view the attractive men present within their content,<ref name=\"geek\" /><ref>{{cite news|author=Gavia Baker-Whitelaw |url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/fake-geek-girls-geek-guys-buzzfeed/ |title=The absurdity of this 'fake geek guys' video makes a powerful point |work=The Daily Dot |date=2014-08-27 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref> or sports communities, where women are often made uncomfortable at live sporting events due to the overt sexism and aggressive masculinity displayed by male spectators, and then labelled as 'inauthentic' for viewing the games via television instead.<ref name=\"sports\" /> Within hockey, female fans are often called \"Puck Bunnies\", defined as,\n\n<blockquote>[S]omeone who hangs around the players, always on the lookout for the chance to get that autograph / photograph / quick pint [drink] / quick knee trem-bler round the back of the Arena from the player or players (or even coach) of their choice, heck let's face it even the water carrier is in with a chance here.<ref name=\"hockey\" /></blockquote>\n\nSuch discrimination against female fans can become violent at times in an effort to police \"authenticity\".<ref name=\"fridge\" /> The recent events known as [[GamerGate]] provide a good example of such attacks, whereby multiple women working within the gaming industry were victims of sexual harassment and violent threats, some even forced to leave their homes for fear of a physical confrontation.<ref name=\"anita\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29821050 |title=Zoe Quinn: GamerGate must be condemned - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Frase|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/in-defense-of-gamers/ |title=In Defense of Gamers |publisher=Jacobin |date=2014-10-04 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>\n\n====Conduct and age====\n\nIn terms of their involvement within fandoms, fangirls are typically portrayed as losing all control, fainting, sobbing, and dashing about in mobs.<ref name=\"beatles\">Ehrenreich, Barbara, Elizabeth Hess, and Gloria Jacobs. \"Beatlemania: Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" Ed. Lewis, Lisa A. ''The Adoring Audience: Fan Culture and Popular Media.'' New York; London: Routledge, 1992. Print. 84-106.</ref> For instance, while describing the phenomenon of Beatlemania, fan activity is described by stating that: \n<blockquote>The appropriate reaction to contact with [the Beatles] \u2013 such as occupying the same auditorium or city block \u2013 was to sob uncontrollably while screaming, 'I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die,' or, more optimistically, the name of a favorite Beatle, until the onset of either unconsciousness or laryngitis. Girls peed in their pants, fainted, or simply collapsed from the emotional strain.<ref name=\"beatles\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe fangirls' so-called 'hysteria' is described as the product of sexual repression.<ref name=\"beatles\" /> However, while it is expected for women to be involved in certain fandoms for physical or sexual reasons, this is also viewed as undesirable and driven by hormonal changes.\n\nThese acts of adoration are societally limited to adolescent youth, or menopausal women, in both instances blaming \"these two periods of hormonal lunacy\" on the irrational, overtly sexual behaviour.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> For instance, Cheryl Cline, in her text entitled \"Essays from Bitch: The Women's Rock Newsletter with Bite\", discusses how women need to keep their interests hidden once they pass adolescence.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> In her own words, \"[i]t's a sign of maturity to pack up all the posters, photos, magazines, scrapbooks, and unauthorized biographies you so lovingly collected and shove them in the back of the closet.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> Furthermore, while discussing Beatlemania and the crazed Beatles fangirl behaviour, Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Heiss, and Gloria Jacobs mention how the 'only cure' for what was at the time considered an affliction was age, and that similarly to \"the girls who had screamed for Frank Sinatra,\" the Beatles fangirls would \"[grow] up to be responsible, settled housewives.\"<ref name=\"beatles\" />\n\nThese conflicting accounts of fangirl behaviour are due to the belief that women are not supposed to express such sexual fantasies unless influenced by some hormonal induced craziness, while for men it is normal to be sexual regardless of age.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> As Cheryl Cline summarizes, \n<blockquote>It's much easier for a man to be indulgent about the crushes of teenage girls than it is for him to be fair-minded about the sexual fantasies of the woman he loves when they're about someone else. And the same guy who'll leave ''Penthouse'' in the bathroom will yell, 'No woman of mine is gonna hang a poster of Prince naked to the waist on the inside of the closet of the spare room where no one will see it!' [\u2026] [U]ntil you reach the age when everybody thinks you're crazy anyway, so why not admit to an intense hankering to run your fingers through Willie Nelson's whiskers?<ref name=\"groupies\" /></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fan art]]\n* [[Fan club]]\n* [[Fansite]]\n* [[Fan activism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Daniel L.

Collectively, the fans of a particular object or person constitute its fanbase or [[fandom]]. They may show their [[enthusiasm]] in a variety of ways, such as by promoting the object of their interest, being members of a [[fan club]], holding or participating in [[fan convention]]s, or writing [[fan mail]]. They may also engage in creative activities (\"[[fan labor]]\") such as creating [[fanzine]]s, writing [[fan fiction]], making memes or drawing [[fan art]].\n\n==Etymology==\nMerriam-Webster, the Oxford dictionary and other sources define \"fan\" as a shortened version of the word ''fanatic''.  ''[[Fanaticism|Fanatic]]'' itself, introduced into English around 1550, means \"marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion\". It comes from the Modern [[Latin (language)|Latin]] ''fanaticus'', meaning \"insanely but divinely inspired\". The word originally pertained to a [[temple]] or sacred place [Latin ''fanum'', poetic English ''fane'']. The modern sense of \"extremely zealous\" dates from around 1647; the use of ''fanatic'' as a noun dates from 1650. However, the term \"fancy\" for an intense liking of something (a usage attested by 1545<ref>{{cite web|title=\"fancy, v.\" OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68026|date=July 2018|url-access=subscription|accessdate=2018-10-16}}</ref>), while being of a different etymology, coincidentally carries a less intense but somewhat similar connotation to \"fanatic\". Use of \"the fancy\" to mean avid sports enthusiasts emerged as an [[American English|Americanism]] in the mid-19th C.<ref name=\"BBCblog\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-34298659 |title=The Vocabularist: Are fans fanatical or fanciful? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref> ''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'' cites William Henry Nugent's work asserting that it was derived from ''the fancy'', a term referring to the fans of a specific hobby or sport from the early 18th century to the 19th, especially to the followers of [[boxing]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fan&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Fan (n.2)|author=Douglas Harper |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> According to that theory, it was originally shortened to ''fance'' then just to the homonym ''fans''.{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} ''The Great American Baseball Scrapbook'' attributes the term to [[Chris Von der Ahe]], owner of the Saint Louis Brown Stockings in 1882. Von der Ahe sold tickets for 25 cents, hoping the many patrons would purchase his beer; the low ticket price helped him lead the stats in attendance. He called the fanatics filling his stands \"fans\".<ref>{{cite book|author= Suehsdorf |title=The Great American Baseball Scrapbook |year=1978 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-394-50253-1}}</ref>\n\n''Supporter'' is a synonym to \"fan\" that predates the latter term and is still commonly used in [[British English]], especially to denote fans of [[sport]]s teams. However, the term \"fan\" has become popular throughout the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, including the [[United Kingdom]]. The term ''supporter'' is also used in a [[political]] sense in the [[United States]], to a fan of a [[politician]], a [[political party]], and a controversial issue.\n\n{{fact span|text=There are accounts of the word \"fan\" not coming from the word \"fanatic.\"  In the very early days of baseball and up until even the 1960s,  it was proper for men to wear a coat, hat and tie while the women often wore a dress oftentimes with a hat. In the dog days of summer, the heat from wearing such clothes could become unbearable.  Spectators would fan themselves so much with their programs, scorecards or actual hand fans so often players couldn't see their faces.  The players would speak amongst themselves with phrases like, \"sure are a lot of fans out there today\" or if there's a bad call or a very exciting play or dramatic moment in a game, it could be common to hear a player say, \"lotta noise coming from the fans today.\"|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nFans usually have a strong enough interest that some changes in their [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] are made to accommodate devotion to the focal object. Fans have a desire for external involvement \u2013 they are motivated to demonstrate their involvement with the area of interest through certain behaviors (attending [[Fan convention|conventions]], posting online, displaying team banners outside their homes, etc.). Fans often have a \"wish to acquire\" material objects related to the area of interest, such as a baseball hit by a famous slugger or a used [[guitar pick]] from their musical hero. As well, some fans have a desire for [[social interaction]] with other fans. This again may take many forms, from casual conversation, e-mail, chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists to regular face-to-face meetings such as fan club meetings and organized conventions.\n\nThere are several groups of fans that can be differentiated by the intensity level of their level of involvement or interest in the hobby (level of [[fanaticism]])<ref name=TB>{{cite journal | last = Thorne | first = Scott |author2=Bruner, Gordon C. | year = 2006 | title = An exploratory investigation of the characteristics of consumer fanaticism | journal = Qualitative Market Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201372 | doi = 10.1108/13522750610640558 | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/2160090104.html }}</ref> The likelihood for a subject of interest to be elevated to the level of fandom appears to be dictated by its complexity. Complexity allows further involvement of fans for a longer period of time because of the time needed to work the subject of interest 'out.' It also contributes to a greater sense of belonging because of the mental effort invested in the subject.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Fan culture==\n{{Main|Fandom|Fanzine|Fan magazine}}\n\n==Types==\n===Celebrities===\n[[File:Tobey Maguire greets fans at Spiderman 3 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[Tobey Maguire]] greets fans at ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' premiere]]\nThese fans will often hold a crush on a major [[movie star]], [[pop music|pop star]], [[athlete]] or [[celebrity]] (see [[teen idol]]). The [[groupie]] is an example, a fan of a particular band or musician, who will follow them on concert tours. The degree of devotion to celebrities can range from a simple crush to the [[delusion|deluded]] belief that they have a special relationship with the star which does not exist. In extreme cases, this can lead to [[celebrity worship syndrome]], [[stalking]] behavior. This can easily switch to [[hatred]] of the previously loved celebrity, and result in attempts at violent attacks, one notable incident being the death of [[Rebecca Schaeffer]] by a stalking fan in 1989.\n\nThis is somewhat related to the concept of [[parasocial interaction]] where audiences develop one-sided relationships with media characters and celebrities.\n\nNot all the fans have a crush on their idols. There's also fans who want to become their friends or respect an idol's relationship. In fact, there are fans who idolize their celebrity couples.\n\n===Gaming===\n{{details|Gamers}}\nGaming fans, or \"gamers\", are fans focused on playing non-sport games, usually [[role-playing game]]s, [[board game]]s, [[miniature wargame]]s, [[collectible card game]]s or [[video game]]s.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Music fan.jpg|thumb|A [[cowboy pop]] fan shows off a rare CD at a [[music festival]]]]\nMusic fans can differ somewhat from fans of particular musicians, in that they may focus on a genre of music. Many of the trade journals around music, such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', were created by music fans. A notable music fan was groupie [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]], famous for making numerous plaster casts of rock stars' penises.  Another was [[Pamela Des Barres]], author of the book ''[[I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie|I'm With The Band]]''.  Fans who are not [[groupie]]s prefer the term ''supporter''. In the 1960s, the extreme frenzy of music fans surrounding [[The Beatles]] became known as [[Beatlemania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/05/1964-beatlemania/100745/|title=1964: Beatlemania - The Atlantic|last=Taylor|first=Alan|website=www.theatlantic.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> In 2019, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' observed that popular musicians such as [[Tyler, the Creator]] had leveraged the power of fans to drive digital downloads using merchandise bundles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533363/mondo-nyc-what-influences-charts-panelists-recap|title=Merch Bundles, Memes & More: Mondo.NYC Conference Discusses What's Influencing Music Charts|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Similarly, ''[[GQ]]'' recognized [[Vampire Weekend]] for their commitment to extensive band merchandising for dedicated fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/vampire-weekend-merch|title=The Very Deep Merch Galaxy of Vampire Weekend|last=Nast|first=Cond\u00e9|website=GQ|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n====Musicals====\nPopular [[musical theatre|musicals]] have their own particular sets of fans.

In Japan, the term is normally derogatory, a connotation lacking in English, where it generally refers to people in the [[anime and manga fandom]].\n\n===Politics===\nPeople who approve of or associate themselves with certain [[politician]]s or political groups are generally called \"supporters\" rather than \"fans\", although there are politicians with official or unofficial \"fan clubs\".  Intense and organized support for a politician may be referred to as a [[personality cult]], particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\n\n===Professional wrestling===\n\nFans of [[professional wrestling]] can be divided into two groups: [[Mark (professional wrestling)|marks]] and [[Smark (professional wrestling)|smarks]]. Derived from the same term for the prey of [[Confidence trick|conmen]], a mark is a fan who believes that everything associated with professional wrestling is real. In contrast, a \"smark\" is a fan who recognizes that they are witnessing a stage-managed work (\"[[kayfabe]]\"), but appreciates it nonetheless, including its backstage aspects.\n\n===Science fiction===\n{{Details|Science fiction fandom}}\n[[File:Star Trek cosplayers in Dragon Con Parade 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=People wearing Star Trek: the Next Gneration uniforms in a parade.|''[[Star Trek]]'' fans cosplaying at Atlanta Dragon Con 2010.]]\n\nSince the 1920s, an increasingly elaborate sub-culture of organized [[science fiction fandom]] has arisen, initially among correspondents to the [[letter column]]s of [[science fiction magazine]]s. This non-centralized movement has given birth to [[science fiction fanzines]] (and [[amateur press associations]]), [[science fiction conventions]], the [[Hugo Awards]] (and various imitators/derivatives), [[filk music]], \"fan funds\" such as the [[Trans Atlantic Fan Fund]], and a variety of other institutions, jargon and customs. It has nurtured writers and artists such as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Roger Ebert]], [[Lenny Kaye]], [[Michael Moorcock]] and [[Trina Robbins]]; and has generated such spin-offs as comic book fandom, [[media fandom]], the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[game|gaming]] fandom, and [[furry fandom]], sometimes collectively referred to as \"fringe fandoms\".\n\nScience fiction fandom developed its own slang, known as [[fanspeak]] after the \"Newspeak\" of the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]''.  Fanspeak is made up of [[acronym]]s, blended words, obscure in-jokes, [[pun]]s, coinages from science fiction novels or films, and archaic or standard English words used in specific ways relevant or amusing to the science fiction community.  Some fanspeak terms, like [[fanzine]] have become standard English.  Some fanspeak terms relate to fans themselves:\n* An [[wikt:actifan|Actifan]] is a fan involved in \"[[wikt:fanac|fanac]]\" (fan activity), such as producing a fanzine or running a convention.  The opposite is a [[wikt:passifan|Passifan]], who enjoys the subject of the fandom and is not directly involved in the fandom.\n* A [[Big Name Fan]] (BNF) is a fan who has become well-known within a fandom for their contributions of various sorts, such as heading of a major blog or contributing to the franchise itself.\n* [[wikt:fanne|Fanne]] was used in early fandom as a feminine equivalent to \"fan\".\n* [[wikt:fen#Etymology 2|Fen]] was used within fandom as the plural of the word \"fan\", by analogy with \"men\" as the plural of \"man\".  This extended to other fanspeak terms, resulting in actifen, passifen, trufen, and so forth.\n* A [[wikt:trufan|Trufan]] is a very active and dedicated fan.\n\nSpecific sub-groups of science fiction fandom are often known by a collection term.  For example:\n* [[Trekkie]]s are fans focused on the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[science fiction]] franchise. Arising out of [[science fiction fandom]] they, to some extent, have served as a template for other organized fandoms in the [[science fiction television]] and [[science fiction film|film]] genres.  Some \"Trekkies\" prefer to be referred to as \"Trekkers\" as they feel the term \"Trekkies\" was used in the past as a derogatory name for them and they hope to avoid the traditional stigma sometimes associated with being known as a \"Trekkie\".  Many \"old school\" fans of the ''Star Trek'' universe defiantly, and proudly, refer to themselves, and other ''Star Trek'' fans, as \"Trekkies\" rather than the kinder, gentler \"Trekkers\" name used by many of the newer generations of ''Star Trek'' fans.\n* [[Whovians]] are fans of the longest running science fiction television show in the world, [[Doctor Who]].\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Fenerbah\u00e7e SK fans.jpg|thumb|[[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.]] club fan mother with child and pet]]\n{{see also|Sociology of sport|:Category:Sports fandom}}\n{{see also|Sports radio}}\nA sports fan can be an enthusiast for a particular athlete, team, sport, or all of organized sports as a whole. Sports fans often attend sporting events in [[stadiums]], in [[sports bars]], or watch them at home on television, and follow news through newspapers,  websites, and social media.<ref name=\"understanding\">{{cite book |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |editor-last1=Earnheardt |editor-first1=Adam C. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Hugenberg |editor-first3=Barbara |title=Sports Fans, Identity, and Socialization: Exploring the Fandemonium  |publisher=Lexington Books |date=May 30, 2013 |pages=1\u20136 |chapter=Understanding Fans' Consumption and Dissemination of Sports: An Introduction |isbn=978-0739146217}}</ref>\n\nThe mentality of the sports fan is often such that they will experience a game, or event while living vicariously through players or teams whom the fan favors.<ref name=\"fandom1\">{{cite journal |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |date=October 1, 2009 |title=An examination of fan-athlete interaction: Fandom, parasocial interaction, and identification |url=http://digitalcommons.kent.edu/commpubs/2 |journal=Ohio Communication Journal |volume=47 |pages=27\u201353}}</ref> This behavior manifests itself in a number of different ways, depending on the venue. At a stadium or arena, sports fans will voice their pleasure with a particular incident, player, or team by [[cheering]], which consists of clapping, fist-pumping, or shouting positive exclamations toward the field of play and ultimately, the favorable object. Likewise, displeasure toward a particular incident, player, or team may be met by fans with booing, shouting of expletives, and sometimes throwing of objects onto the field. This violent type of fan reaction is often called [[hooliganism]].\n\n[[File:Shea Crowded.jpg|thumb|left|Shea Stadium filled with fans prior to the start of a [[New York Mets]] game in 2008. The stadium had the best attendance in the [[National League]] that year, garnering over 53,000 fans per game on average.]]\n\nLighter, more harmless objects are also occasionally thrown onto certain fields of play as a form of celebration of a favorable sports feat. This is most common when a member of the home team scores a [[hat trick]] in hockey. Other, more mild forms of displeasure shown by sports fans at sporting events involve simple groans of disappointment, and silence. These actions often denote that the favored home team is being outperformed by, or has lost to the much less-favored road team.\n\nIn North America, extremely enthusiastic fans are often called  \"superfans\": fans who dress up in outrageous and ostentatious costumes or outfits showing their devotion. Fanbases well known for their tenacious love and undying support are called ''[[Rabies|rabid]] fans'' or fanatics. These fans often congregate hours before kickoff in what is known as a [[tailgation]] or tailgating.\n\nAt [[Bar (establishment)|sports bars]], sports fans will gather together, often while consuming food and alcoholic beverages, with the purpose of following a particular sporting event on television as a group. Sports bars often advertise in hopes of drawing fans of a particular player or team to watch together to increase bonds between fans and prevent fights. This can create the sense of unity in a sports bar as all cheers and boos will appear to be synchronized due to similar feelings and reactions by nearly all fans at the fortunes and misfortunes of the favored team or athlete. Due to the level of devotion and intensity of feeling towards the favored team or athlete by sports bar patrons, as well as partially due to the alcohol being served, behavior that would be seen as unruly or fanatical outside a sports bar is generally more common inside of one. The intensity of cheering and jeering at a sports bar by sports fans can often range from equal to stronger than that of fans actually at the sporting event for particularly significant games and matches.\n\nAt home, sports fans may have few fellow fans but also more freedom. This is sometimes where the most intense cheering or jeering will take place. In the fan's own home, unbridled and lengthy screaming, crying, acts of destruction to household objects, and other manifestations of joy or anguish, are perhaps seen as most acceptable in comparison to the sports bar or sporting venue simply because such acts taken to such an extreme can be seen as disruptive to a large number of fellow fans even if they share the same sentiment if it is of less intensity. The greatest variables of the reaction of a sports fan in their own home are the intensity of the fan's desire to see their team win or perform well, and the presence of another: often a wife, children, or friends who may be significantly less ardent sports fans or not sports fans at all, which may significantly temper the fan's reaction to a highly positive or negative moment due to the fear of causing a scene or scaring those close to the fan, or alienating themselves from said others. Often sports fans will invite other fans of relatively similar rooting intensity over to their house to experience a sporting event together so that all involved can voice pleasure or displeasure to their heart's content and increase [[male bonding|shared bonds]] in the process. It is becoming common for this type of bonding to take place over sports-related [[social networks]].\n\n==Fan psychology and motives==\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Fan de hockey 01.jpg|thumbnail|Representation of a hockey fan]]\nThe drivers that make people fans, and in particular sports fans, have been studied by psychologists, such as Dan Wann at [[Murray State University]],<ref name=\"wann\">{{cite book |last=Wann |first=Daniel L. |title=Sport Fans: The Psychology and Social Impact of Spectators |publisher=Routledge |date=January 10, 2001 |isbn=978-0415924641}}</ref> and communication scholars, such as [[Adam Earnheardt]] at [[Youngstown State University]].<ref name=\"earnheardt1\">{{cite book |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |authorlink1=Adam Earnheardt |title=Judging Athlete Behaviors: Exploring Possible Predictors of Television Viewer Judgments of Athlete Antisocial Behaviors |publisher=AV Akademikerverlag |date=June 28, 2012 |isbn=978-3639433456}}</ref><ref name=\"earnheardt2\">{{cite book |editor-last1=Earnheardt |editor-first1=Adam C. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Hugenberg |editor-first3=Barbara |title=Sports Fans, Identity, and Socialization: Exploring the Fandemonium |publisher=Lexington Books |date=May 30, 2013 |isbn=978-0739146217}}</ref>\n\nThey attribute people becoming fans to the following factors:<ref name=Conrad>{{cite book|title=The Business of Sports: A Primer for Journalists|author=Mark Conrad|chapter=What Makes Sports a Unique Business?|pages=[https://archive.org/details/businessofsports0000conr/page/ xxx\u2013xxxi]|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-5044-9|nopp=true|url=https://archive.org/details/businessofsports0000conr/page/}}</ref> One element is entertainment, because sports spectatorship is a form of leisure. Sports is also a form of escapism, and being a fan gives one an excuse to yell at something, an activity that may be constrained in other areas of one's life. Fan activities give participants a combination of euphoria and stress (about the potential for their team to lose) for which they coin the name \"eustress\". Fans experience euphoria during moments when play is going well for their team, and stress when play is going against their team. This tension between the two emotions generates an unusual sense of pleasure or heightened sensations.<ref name=\"motives\">{{cite book |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |editor-last1=Hugenberg |editor-first1=Lawrence W. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Earnheardt |editor-first3=Adam C. |title=Sports Mania: Essays on Fandom and the Media in the 21st Century |publisher=MacFarland |date=July 16, 2008 |pages=158\u2013171 |chapter=Exploring Motives and Fandom for Viewing Televised Sports |isbn=978-0786437269}}</ref>\n\nAesthetics are another draw for some fans, who appreciate the precision or skill of play, or of the coordinated movement of the players during a pre-planned \"play\".<ref name=\"motives\" /> Family bonding is a reason for some fan activities. Some families watch televised sports on a regular basis and go to sports games as a family outing to watch events and form a [[human bonding|psychological bond]] with one another and as a family.

The term '''[[nerd]]''', defined as \"[an] insignificant, foolish, or socially inept person; a person who is boringly conventional or studious; a person who pursues an unfashionable or highly technical interest with obsessive or exclusive dedication,\"<ref>\"nerd, n.\" ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2014.</ref> as well as the term '''[[geek]]''', defined as \"[a] person [\u2026] who is regarded as foolish, offensive, worthless; an overly diligent, unsociable student; any unsociable person obsessively devoted to a particular pursuit,\"<ref>\"geek, n.\" ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2014.</ref> are often used to describe stereotypical fanboys. In regards to chosen fandoms, they are typically associated with comic books, video games, science fiction movies or television series, or technology (such as computer or smartphone brands).<ref name=\"verge\" />\n\nAn exception to this portrayal is the sports fan, who is expected to be overtly sexual, and aggressive.<ref name=\"sports\">Gosling, Victoria K. \"Girls Allowed? The Marginalization of Female Sports Fans.\" Eds. Gray, Jonathan, et al. ''Fandom: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World.'' New York: New York University Press, 2007. Print. 250-260.</ref> This portrayal is particularly dominant within the sports arena, which provides a legitimate site for men to act in hyper masculinized ways.<ref name=\"sports\" /> According to Williams, \"Many [men] want to be overtly sexist and racist. They need to have this exaggerated sense of their sexuality to defend themselves from potential accusations that they are not real men.\"<ref>Coddington, A. ''One of the Lads: Women who Follow Football.'' London: Harper Collins, 1997. Print.</ref>\n\n====Societal gender roles====\n\nAccording to [[Jackson Katz]] in the documentary ''Tough Guise 2'', boys are taught early on that to be \"real men\" they need to be tough and not to show their feelings.<ref name=\"TG2\">''Tough Guise 2.'' Writ./Dir. Jackson Katz and Jeremy Earp. Media Education Foundation Production, 2013.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[Men] can't show any emotion except anger. We can't think too much or seem too intellectual. We can't back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we're tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We're supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we're taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay.<ref name=\"TG2\" /></blockquote>\n\nHe later elaborates, stating that, \n<blockquote>Qualities like compassion, caring, empathy, intellectual curiosity, fear, vulnerability, even love \u2013 basic human qualities that boys have inside them every bit as much as girls do \u2013 get methodically driven out of them by a sexist and homophobic culture that labels these things as 'unmanly,' 'feminine,' 'womanly,' and 'gay,' and teaches boys to avoid them at all costs.\n\nAnd, most importantly, they're taught that real men turn to violence not as a last resort, but as the go-to method of resolving disputes \u2013 and also as a primary means of winning respect and establishing masculine credibility.<ref name=\"TG2\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn the predecessor to this documentary, ''Tough Guise'', Katz also addresses the issue of body image, using multiple movies, such as ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', as well as action figures like [[G.I. Joe]], to illustrate how 'real men' are defined as big, strong, and muscular.<ref>''Tough Guise.'' Writ. Jackson Katz. Dir. Sut Jhally. Media Education Foundation \nProduction, 1999.</ref>\n\nFanboy portrayals, by definition, do not fit into this mold of a 'real man', with the exception of sports fans. In a study by Gerard Jones on comic book fans, he described the comic book fanboys as \"small, anxious, withdrawn, and terrified of the opposite sex.\"<ref>Jones, Gerard. Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book. New York: Basic Books, 2004.</ref> Quite the opposite of the 'real man' previously described by Katz. Their interests may also be considered as a deviation from societal gender roles, according to Noah Berlastsky, such as playing ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' instead of football.<ref name=\"bully\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-geeks-get-bullied-its-not-necessarily-for-being-geeks/272723/2/ |title=Why Geeks Get Bullied (It's Not Necessarily for Being Geeks) |magazine=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>  This lack of traditional masculine traits warrants them much teasing from peers, parental figures, coaches, or older male role models for not conforming to these ideas of masculinity.<ref name=\"TG2\" /><ref name=\"bully\" /><ref>Pustz, Matthew. ''Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers.'' Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1999.</ref> A popular example of such treatment in mainstream media is shown on the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', where, multiple times throughout the show's run, the four main characters, portrayed as 'nerdy fanboys', are humiliated by larger 'real men'. For instance, in the show pilot, the two main characters, Leonard and Sheldon, get their pants taken by the main female character's ex-boyfriend, who is portrayed as big, strong, tough, confident, and successful with women.<ref>\"Pilot.\" ''The Big Bang Theory.''

Television, California, USA. 24 Sept. 2007.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, fanboys also deal with issues of gender discrimination in relation to their fandom interests. For example, [[Bronies]], a group of young men enthralled by the TV show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', a show typically geared towards young girls, are often the target of ridicule. Their interest in a 'feminine' media item can be the cause of great shame, causing many to become 'private' bronies, enjoying the show in secret out of fear.<ref name=\"bronies\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV0lDp3I58I |title=BABScon 2014 - Bronies; An Analysis of Fandom and Gender |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\n{{see also|Crowd abuse|:Category:Association football hooliganism}}\nFanboys are often portrayed as quite angry, violent, and offensive while defending the objects of their affection, such as the smartphone fanboys who frequently verbally attack anybody saying anything the slightest bit offensive about their chosen technological product through online anonymous sites.<ref name=\"verge\" /> In fact, the term 'fanboy' is often used as an insult towards other fans, deemed unreasonable, arrogant, or overly loyal to their chosen token of affection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSuch defensiveness is particularly prominent against women who are interested in their chosen fandoms or who pose a \"threat\" to their community. For example, in 2012, male gamers created a Flash game in which players could physically assault [[Anita Sarkeesian]], a woman who launched a Kickstarter to create a series of documentaries on women tropes in video games.<ref name=\"fridge\">{{cite web|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/460/384 |title=Fangirls in refrigerators: The politics of (in)visibility in comic book culture &#124; Scott &#124; Transformative Works and Cultures |publisher=Journal.transformativeworks.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThese violent acts against Sarkeesian continued in 2014, during the controversial event or movement known as [[GamerGate]], during which Sarkeesian received numerous threats by fanboys due to her Tropes vs Women series on YouTube, where she analyzes the alleged limited and sexist female roles available in video games.

The term is often used in a demeaning, derogatory fashion to describe the fans that give \"normal\" fans a bad name. In fact, the term \"fangirling\" is used to describe anyone who obsessively follows a certain [[fandom]] to the point where it interferes with their daily lives. Such a trend of 'authentic' versus 'inauthentic' fan is common within fan communities, and is particularly pertinent to gender discrimination and misogynistic ideals.<ref name=\"fridge\" /> However, on the other hand of the spectrum, some fangirls have embraced the title, considering it a compliment rather than a derogatory term.\n\n====Discrimination====\nWomen tend to be \"more restricted in their leisure choices and opportunities than men,\"<ref name=\"sports\" /> and their experiences within fandoms are typically demeaned to a more sexualized, emotional, or bodily experience, as opposed to intellectual interests.<ref name=\"groupies\">Cline, Cheryl. \"Essays from Bitch: The Women's Rock Newsletter with Bite.\" Ed.

But 'groupie' is also used more or less synonymously with 'girl Rock fan', 'female journalist', and 'woman Rock musician'; it's used to mean anyone working in the music field who isn't actually a Rock musician; it's used as an all-purpose insult and a slut on one's professionalism; it's used as a cute term for 'hero worship'; and it's used interchangeably with 'fan'.<ref name=\"groupies\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn other words, the term 'groupie' (used synonymously with the term 'fan' or 'fangirl') is frequently used to shame women involved within the music community, restricting their involvement to sexual relations with band members or worshipping male rock stars.<ref name=\"groupies\" />\n\nThis trend can also be observed within other fan communities, such as comic book fandoms, where women are frequently portrayed as \"Fake Geek Girls\", only interested in comic books to impress guys or to view the attractive men present within their content,<ref name=\"geek\" /><ref>{{cite news|author=Gavia Baker-Whitelaw |url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/fake-geek-girls-geek-guys-buzzfeed/ |title=The absurdity of this 'fake geek guys' video makes a powerful point |work=The Daily Dot |date=2014-08-27 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref> or sports communities, where women are often made uncomfortable at live sporting events due to the overt sexism and aggressive masculinity displayed by male spectators, and then labelled as 'inauthentic' for viewing the games via television instead.<ref name=\"sports\" /> Within hockey, female fans are often called \"Puck Bunnies\", defined as,\n\n<blockquote>[S]omeone who hangs around the players, always on the lookout for the chance to get that autograph / photograph / quick pint [drink] / quick knee trem-bler round the back of the Arena from the player or players (or even coach) of their choice, heck let's face it even the water carrier is in with a chance here.<ref name=\"hockey\" /></blockquote>\n\nSuch discrimination against female fans can become violent at times in an effort to police \"authenticity\".<ref name=\"fridge\" /> The recent events known as [[GamerGate]] provide a good example of such attacks, whereby multiple women working within the gaming industry were victims of sexual harassment and violent threats, some even forced to leave their homes for fear of a physical confrontation.<ref name=\"anita\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29821050 |title=Zoe Quinn: GamerGate must be condemned - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Frase|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/in-defense-of-gamers/ |title=In Defense of Gamers |publisher=Jacobin |date=2014-10-04 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}</ref>\n\n====Conduct and age====\n\nIn terms of their involvement within fandoms, fangirls are typically portrayed as losing all control, fainting, sobbing, and dashing about in mobs.<ref name=\"beatles\">Ehrenreich, Barbara, Elizabeth Hess, and Gloria Jacobs. \"Beatlemania: Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" Ed.

Girls peed in their pants, fainted, or simply collapsed from the emotional strain.<ref name=\"beatles\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe fangirls' so-called 'hysteria' is described as the product of sexual repression.<ref name=\"beatles\" /> However, while it is expected for women to be involved in certain fandoms for physical or sexual reasons, this is also viewed as undesirable and driven by hormonal changes.\n\nThese acts of adoration are societally limited to adolescent youth, or menopausal women, in both instances blaming \"these two periods of hormonal lunacy\" on the irrational, overtly sexual behaviour.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> For instance, Cheryl Cline, in her text entitled \"Essays from Bitch: The Women's Rock Newsletter with Bite\", discusses how women need to keep their interests hidden once they pass adolescence.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> In her own words, \"[i]t's a sign of maturity to pack up all the posters, photos, magazines, scrapbooks, and unauthorized biographies you so lovingly collected and shove them in the back of the closet.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> Furthermore, while discussing Beatlemania and the crazed Beatles fangirl behaviour, Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Heiss, and Gloria Jacobs mention how the 'only cure' for what was at the time considered an affliction was age, and that similarly to \"the girls who had screamed for Frank Sinatra,\" the Beatles fangirls would \"[grow] up to be responsible, settled housewives.\"<ref name=\"beatles\" />\n\nThese conflicting accounts of fangirl behaviour are due to the belief that women are not supposed to express such sexual fantasies unless influenced by some hormonal induced craziness, while for men it is normal to be sexual regardless of age.<ref name=\"groupies\" /> As Cheryl Cline summarizes, \n<blockquote>It's much easier for a man to be indulgent about the crushes of teenage girls than it is for him to be fair-minded about the sexual fantasies of the woman he loves when they're about someone else. And the same guy who'll leave ''Penthouse'' in the bathroom will yell, 'No woman of mine is gonna hang a poster of Prince naked to the waist on the inside of the closet of the spare room where no one will see it!' [\u2026] [U]ntil you reach the age when everybody thinks you're crazy anyway, so why not admit to an intense hankering to run your fingers through Willie Nelson's whiskers?<ref name=\"groupies\" /></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fan art]]\n* [[Fan club]]\n* [[Fansite]]\n* [[Fan activism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Daniel L.

The first African American school was located in Central Baptist Church at Madeley Quarters. The Conroe Independent School District was created by the Commissioners Court of Montgomery County, Texas, July 12, 1892, by consolidating the twelve Common School Districts surrounding Conroe. This area covered 25 square miles.\n\nConroe ISD was created on July 12, 1892 by the Commissioners Court of Montgomery County, Texas. At that time, the County Judge was ex officio Superintendent of Schools and he appointed three trustees to assist him. Later, a County School Superintendent and three trustees were elected by a vote of the people to act as treasurer of school tax money and serve as administrators over the community schools of the county.\n\nThe first graduating class of Conroe High School, one male and three females, received their diplomas in 1902. The 39th Legislature of the State of Texas in 1925 mandated the enlargement of the District by keeping intact the already defined 25 square miles and adding numerous other surrounding school areas bringing the district to 333 square miles. Prior to the 1925 consolidation, few children in rural areas were able to attend high school.\n\nConroe ISD currently occupies 60 campuses over the 348 square miles that the District encompasses. The oldest campus is Travis Intermediate School, formerly Crockett High School.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.conroeisd.net/about/history-of-conroe-isd/|title=History of Conroe ISD - Conroe ISD|last=ISD|first=Conroe|work=Conroe ISD|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\n=== Secondary schools ===\n\n==== High schools (9\u201312) ====\n[[File:The Woodlands College Park Front Image.jpg|thumb|[[The Woodlands College Park High School]]]]\n[[File:Oakridge2MontGoCo.jpg|thumb|[[Oak Ridge High School (Montgomery County, Texas)|Oak Ridge High School]]]]\n[[File:ThewoodlandsHS.JPG|thumb|[[The Woodlands High School]]]]\n* [[Conroe High School]] and Conroe High School 9th Grade Campus ([[Conroe, Texas|Conroe]])\n** [[Academy of Science & Health Professions]]\n* [[Oak Ridge High School (Montgomery County, Texas)|Oak Ridge High School]] and Oak Ridge High School 9th Grade Campus (Conroe, Uninc.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel.

These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery.

On Sundays her family would pack up the family van, hook up the trailer with all the Motocross Bikes and head out to the riding field. One Sunday out at the motocross track she noticed a bunch of kids racing bicycles on a dirt track set up in the corner of the field. She quickly became interested. The next Sunday, in addition to the motorcycles she packed her [[Schwinn Bicycle Company#Child and youth markets|Schwinn Stingray]] in the van. It was the summer of 1974, a ten-year-old girl among all boys, she paid the $2 entry fee, taped a mocked up paper plate number to her handlebars, and lined up across a flat starting line when her heat was called.

{"title_page": "Old Irish grammar", "text_new": "This article describes the grammar of the [[Old Irish]] language.\n\n==Grammatical processes==\n\n===Initial mutations===\n\nIn the system of initial consonant mutations, the initial consonant of a word is modified in one or another way, depending on the nature of the preceding word: ''la tech'' {{IPA|/la t\u02b2ex/}} \"towards a house\" vs. ''fo thech'' {{IPA|/fo \u03b8\u02b2ex/}} \"under a house\", ''i tech'' {{IPA|/i d\u02b2ex/}} \"into a house\", with the alternation {{IPA|/t ~ \u03b8 ~ d/}} in the initial consonant of ''tech'' \"house\" triggered by the preceding preposition.\n\nThere are three types of mutation: \n* Lenition, a weakening of the initial consonant. This generally turns plosives into fricatives, among other effects.\n* Nasalisation, originally a prepending of a nasal consonant to the word, which caused further changes.\n* Aspiration and gemination, causing either gemination of the initial consonant, or the insertion of {{IPA|/h/}}.\n\nThe mutations became an important part of the grammar and remain, with little change, in Modern Irish (see [[Irish initial mutations]]). They were often crucial in distinguishing various grammatical forms, which would be homophones if not for the mutations. For example, in the case of the possessive determiner ''a'', only the initial mutation of the following word distinguishes the meanings \"his\", \"her\", and \"their\":\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Meanings distinguished by initial mutations\n! No change\n! Lenition\n! Nasalization\n! Aspiration/gemination\n|-\n| ''ech'' {{IPA|/ex/}} \"horse\"\n| ''a ech'' {{IPA|/a ex/}} \"his horse\"\n| ''a n-ech'' {{IPA|/a nex/}} \"their horse\"\n| ''a ech'' {{IPA|/a hex/}} \"her horse\"\n|-\n| ''bo'' {{IPA|/bo/}} \"cow\"\n| ''a bo'' {{IPA|/a vo/}} \"his cow\"\n| ''a m-bo'' {{IPA|/a mbo/}} \"their cow\"\n| ''a bo'' {{IPA|/a bbo/}} \"her cow\"\n|-\n| ''tech'' {{IPA|/t\u02b2ex/}} \"house\"\n| ''a thech'' {{IPA|/a \u03b8\u02b2ex/}} \"his house\"\n| ''a tech'' {{IPA|/a d\u02b2ex/}} \"their house\"\n| ''a tech'' {{IPA|/a tt\u02b2ex/}} \"her house\"\n|-\n| ''fer becc'' {{IPA|/f\u02b2er b\u02b2e\u0261/}} \"small man\" (nominative)\n| ''d\u00e1 fer becc'' {{IPA|/da\u02d0 er v\u02b2e\u0261/}} \"two small men\" (nominative)\n| ''fer m-becc'' {{IPA|/f\u02b2er mb\u02b2e\u0261/}} \"small man\" (accusative)\n|\n|}\n\nAnother grammatical feature signalled by mutations is [[relative clause]] attachment, in which lenition indicates the beginning of a relative clause, often in place of any explicit [[relative pronoun]] (although in some cases the verbal ending also changes to a special relative form).\n\nIn general, there is no way to predict from the form of a given word the type of mutation that it will trigger. (Note that the spelling of the initial consonant does not always change to indicate mutation in Old Irish although it generally does starting in Middle Irish).\n\nInitial mutations were originally [[sandhi]] effects, and depended on the shape of the original final syllable in Primitive Irish. It was grammaticalised by the loss of final syllables in the transition from Primitive Irish to Old Irish. In Old Irish, the process was already grammatical to a large degree, and was limited to applying across words within a single syntactic phrase (e.g. between a noun and a modifying adjective, or between a preposition and the rest of the prepositional phrase). Initial mutations did not apply across phrase boundaries generally, but there are some instances where this does occur in the earliest Old Irish attestations.\n\n====Lenition====\n\nLenition is the weakening of a consonant according to a particular pattern. It applied to consonants appearing between vowels in Primitive Irish. When a preceding word ended in a vowel, the first consonant of the following word was lenited.\n\nLenition was not indicated in the spelling except in the case of initial voiceless stops, which were written ''ph th ch'' when lenited. In later Old Irish, initial ''f s'' come to be written ''\u1e1f \u1e61'' when lenited, with a dot (a so-called ''punctum delens'') above the letter.\n\nLenition occurs after:\n* Certain case forms within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive. These include, at least:\n** Nominative and vocative singular of all feminines\n** Dative singular of all genders\n** Nominative, vocative, accusative and genitive dual of all masculines and feminines\n** Nominative, vocative and accusative plural of all neuters (but inconsistently after ''-a'')\n* Certain prepositions\n* Certain conjunctions\n* Certain infixed pronouns\n\n====Nasalisation====\n\nNasalisation, also known as eclipsis in Modern Irish grammar, is the prepending of a nasal consonant to the word. It was caused by a preceding word ending in a nasal consonant. Due to later changes involving clusters of nasals and other consonants, in particular the coalescing of nasal-stop clusters to voiceless plosives (such as {{IPA|/nt/}} > {{IPA|/d/}}), nasalisation may also manifest itself as voicing in Old Irish.\n\nNasalisation was not indicated in the spelling except for initial voiced stops and vowels, where ''n-'' is prefixed (''m-'' before ''b'').\n\nNasalisation occurs after:\n* Certain case forms within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive. These include, at least:\n** Nominative, vocative and accusative singular and dual of all neuters\n** Accusative singular of all masculines and feminines\n** Genitive plural of all genders\n* Certain prepositions\n* Certain conjunctions\n* Certain infixed pronouns\n\n====Aspiration and gemination====\n\nOriginally two different effects, aspiration and gemination came to be triggered in the same environments and thus can be treated as one type of mutation.\n\nAspiration involved prepending an additional {{IPA|/h/}} to a vowel-initial word. It was primarily caused by syllables formerly ending in {{IPA|/s/}}, which lenited to {{IPA|/h/}} between vowels. In gemination, an initial consonant was geminated by a preceding word originally ending in {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}} after a vowel. By analogy, words originally ending in {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} came to aspiration before vowel-initial words as well.\n\nGemination was only occasionally indicated, and as geminated consonants were in the process of reducing to single consonants in Old Irish times, the mutation effect itself was waning. Aspiration was not indicated at all.\n\nAspiration/gemination occurs after:\n* Within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive, all forms that end in a vowel but do not trigger lenition or nasalisation. This includes, at least:\n** Genitive singular of all feminines\n** Vocative and accusative plural of all genders\n* Certain prepositions\n* ''n\u00ed'' and ''ba''\n\n===Palatalisation===\n\nPalatalisation as such is phonological, but it also has a grammatical aspect to it. Certain case forms of nouns automatically trigger palatalisation of the final consonant of a word, as do forms of verbs. Consequently, the quality of the final consonant can often vary between different forms of the same word.\n\nPalatalisation also occurs when a syllable that originally contained a front vowel undergoes syncope. Since Old Irish generalised the palatal or nonpalatal quality across an entire consonant cluster, when the front vowel was lost, the palatalisation of the preceding consonants \"extended\" to the entire resulting consonant cluster, consisting of both the consonants before the syncopated vowel and the consonants after it. This could lead to alternations between palatalisation in the syncopated forms and nonpalatalisation in the unsyncopated forms of a word. For example, the noun ''dorus'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dorus/}} \"door\" originally had a front vowel ''e'' in the second syllable (Proto-Celtic ''*dworestu''), but this did not cause palatalisation due to the u-affection of the final vowel. However, when the noun was syncopated in certain case forms, the palatalisation reappeared and spread also to the final ''s'', seen in the genitive singular ''doirseo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dor\u02b2s\u02b2o/}} and dative plural ''doirsib'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dor\u02b2s\u02b2\u0259v\u02b2/}}.\n\nPalatalisation can sometimes affect the immediately preceding vowel:\n* ''\u00eda'' \u2192 ''\u00e9''.\n* ''\u00e1e'', ''\u00f3e'' \u2192 ''a\u00ed'', ''o\u00ed''. This is purely an orthographical distinction, and is not adhered to strongly in the manuscripts. It's used more often in normalised spellings for clarity.\n\n===Vowel affection===\n\nVowel affection is the changing of the height of a vowel to more closely match the height of the vowel in a following syllable. It is similar to [[Germanic umlaut]], but more pervasive. It was originally a relatively automatic process, but because the final vowels were later mostly lost in the transition to Old Irish, the process became unpredictable and grammaticalised. Three different kinds of vowel affection existed in Old Irish, ''lowering'', ''raising'' and ''u-insertion''.\n\n'''Lowering''' was caused by a (former) low vowel ''a'' or ''o'' in the following syllable, and affected the underlying short vowels ''i'' and ''u'', changing them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively. It occurred regardless of the preceding consonants, and was thus rather common.\n\n'''Raising''' was the reverse development: when followed by a (former) high vowel, short ''i'' or ''u'', in the following syllable, the vowels ''e'' and ''o'' were changed to ''i'' and ''u''. It did not occur in all cases, as it was limited by the intervening consonants. It occurred only when at most one consonant stood between the syllables, and the consonant had to be voiced (this included sonorants). Thus, while the noun ''cenn'' {{IPA|/k\u02b2eN/}} was raised to ''cinn'' {{IPA|/k\u02b2iN\u02b2/}} in the genitive singular form (along with palatalisation), ''ech'' {{IPA|/ex/}} was not raised and retained its original vowel in its genitive singular form ''eich'' {{IPA|/ex\u02b2/}}.\n\nThe underlying vowel of a word remained when the vowel ''e'' formerly followed. For example, in masculine o-stems, the vocative singular form had ''e'' in the ending, but the other forms had other vowels which caused either raising or lowering. In neuter o-stems, ''all'' forms had raising or lowering endings, none originally contained ''e''. This can make it difficult to ascertain what the original underlying vowel was.\n\n'''U-insertion''' was a third effect, caused by a (formerly) following ''u''. It involved inserting the vowel ''u'' (or ''o'', as an orthographic variant) after an existing vowel, and occurred with the long vowel ''\u00e9'' and the short vowels ''a'', ''e'' and ''i''. The results were as follows:\n* ''a'' \u2192 ''au''.\n* ''e'' \u2192 ''iu'' if raising can take place, ''eu''/''eo'' otherwise.\n* ''i'' \u2192 ''iu''.\n* ''\u00e9'' \u2192 ''\u00e9u''/''\u00e9o'', sometimes also ''\u00edu''.\nU-insertion did not necessarily occur in all cases where it might be expected, in particular when the ''u'' that might cause the effect was still present. For example, the accusative plural of ''ech'' may be ''euchu''/''eochu'', but ''echu'' is also found, lacking u-insertion. For ''fer'', the accusative plural is ''firu'', never ''*fiuru''.\n\n==Nouns==\nOld Irish has 3 [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter; 3 [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and [[plural]]; and 5 [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative]]. The dual is predominantly preceded by the [[cardinal number]] {{lang|sga|d\u00e1}} \"two\".\nThe full range of forms is only evident in the noun phrase, where the article causes noun initial mutation, and where the initials of following adjectives are mutated according to the underlying case ending, though at times such mutations were not written. In the following, L shows lenition, N shows nasalisation, and H shows aspiration/gemination. In addition, there was some [[syncretism]] in forms regardless of mutations: certain forms were always identical. These were:\n* Nominative/vocative/accusative of all neuter nouns in all numbers.\n* Nominative/vocative/accusative dual of all nouns.\n* Vocative/accusative plural of all nouns.\n* Dative dual/plural of all nouns.\n\n===o-stems===\n\nThe o-stems could be masculine or neuter, and were the most widespread kind of noun, thus this class is well attested. They descend from the Proto-Indo-European thematic inflection. They are characterized by a genitive singular formed by palatalizing the final consonant of the word. Some monosyllables may have their root vowel ''e'' or ''o'' raised to ''i'' or ''u'' respectively when forming the genitive singular. Additionally, their dative singular forms are a constant target for u-infection.\n\nThe masculine o-stems' nominative plurals were identical to their genitive singulars and had an accusative plural ending in ''-u''. The accusative plural tended to trigger vowel raising, syncope of multisyllabic words, and occasionally u-infection.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Masculine o-stems\n! rowspan=2|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|fer}} (\"man\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|sorn}} (\"furnace, oven\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|claideb}} (\"sword\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|ball}} (\"part\")\n|-\n!

Like the i-stems, monosyllables would have their nominative singular root vowel lowered from ''i'' and ''u'' to ''e'' and ''o'' in the genitive singular form. Feminine u-stem nouns had originally existed, but they had all been converted into \u0101-stems by the time Old Irish was written. The major difference between u-stems and i-stems were that the nominative singular and its homophones always ended in an unpalatalized consonant, when the opposite was true of the i-stems. None of the endings triggered palatalisation by themselves. However, palatalisation did occur when a syllable (formerly) containing a front vowel was contracted; the front vowel itself would then be erased by a u-infection in the inflections that did not involve this syncope.\n\nThe masculine u-stem nominative plural was often in flux, and attestations varied wildly in its form, with endings in ''-e'', ''-a'', and ''-i'' all being attested.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Masculine u-stems\n! rowspan=2|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|guth}} (\"voice, sound\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|ammus}} (\"attempt\")\n|-\n!

Demonstrative adjectives have proximal, medial, and distal forms.\n\n==Verbs==\nVerbs stand initially in the sentence (preceded only by some particles, forming a \"verbal complex\", and very few adverbs). The verb can be either suffixed for tense, person, mood and aspect (often portmanteau suffixes), or these can be shown by vowel changes in the stem (e.g. {{lang|sga|as\u00b7b'''ei'''r}} present \"says\", {{lang|sga|as\u00b7rub'''a'''rt}} past \"said\", {{lang|sga|as\u00b7b'''\u00e9'''ra}} future \"will say\").  Before this core \"verb phrase\" are placed various other preverbal [[clitic]] particles, e.g. negative ''ni-/n\u00ed-'', perfective ''ro-'' or one or more preverbal particles that add meaning of the verb stem (compare {{lang|la|\u0101-}}, {{lang|la|ex-}}, {{lang|la|in-}}, {{lang|la|d\u0113-}}, etc. in Latin verbs). Personal pronouns as direct objects are infixed between the preverb and the verbal stem. In an overall sense, the verb structure is agglutinative. A single verb can stand as an entire sentence in Old Irish, in which case emphatic particles such as {{lang|sga|-sa}} and {{lang|sga|-se}} are affixed to the end of the verb.\n\nVerbs are conjugated in [[present tense|present]], [[imperfect]], [[past tense|past]], [[future tense|future]] and [[preterite]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]; indicative, [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]] [[grammatical mood|moods]]; and active and passive [[Grammatical voice|voices]]. The only verbal form lacking in Old Irish is the [[infinitive]], this covered, as in the modern Gaelic languages, by the verbal noun.  Old Irish inherits a large amount of [[Proto-Indo-European verbs|Indo-European verbal morphology]], including:\n\n* extensive [[ablaut]] variations, made significantly more complicated by vowel affection and syncope\n* [[reduplication]]\n* primary and secondary endings\n* [[thematic vowel|thematic and athematic endings]]\n* [[deponent verb]]s\n* multiple ways of forming each of the various tenses and moods, and no general cross-tense/mood [[grammatical conjugation|conjugational classes]], i.e. in general a series of [[principal part]]s must be memorised for each verb, much as in [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]].\n* ''n''-infix verbs\n\n===Independent and dependent forms===\n\nMost verbs have, in addition to the tenses, voices, and moods named above, two sets of forms: [[Dependent and independent verb forms|an independent and a dependent conjugation]]. The independent conjugation occurs when the verb occurs absolutely sentence-initial with no preverbs, while the dependent conjugation occurs when the verb is preceded by one or more preverbs. The formation of the independent and dependent conjugations depends on whether a verb is '''simple''' or '''complex'''. A complex verb is a verb that is always combined with a preverb, while all other verbs are simple verbs. The dependent conjugation of a simple verb is essentially the same as the independent conjugation of a complex verb, though different terminology is used:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Independent\n! Dependent\n|-\n! Simple verb\n| Absolute inflection\n| Conjunct inflection\n|-\n! Complex verb\n| Deuterotonic inflection\n| Prototonic inflection\n|}\n\nThe absolute and conjunct inflections are distinguished primarily by the endings, e.g. ''biru'' \"I carry\", ''berid'' \"he carries\" vs. ''n\u00ed-biur'' \"I do not carry\", ''n\u00ed-beir'' \"he does not carry\" (with negative prefix ''n\u00ed-''). The difference between absolute and conjunct endings is thought to reflect an additional particle ''*-es'' added to the absolute verbal form.{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=363}} Final ''-i'' in the conjunct forms was apparently lost early on (cf. a similar change in Latin).\n\nThe difference between deuterotonic and prototonic inflections involves a stress shift. The stress is always placed on the second preverb from the beginning, due to the Celtic version of [[Wackernagel's law]]. Consequently, when a preverb is attached to a verb that already has one, the stress shifts one preverb to the left. This stress shift is accompanied by (sometimes radical) changes in the verbal stem and all but the first preverbal particle(s), which merge with the stem, e.g. ''do\u22c5berat'' \"they bring/give\", ''as\u22c5berat'' \"they say\" vs. ''n\u00ed-taibret'' \"they do not bring/give\", ''n\u00ed-epret'' \"they do not say\". In the ''s''-subjunctive, the allomorphy is even more extreme, especially in the third-person singular: indicative ''as\u22c5boind'' \"he refuses\" vs. ''n\u00ed\u22c5opaind'' \"he does not refuse\", subjunctive ''as\u22c5b\u00f3'' \"he may refuse\" vs. ''n\u00ed\u22c5op'' \"he may not refuse\". In many cases, from a [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] perspective, the changes appear utterly random (''do\u22c5r\u00f3sc(a)i'' \"he surpasses\" vs. ''n\u00ed-derscaigi'' \"he does not surpass\") or even unrecognisable (''imm\u22c5so\u00ed'' \"he turns around\" vs. ''n\u00ed-impa\u00ed'' \"he does not turn around\"). However, the forms usually result from a series of regular [[sound change]]s.<ref group=*>Primitive Irish *di-s-<u>ro</u>-uss-skok\u012bt vs. *n\u012b-s-<u>di</u>-ro-uss-skok\u012bt, *embi-s-<u>sa</u>wet vs. *n\u012b-s-<u>em</u>bi-sawet, with the stressed syllable underlined.</ref> A few verbs form their prototonic forms irregularly. Two verbs beginning with the prefix ''ro-'', ''ro\u00b7cluinethar'' (\"to hear\") and ''ro\u00b7finnadar'' form their prototonic forms by solely deleting the prefix without any stem change. Two other verbs, ''fo\u00b7ceird'' (\"to put\" or \"to throw\") and ''do\u00b7bidci'' (\"to shoot, hurl\") use [[suppletion]] to create their prototonic forms.\n\n===Classification===\n\nTwo main classifications of Old Irish verbs exist, both based on the formation of the present indicative: the Thurneysen classification and the McCone classification. Both systems classify verbs broadly between weak and strong, the distinction being that weak verbs have a 3rd person singular conjunct form ending in a vowel, while strong verbs have a 3rd person singular conjunct form ending in a consonant. This distinction, like the strong-weak distinction found in the [[Germanic languages]], reflects the PIE split between primary and secondary verbs. McCone's system additionally has a separate class for so-called \"hiatus\" verbs, in which the root itself ends in a vowel rather than the verb having a vocalic suffix, as in the \"true\" weak verbs. Thurneysen groups these with the weak verbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Thurneysen\n! McCone\n! Characteristic\n! Example\n! Origin\n|-\n| A I\n| W1\n| 3rd sg. conj.

''ara\u00b7chrinat''\n| PIE -new- ~ -nu-\n|}\n\nOld Irish verbs have, however, up to five [[principal part]]s, so that for the complete conjugation of a verb all five inflectional stems must be known. These are:\n* Present stem: forms the present and imperfect indicative, and the imperative.\n* Subjunctive stem: forms the present and past subjunctive\n* Future stem: forms the future\n* Preterite active stem: forms the active preterite forms\n* Preterite passive stem: forms the passive preterite forms\n\n===Reduplication===\n\nReduplication in Old Irish verbal conjugation tends to happen in the formation of s-futures, a-futures and reduplicated preterites, especially in strong verbs.\n\n* In reduplicated preterites, the first syllable of the reduplicated root consists of the first root-initial consonant followed by /e/. The following syllable would begin with the root-initial consonants (that were not previously deleted) followed by ''a'' and then the root-final consonant. No endings were added in the first and second person singular forms. In the third-person singular, the root-final consonant was always slender, while the plural forms had endings.\n* In s-futures and a-futures, the first syllable's vowel was instead often /i/, which may be lowered by a-affection to /e/.\n\nHowever, due to various historical phonetic deletions, the reduplication may not be obvious, and in some cases the reduplication of one verb would be analogically extended to other verbs that did not reduplicate similarly. For example, ''sligid'' \"strikes down\" has a reduplicated preterite ''selaig'' \"struck down\" and an s-future ''silis'' \"will strike down\", with a lost reduplicated ''s'' formerly in front of the ''l'' in both paradigms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Reduplicated conjugations in Old Irish verbs <br/> (all conjugations are in the third person singular absolute or deuterotonic unless noted)\n!

Reduplicating ''*k'' in the middle of the word was then lost, causing [[compensatory lengthening]]. Long ''o'' proceeded to break into a diphthong. Future stem demonstrates lowering of reduplicating ''i'' to ''e'' in front of ''a''.\n| hears\n|-\n| ''fichid''\n| ''f\u00edch''\n| ''feis''\n| Proto-Celtic reduplicating ''*w'' was lost intervocally, but remained word-initially as Old Irish ''f''.\n| fights\n|}\n\n===Augmentation===\nOld Irish verbs may systematically use certain verbal prefixes to express either [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect aspect]] or [[Potential mood|potentiality]]. Such prefixes are called '''augments'''. Perfective augmentation is generally performed on the preterite indicative, creating perfect-aspect forms, while potential augmentation is applied to subjunctive forms. Both augmentations may be done albeit much less commonly on the present indicative, and rarely appear elsewhere.\n\nThe vast majority of verbs use ''ro-'' as their augment. However, there are several major exceptions to using ''ro-''. \n\n* Verbs formed with prefixed ''com-'' (or its allomorph ''con-'') usually use ''ad-'' as their augment.\n* Some irregularly distributed compound verbs use ''com-'' as its augment.\n* ''ibid'' (\"to drink\") uses ''ess-''.\n* ''saidid'' (\"to sit\") and ''laigid'' (\"to lie (down, etc.)\") combine ''d\u00ed-'' and ''in-'' to form their augments.\n* ''tongaid'' (\"to swear\") combines ''to-'' and ''com-'' to create its augment.\n* ''mligid'' (\"to milk\") combines ''to-'' and ''uss-'' to make its augment.\n* Some verbs supplete an unrelated verb stem entirely to serve as their augmented forms.\n\nFurthermore, some verbs are prohibited from using augments entirely.\n\n===Subjunctive stem types===\n\nThe subjunctive comes in three variants, all continuing the PIE ''s''-aorist subjunctive.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Type\n! Verb types\n|-\n| ''a''-subjunctive\n| Weak and hiatus verbs, strong verbs with a root ending in any other consonant\n|-\n| ''e''-subjunctive\n| Hiatus verbs with a root ending in ''i''\n|-\n| ''s''-subjunctive\n| Strong verbs with a root ending in a dental or velar consonant or in ''-nn''\n|}\n\nIn the ''s''-subjunctive, the ''s'' is attached directly to the root. The endings are partly athematic, especially the 3rd singular, with original suffix ''*-s-t'' that leads to truncation of the root: cf. ''as\u00b7boind'' \"he refuses\" < {{IPA|*uss-\u02c8bond-et}}, prototonic ''\u00b7op(a)ind'' < {{IPA|*\u02c8uss-bond-et}}; subj.

''as\u00b7b\u00f3is'' < {{IPA|*uss-\u02c8bod-s-es}}, prototonic ''\u00b7obbais'' < {{IPA|*\u02c8uss-bod-s-es}} with thematic ''*-s-es''.<ref group=*>The root of this verb is *bod-, originally *bud- < PIE *bhudh- (cognate with [[Old English]] ''b\u0113odan'' \"to offer, announce\", [[Sanskrit]] ''bodhati'' \"to awaken, inquire\"); the variant *bod- occurred in the present indicative through ''a''-infection and was generalised. The *-n- is a present-tense infix (cf. the cognate [[Ancient Greek]] verb ''punth\u00e1nomai'' \"I inquire\", [[aorist]] ''eputh\u00f3m\u0113n'' \"I inquired\").</ref>\n\nIn the ''e''-subjunctive, the root-final vowel ''i'' of a suitable hiatus verb is transformed into ''e'' in the subjunctive and is followed directly by a personal ending with neither ''-s-'' nor ''-a-'' being additionally suffixed in between.\n\nThe below table, comparing the conjugations of the ''a''- and ''s-''subjunctives, uses ''beirid'' \"to carry\" and ''do\u00b7beir'' (prototonic ''\u00b7tabair'') \"to give, bring\" as examples of ''a''-subjunctive formation while ''t\u00e9it'' \"to go\" and ''at\u00b7reig'' \"to rise\" serve as examples of ''s''-subjunctive formations. For ''e''-subjunctive formations, these are sparsely attested outside of the very common verbs {{lang|sga|at\u00b7t\u00e1}} \"to be\" and {{lang|sga|do\u00b7gn\u00ed}} \"to do\", and go unused in the prototonic forms of compounds, where ''a''-subjunctives are used instead.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comparison of subjunctive conjugation classes\n! rowspan=3| !! colspan=3| ''a''-subjunctive !! colspan=3| ''s''-subjunctive !! colspan=3| ''e''-subjunctive\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Absolute !! colspan=2|Conjunct !! rowspan=2|Absolute !! colspan=2|Conjunct !! rowspan=2|Absolute !!

These serve as direct object pronouns and are always attached onto the preverb preceding the stressed portion of a deuterotonic verbal complex. If a deuterotonic formation does not exist by default (due to the verb being simple in the first place), the preverb ''no'' is used with the conjunct forms of the simple verb to concoct a deuterotonic form.\n\nThe infixed pronouns belong to three classes, conventionally labelled A, B, and C. The three classes vary by the phonological context of the preverb (classes A and B) or syntactical context of the clause containing it (Class C vs. Classes A and B).\n* Class A pronouns are used after preverbs that historically ended in vowels, such as ''do-'' (preverbal form of ''to-'' and ''d\u00ed-''), ''ro-'', ''fo-'', ''no-'', ''imm-'', and ''ar-''. They are also used after the verbal negation particle ''n\u00ed''. For ''imm-'' and ''ar-'', a vowel was used to link the preverb and the Class A pronoun. This vowel was overall random but tended to be ''-u-''.\n* Class B pronouns are used after preverbs historically ending in consonants. They are characterized by starting with /d/, spelled as ''t'' or ''d'' (the forms beginning with ''t'' in the below table can also be sometimes spelled with ''d'') and their irregular fusions with their preverbs.\n* Class C pronouns are used with verbs within a nasalized subordinate clause. They all contain a voiced dental fricative /\u00f0/, spelled ''d''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish infixed direct object pronouns\n! colspan=2| !! Class A !! Class B !!

On the other hand, it is itself suppressed by the negative particle ''n\u00ed'' \"does not\", leaving only mutational effects behind.\n* Class B pronouns replace the final consonant of all their preverbs except ''etar-'' and ''for-''. They also irregularly merge ''in-'' with ''ad-'' when attached.\n* Class C pronouns in the third-person singular masculine and neuter are further subdivided based on either phonological context or the particle preceding the verb.\n** ''-d'' appears where the Class A pronoun would otherwise be used.\n** ''-id'' appears where the  Class B pronoun would otherwise be used.\n** ''-did'' when the clause is preceded by ''i'' \"into which\" or ''co'' \"so that\".\n\n===Possessive pronouns===\nPossessive pronouns in Old Irish, as expected, have genitive function. Additionally, when modifying verbal nouns, they may encode [[Ergative-absolutive language|the direct object of a transitive verbal noun and the subject of an intransitive verbal noun]]. Unlike genitive modifiers, they are placed before the modified noun. They do not inflect for case and are immune to any word-initial mutation. However, ''mo'' \"my\" and ''do'' \"your (singular)\" lose their {{IPA|/o/}} in front of a word beginning with a vowel. The initial consonant of ''do'' is also devoiced in this situation to {{IPA|/t/}} and may also be optionally lenited after that to {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish possessive pronouns\n! colspan=2| !!

Suffixed pronouns also denote direct objects, but are instead exclusive to the third-person singular absolute forms of simple verbs. They cause mandatory syncope of the vowel in front of the voiced dental fricative ''d'' that serves as the absolute third-person singular ending, as well as devoicing that consonant termination to ''th''. For example, ''caraid'' \"she loves\" suffixed with the suffixed pronoun ''-i'' \"him\" creates ''carthai'' \"she loves him\", exhibiting the pronouns' signature syncope and devoicing.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish suffixed direct object pronouns\n! colspan=2| !!

This suffixed pronoun took on the form ''-it''. Its vowel suppressed the final vowels of the former two endings and syncopated the vowel of the third.\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Irish has [[Verb-subject-object|VSO]] [[word order]] shared by most [[Insular Celtic languages]]. Other orders are possible, especially under [[Bergin's Law]].  Verbs are all fully [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] and have most forms typical of [[Indo-European languages]]. Personal pronouns, when used as direct objects, are prefixed to the verb with which they are associated (after other prefixes, and therefore are often referred to as infixes). Prepositions have the same status as the Latin prepositions, including the property of being verb prefixes.\n\n===Relative clauses===\n[[Relative clause|Relative clauses]] in Old Irish are indicated via multiple mutually exclusive strategies. No relative pronouns are used, instead favoring mutations of verbs. The modified noun always precedes the verb beginning its associated relative clause.\n\nA leniting relative clause, with the preceding noun serving as its subject, lenites the initial consonant of a deuterotonic form of a verb, inflected appropriately for person and number. If no such form deuterotonic form already exists (such as if a verb is simplex), the dummy particle ''no'' is used with the simplex's conjunct forms to create the deuterotonic form. For example, {{lang|sga|Do\u00b7ceir in fer}} (\"the man fell\") could make a relative phrase {{lang|sga|in fer do\u00b7cheir}} (\"the man who fell\") by placing the subject {{lang|sga|in fer}} (\"man\") in front of the verb and leniting the initial stressed consonant of the verb {{lang|sga|do\u00b7ceir}} (\"fell\"). \n\nIf the object is the antecedent of the relative clause, lenition is not necessary.\n\nSimplex verbs in the third person and in the first person plural have special relative forms. For instance, from {{lang|sga|Caraid in fer mo fiair}} \"the man loves my sister\" can be made a relative clause {{lang|sga|In fer caras mo fiair}} \"the man who loves my sister\". Unlike the leniting relative construction, the antecedent can always be either the subject or the object of the relative verb, so that there could also be {{lang|sga|In fer caras mo fiur}} \"the man my sister loves\".\n\n===Emphasis===\nOld Irish does not rely on intonation changes to relay emphasis, unlike English. Instead, a set of particles are suffixed onto words to emphasize a given element of the sentence. The particles can be attached to verbs and nouns alike. The emphatic suffixes vary by person and number, but contain major syncretism in the third person; the emphatic suffixes for the third person masculine and neuter singular in addition to the third-person plural are identical. The emphatic suffixes are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Emphatic particles in Old Irish\n! Person and number !! Broad form !! Slender form\n|-\n! 1st sing\n| {{lang|sga|-sa}}\n| {{lang|sga|-sea, -se}}\n|-\n! 2nd sing\n| {{lang|sga|-so, -su}}\n| {{lang|sga|-siu}}\n|-\n! 3rd sing masc.\n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{lang|sga|-som, -sam}} \n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{lang|sga|-sem, -sium, -seom}}\n|-\n! 3rd sing neut.\n|-\n! 3rd sing fem.\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| {{lang|sga|-si}}\n|-\n! 1st pl\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| {{lang|sga|-ni}}\n|-\n! 2nd pl\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| {{lang|sga|-si}}\n|-\n! 3rd pl\n| {{lang|sga|-som, -sam}} \n| {{lang|sga|-sem, -sium, -seom}}\n|-\n|}\n\nOn verbs, they can be used to emphasize the subject or object of a verb when they are encoded within its conjugation or infixed pronoun.\n* {{lang|sga|Rom\u00b7ch\u00faalae-sa.}} \"She had heard ''me''.\" (''-sa'' emphasizing who the woman heard \u2014 the speaker)\n* {{lang|sga|Rom\u00b7ch\u00faalae-si.}} \"''She'' had heard me.\" (''-si'' emphasizing who heard the speaker \u2014 the woman).\n\nThe emphatic particles can also emphasize conjugated prepositions. \n* {{lang|sga|Don\u00b7ratsat a b\u00edad nd\u00fan-ni.}} \"They had given ''us'' the food.\" (''-ni'' emphasizes that the food was given to the speaker's group and not to, say, the dogs)\n\nThey can also emphasize possessive pronouns indirectly by being suffixed after the possessed object, since possessive pronouns go unstressed.\n* {{lang|sga|N\u00ed mo ch\u00fa-sa.}} \"It's not ''my'' dog.\" (''-sa'' emphasizes that the speaker in particular isn't the owner, but rather a different person is)\n\nAnother strategy for emphasis is to front the emphasized element into a copular clause, and convert the remainder of the sentence into a relative clause. Take for example the basic sentence {{lang|sga|Marbais fer mo charait}} \"a man killed my friend\". Copular emphasis can create:\n* {{lang|sga|Is fer marbas mo charait.}} (emphasizes who killed the speaker's friend \u2014 a man)\n* {{lang|sga|Is mo charae marbas fer.}} (emphasizes who the man killed \u2014 the speaker's friend)\n* {{lang|sga|Is marbad mo charat do\u00b7gn\u00ed in fer.}} (emphasizes what the man did to the speaker's friend \u2014 kill them.)\n\n===Verbal nouns===\nGenitive and possessive modifiers of verbal nouns exhibit behaviour analogous with that of an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language]]. Genitive modifiers indicate the ''object'' of a transitive verbal noun, with the transitive subject instead being indicated by a prepositional phrase (generally based on prepositions ''do'' or ''la''). On the other hand, intransitive verbs do indeed allow genitive modifiers to indicate their subject.\n* {{lang|sga|a nd\u00edgal}} \"avenging them\" (the possessive pronoun ''a'' indicates the third-person plural object of ''d\u00edgal'', the verbal noun of ''do\u00b7fich'' \"to avenge\")\n* {{lang|sga|a nd\u00edgal dom}} \"my avenging of them\" (adding a conjugated pronominal phrase ''dom'' to indicate the subject of the verbal noun)\n* {{lang|sga|a riuth}} \"their running\" (''a'' in this case indicates the subject of ''riuth'', verbal noun of ''reithid'' \"to run\")\n\nPreceding the verbal noun by ''oc'' \"at\" and the appropriate conjugation of the verb ''at\u00b7t\u00e1'' \"to be\" indicates [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]].\n* {{lang|sga|At\u00b7t\u00f3 oc ithi b\u00edid.}} \"I'm eating food.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2|group=*}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Grammars of specific languages]]\n[[Category:Old Irish|Grammar]]\n", "text_old": "This article describes the grammar of the [[Old Irish]] language.\n\n==Grammatical processes==\n\n===Initial mutations===\n\nIn the system of initial consonant mutations, the initial consonant of a word is modified in one or another way, depending on the nature of the preceding word: ''la tech'' {{IPA|/la t\u02b2ex/}} \"towards a house\" vs. ''fo thech'' {{IPA|/fo \u03b8\u02b2ex/}} \"under a house\", ''i tech'' {{IPA|/i d\u02b2ex/}} \"into a house\", with the alternation {{IPA|/t ~ \u03b8 ~ d/}} in the initial consonant of ''tech'' \"house\" triggered by the preceding preposition.\n\nThere are three types of mutation: \n* Lenition, a weakening of the initial consonant. This generally turns plosives into fricatives, among other effects.\n* Nasalisation, originally a prepending of a nasal consonant to the word, which caused further changes.\n* Aspiration and gemination, causing either gemination of the initial consonant, or the insertion of {{IPA|/h/}}.\n\nThe mutations became an important part of the grammar and remain, with little change, in Modern Irish (see [[Irish initial mutations]]). They were often crucial in distinguishing various grammatical forms, which would be homophones if not for the mutations. For example, in the case of the possessive determiner ''a'', only the initial mutation of the following word distinguishes the meanings \"his\", \"her\", and \"their\":\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Meanings distinguished by initial mutations\n!

(Note that the spelling of the initial consonant does not always change to indicate mutation in Old Irish although it generally does starting in Middle Irish).\n\nInitial mutations were originally [[sandhi]] effects, and depended on the shape of the original final syllable in Primitive Irish. It was grammaticalised by the loss of final syllables in the transition from Primitive Irish to Old Irish. In Old Irish, the process was already grammatical to a large degree, and was limited to applying across words within a single syntactic phrase (e.g. between a noun and a modifying adjective, or between a preposition and the rest of the prepositional phrase). Initial mutations did not apply across phrase boundaries generally, but there are some instances where this does occur in the earliest Old Irish attestations.\n\n====Lenition====\n\nLenition is the weakening of a consonant according to a particular pattern. It applied to consonants appearing between vowels in Primitive Irish. When a preceding word ended in a vowel, the first consonant of the following word was lenited.\n\nLenition was not indicated in the spelling except in the case of initial voiceless stops, which were written ''ph th ch'' when lenited. In later Old Irish, initial ''f s'' come to be written ''\u1e1f \u1e61'' when lenited, with a dot (a so-called ''punctum delens'') above the letter.\n\nLenition occurs after:\n* Certain case forms within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive. These include, at least:\n** Nominative and vocative singular of all feminines\n** Dative singular of all genders\n** Nominative, vocative, accusative and genitive dual of all masculines and feminines\n** Nominative, vocative and accusative plural of all neuters (but inconsistently after ''-a'')\n* Certain prepositions\n* Certain conjunctions\n* Certain infixed pronouns\n\n====Nasalisation====\n\nNasalisation, also known as eclipsis in Modern Irish grammar, is the prepending of a nasal consonant to the word. It was caused by a preceding word ending in a nasal consonant. Due to later changes involving clusters of nasals and other consonants, in particular the coalescing of nasal-stop clusters to voiceless plosives (such as {{IPA|/nt/}} > {{IPA|/d/}}), nasalisation may also manifest itself as voicing in Old Irish.\n\nNasalisation was not indicated in the spelling except for initial voiced stops and vowels, where ''n-'' is prefixed (''m-'' before ''b'').\n\nNasalisation occurs after:\n* Certain case forms within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive. These include, at least:\n** Nominative, vocative and accusative singular and dual of all neuters\n** Accusative singular of all masculines and feminines\n** Genitive plural of all genders\n* Certain prepositions\n* Certain conjunctions\n* Certain infixed pronouns\n\n====Aspiration and gemination====\n\nOriginally two different effects, aspiration and gemination came to be triggered in the same environments and thus can be treated as one type of mutation.\n\nAspiration involved prepending an additional {{IPA|/h/}} to a vowel-initial word. It was primarily caused by syllables formerly ending in {{IPA|/s/}}, which lenited to {{IPA|/h/}} between vowels. In gemination, an initial consonant was geminated by a preceding word originally ending in {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}} after a vowel. By analogy, words originally ending in {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} came to aspiration before vowel-initial words as well.\n\nGemination was only occasionally indicated, and as geminated consonants were in the process of reducing to single consonants in Old Irish times, the mutation effect itself was waning. Aspiration was not indicated at all.\n\nAspiration/gemination occurs after:\n* Within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive, all forms that end in a vowel but do not trigger lenition or nasalisation. This includes, at least:\n** Genitive singular of all feminines\n** Vocative and accusative plural of all genders\n* Certain prepositions\n* ''n\u00ed'' and ''ba''\n\n===Palatalisation===\n\nPalatalisation as such is phonological, but it also has a grammatical aspect to it. Certain case forms of nouns automatically trigger palatalisation of the final consonant of a word, as do forms of verbs. Consequently, the quality of the final consonant can often vary between different forms of the same word.\n\nPalatalisation also occurs when a syllable that originally contained a front vowel undergoes syncope. Since Old Irish generalised the palatal or nonpalatal quality across an entire consonant cluster, when the front vowel was lost, the palatalisation of the preceding consonants \"extended\" to the entire resulting consonant cluster, consisting of both the consonants before the syncopated vowel and the consonants after it. This could lead to alternations between palatalisation in the syncopated forms and nonpalatalisation in the unsyncopated forms of a word. For example, the noun ''dorus'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dorus/}} \"door\" originally had a front vowel ''e'' in the second syllable (Proto-Celtic ''*dworestu''), but this did not cause palatalisation due to the u-affection of the final vowel. However, when the noun was syncopated in certain case forms, the palatalisation reappeared and spread also to the final ''s'', seen in the genitive singular ''doirseo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dor\u02b2s\u02b2o/}} and dative plural ''doirsib'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dor\u02b2s\u02b2\u0259v\u02b2/}}.\n\nPalatalisation can sometimes affect the immediately preceding vowel:\n* ''\u00eda'' \u2192 ''\u00e9''.\n* ''\u00e1e'', ''\u00f3e'' \u2192 ''a\u00ed'', ''o\u00ed''. This is purely an orthographical distinction, and is not adhered to strongly in the manuscripts. It's used more often in normalised spellings for clarity.\n\n===Vowel affection===\n\nVowel affection is the changing of the height of a vowel to more closely match the height of the vowel in a following syllable. It is similar to [[Germanic umlaut]], but more pervasive. It was originally a relatively automatic process, but because the final vowels were later mostly lost in the transition to Old Irish, the process became unpredictable and grammaticalised. Three different kinds of vowel affection existed in Old Irish, ''lowering'', ''raising'' and ''u-insertion''.\n\n'''Lowering''' was caused by a (former) low vowel ''a'' or ''o'' in the following syllable, and affected the underlying short vowels ''i'' and ''u'', changing them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively. It occurred regardless of the preceding consonants, and was thus rather common.\n\n'''Raising''' was the reverse development: when followed by a (former) high vowel, short ''i'' or ''u'', in the following syllable, the vowels ''e'' and ''o'' were changed to ''i'' and ''u''. It did not occur in all cases, as it was limited by the intervening consonants. It occurred only when at most one consonant stood between the syllables, and the consonant had to be voiced (this included sonorants). Thus, while the noun ''cenn'' {{IPA|/k\u02b2eN/}} was raised to ''cinn'' {{IPA|/k\u02b2iN\u02b2/}} in the genitive singular form (along with palatalisation), ''ech'' {{IPA|/ex/}} was not raised and retained its original vowel in its genitive singular form ''eich'' {{IPA|/ex\u02b2/}}.\n\nThe underlying vowel of a word remained when the vowel ''e'' formerly followed. For example, in masculine o-stems, the vocative singular form had ''e'' in the ending, but the other forms had other vowels which caused either raising or lowering. In neuter o-stems, ''all'' forms had raising or lowering endings, none originally contained ''e''. This can make it difficult to ascertain what the original underlying vowel was.\n\n'''U-insertion''' was a third effect, caused by a (formerly) following ''u''. It involved inserting the vowel ''u'' (or ''o'', as an orthographic variant) after an existing vowel, and occurred with the long vowel ''\u00e9'' and the short vowels ''a'', ''e'' and ''i''. The results were as follows:\n* ''a'' \u2192 ''au''.\n* ''e'' \u2192 ''iu'' if raising can take place, ''eu''/''eo'' otherwise.\n* ''i'' \u2192 ''iu''.\n* ''\u00e9'' \u2192 ''\u00e9u''/''\u00e9o'', sometimes also ''\u00edu''.\nU-insertion did not necessarily occur in all cases where it might be expected, in particular when the ''u'' that might cause the effect was still present. For example, the accusative plural of ''ech'' may be ''euchu''/''eochu'', but ''echu'' is also found, lacking u-insertion. For ''fer'', the accusative plural is ''firu'', never ''*fiuru''.\n\n==Nouns==\nOld Irish has 3 [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter; 3 [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and [[plural]]; and 5 [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative]]. The dual is predominantly preceded by the [[cardinal number]] {{lang|sga|d\u00e1}} \"two\".\nThe full range of forms is only evident in the noun phrase, where the article causes noun initial mutation, and where the initials of following adjectives are mutated according to the underlying case ending, though at times such mutations were not written. In the following, L shows lenition, N shows nasalisation, and H shows aspiration/gemination. In addition, there was some [[syncretism]] in forms regardless of mutations: certain forms were always identical. These were:\n* Nominative/vocative/accusative of all neuter nouns in all numbers.\n* Nominative/vocative/accusative dual of all nouns.\n* Vocative/accusative plural of all nouns.\n* Dative dual/plural of all nouns.\n\n===o-stems===\n\nThe o-stems could be masculine or neuter, and were the most widespread kind of noun, thus this class is well attested. They descend from the Proto-Indo-European thematic inflection. They are characterized by a genitive singular formed by palatalizing the final consonant of the word. Some monosyllables may have their root vowel ''e'' or ''o'' raised to ''i'' or ''u'' respectively when forming the genitive singular. Additionally, their dative singular forms are a constant target for u-infection.\n\nThe masculine o-stems' nominative plurals were identical to their genitive singulars and had an accusative plural ending in ''-u''. The accusative plural tended to trigger vowel raising, syncope of multisyllabic words, and occasionally u-infection.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Masculine o-stems\n! rowspan=2|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|fer}} (\"man\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|sorn}} (\"furnace, oven\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|claideb}} (\"sword\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|ball}} (\"part\")\n|-\n!

Feminine u-stem nouns had originally existed, but they had all been converted into \u0101-stems by the time Old Irish was written. The major difference between u-stems and i-stems were that the nominative singular and its homophones always ended in an unpalatalized consonant, when the opposite was true of the i-stems. None of the endings triggered palatalisation by themselves. However, palatalisation did occur when a syllable (formerly) containing a front vowel was contracted; the front vowel itself would then be erased by a u-infection in the inflections that did not involve this syncope.\n\nThe masculine u-stem nominative plural was often in flux, and attestations varied wildly in its form, with endings in ''-e'', ''-a'', and ''-i'' all being attested.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Masculine u-stems\n! rowspan=2|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|guth}} (\"voice, sound\") !!rowspan=7|\n! colspan=3| {{lang|sga|ammus}} (\"attempt\")\n|-\n!

Demonstrative adjectives have proximal, medial, and distal forms.\n\n==Verbs==\nVerbs stand initially in the sentence (preceded only by some particles, forming a \"verbal complex\", and very few adverbs). The verb can be either suffixed for tense, person, mood and aspect (often portmanteau suffixes), or these can be shown by vowel changes in the stem (e.g. {{lang|sga|as\u00b7b'''ei'''r}} present \"says\", {{lang|sga|as\u00b7rub'''a'''rt}} past \"said\", {{lang|sga|as\u00b7b'''\u00e9'''ra}} future \"will say\").  Before this core \"verb phrase\" are placed various other preverbal [[clitic]] particles, e.g. negative ''ni-/n\u00ed-'', perfective ''ro-'' or one or more preverbal particles that add meaning of the verb stem (compare {{lang|la|\u0101-}}, {{lang|la|ex-}}, {{lang|la|in-}}, {{lang|la|d\u0113-}}, etc. in Latin verbs). Personal pronouns as direct objects are infixed between the preverb and the verbal stem. In an overall sense, the verb structure is agglutinative. A single verb can stand as an entire sentence in Old Irish, in which case emphatic particles such as {{lang|sga|-sa}} and {{lang|sga|-se}} are affixed to the end of the verb.\n\nVerbs are conjugated in [[present tense|present]], [[imperfect]], [[past tense|past]], [[future tense|future]] and [[preterite]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]; indicative, [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]] [[grammatical mood|moods]]; and active and passive [[Grammatical voice|voices]]. The only verbal form lacking in Old Irish is the [[infinitive]], this covered, as in the modern Gaelic languages, by the verbal noun.  Old Irish inherits a large amount of [[Proto-Indo-European verbs|Indo-European verbal morphology]], including:\n\n* extensive [[ablaut]] variations, made significantly more complicated by vowel affection and syncope\n* [[reduplication]]\n* primary and secondary endings\n* [[thematic vowel|thematic and athematic endings]]\n* [[deponent verb]]s\n* multiple ways of forming each of the various tenses and moods, and no general cross-tense/mood [[grammatical conjugation|conjugational classes]], i.e. in general a series of [[principal part]]s must be memorised for each verb, much as in [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]].\n* ''n''-infix verbs\n\n===Independent and dependent forms===\n\nMost verbs have, in addition to the tenses, voices, and moods named above, two sets of forms: [[Dependent and independent verb forms|an independent and a dependent conjugation]]. The independent conjugation occurs when the verb occurs absolutely sentence-initial with no preverbs, while the dependent conjugation occurs when the verb is preceded by one or more preverbs. The formation of the independent and dependent conjugations depends on whether a verb is '''simple''' or '''complex'''. A complex verb is a verb that is always combined with a preverb, while all other verbs are simple verbs. The dependent conjugation of a simple verb is essentially the same as the independent conjugation of a complex verb, though different terminology is used:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Independent\n! Dependent\n|-\n! Simple verb\n| Absolute inflection\n| Conjunct inflection\n|-\n! Complex verb\n| Deuterotonic inflection\n| Prototonic inflection\n|}\n\nThe absolute and conjunct inflections are distinguished primarily by the endings, e.g. ''biru'' \"I carry\", ''berid'' \"he carries\" vs. ''n\u00ed-biur'' \"I do not carry\", ''n\u00ed-beir'' \"he does not carry\" (with negative prefix ''n\u00ed-''). The difference between absolute and conjunct endings is thought to reflect an additional particle ''*-es'' added to the absolute verbal form.{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=363}} Final ''-i'' in the conjunct forms was apparently lost early on (cf. a similar change in Latin).\n\nThe difference between deuterotonic and prototonic inflections involves a stress shift. The stress is always placed on the second preverb from the beginning, due to the Celtic version of [[Wackernagel's law]]. Consequently, when a preverb is attached to a verb that already has one, the stress shifts one preverb to the left. This stress shift is accompanied by (sometimes radical) changes in the verbal stem and all but the first preverbal particle(s), which merge with the stem, e.g. ''do\u22c5berat'' \"they bring/give\", ''as\u22c5berat'' \"they say\" vs. ''n\u00ed-taibret'' \"they do not bring/give\", ''n\u00ed-epret'' \"they do not say\". In the ''s''-subjunctive, the allomorphy is even more extreme, especially in the third-person singular: indicative ''as\u22c5boind'' \"he refuses\" vs. ''n\u00ed\u22c5opaind'' \"he does not refuse\", subjunctive ''as\u22c5b\u00f3'' \"he may refuse\" vs. ''n\u00ed\u22c5op'' \"he may not refuse\". In many cases, from a [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] perspective, the changes appear utterly random (''do\u22c5r\u00f3sc(a)i'' \"he surpasses\" vs. ''n\u00ed-derscaigi'' \"he does not surpass\") or even unrecognisable (''imm\u22c5so\u00ed'' \"he turns around\" vs. ''n\u00ed-impa\u00ed'' \"he does not turn around\"). However, the forms usually result from a series of regular [[sound change]]s.<ref group=*>Primitive Irish *di-s-<u>ro</u>-uss-skok\u012bt vs. *n\u012b-s-<u>di</u>-ro-uss-skok\u012bt, *embi-s-<u>sa</u>wet vs. *n\u012b-s-<u>em</u>bi-sawet, with the stressed syllable underlined.</ref> A few verbs form their prototonic forms irregularly. Two verbs beginning with the prefix ''ro-'', ''ro\u00b7cluinethar'' (\"to hear\") and ''ro\u00b7finnadar'' form their prototonic forms by solely deleting the prefix without any stem change. Two other verbs, ''fo\u00b7ceird'' (\"to put\" or \"to throw\") and ''do\u00b7bidci'' (\"to shoot, hurl\") use [[suppletion]] to create their prototonic forms.\n\n===Classification===\n\nTwo main classifications of Old Irish verbs exist, both based on the formation of the present indicative: the Thurneysen classification and the McCone classification. Both systems classify verbs broadly between weak and strong, the distinction being that weak verbs have a 3rd person singular conjunct form ending in a vowel, while strong verbs have a 3rd person singular conjunct form ending in a consonant. This distinction, like the strong-weak distinction found in the [[Germanic languages]], reflects the PIE split between primary and secondary verbs. McCone's system additionally has a separate class for so-called \"hiatus\" verbs, in which the root itself ends in a vowel rather than the verb having a vocalic suffix, as in the \"true\" weak verbs.

These are:\n* Present stem: forms the present and imperfect indicative, and the imperative.\n* Subjunctive stem: forms the present and past subjunctive\n* Future stem: forms the future\n* Preterite active stem: forms the active preterite forms\n* Preterite passive stem: forms the passive preterite forms\n\n===Reduplication===\n\nReduplication in Old Irish verbal conjugation tends to happen in the formation of s-futures, a-futures and reduplicated preterites, especially in strong verbs.\n\n* In reduplicated preterites, the first syllable of the reduplicated root consists of the first root-initial consonant followed by /e/. The following syllable would begin with the root-initial consonants (that were not previously deleted) followed by ''a'' and then the root-final consonant. No endings were added in the first and second person singular forms. In the third-person singular, the root-final consonant was always slender, while the plural forms had endings.\n* In s-futures and a-futures, the first syllable's vowel was instead often /i/, which may be lowered by a-affection to /e/.\n\nHowever, due to various historical phonetic deletions, the reduplication may not be obvious, and in some cases the reduplication of one verb would be analogically extended to other verbs that did not reduplicate similarly. For example, ''sligid'' \"strikes down\" has a reduplicated preterite ''selaig'' \"struck down\" and an s-future ''silis'' \"will strike down\", with a lost reduplicated ''s'' formerly in front of the ''l'' in both paradigms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Reduplicated conjugations in Old Irish verbs <br/> (all conjugations are in the third person singular absolute or deuterotonic unless noted)\n!

Reduplicating ''*k'' in the middle of the word was then lost, causing [[compensatory lengthening]]. Long ''o'' proceeded to break into a diphthong.

Such prefixes are called '''augments'''. Perfective augmentation is generally performed on the preterite indicative, creating perfect-aspect forms, while potential augmentation is applied to subjunctive forms. Both augmentations may be done albeit much less commonly on the present indicative, and rarely appear elsewhere.\n\nThe vast majority of verbs use ''ro-'' as their augment. However, there are several major exceptions to using ''ro-''. \n\n* Verbs formed with prefixed ''com-'' (or its allomorph ''con-'') usually use ''ad-'' as their augment.\n* Some irregularly distributed compound verbs use ''com-'' as its augment.\n* ''ibid'' (\"to drink\") uses ''ess-''.\n* ''saidid'' (\"to sit\") and ''laigid'' (\"to lie (down, etc.)\") combine ''d\u00ed-'' and ''in-'' to form their augments.\n* ''tongaid'' (\"to swear\") combines ''to-'' and ''com-'' to create its augment.\n* ''mligid'' (\"to milk\") combines ''to-'' and ''uss-'' to make its augment.\n* Some verbs supplete an unrelated verb stem entirely to serve as their augmented forms.\n\nFurthermore, some verbs are prohibited from using augments entirely.\n\n===Subjunctive stem types===\n\nThe subjunctive comes in three variants, all continuing the PIE ''s''-aorist subjunctive.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Type\n!

The endings are partly athematic, especially the 3rd singular, with original suffix ''*-s-t'' that leads to truncation of the root: cf. ''as\u00b7boind'' \"he refuses\" < {{IPA|*uss-\u02c8bond-et}}, prototonic ''\u00b7op(a)ind'' < {{IPA|*\u02c8uss-bond-et}}; subj.

The *-n- is a present-tense infix (cf. the cognate [[Ancient Greek]] verb ''punth\u00e1nomai'' \"I inquire\", [[aorist]] ''eputh\u00f3m\u0113n'' \"I inquired\").</ref>\n\nIn the ''e''-subjunctive, the root-final vowel ''i'' of a suitable hiatus verb is transformed into ''e'' in the subjunctive and is followed directly by a personal ending with neither ''-s-'' nor ''-a-'' being additionally suffixed in between.\n\nThe below table, comparing the conjugations of the ''a''- and ''s-''subjunctives, uses ''beirid'' \"to carry\" and ''do\u00b7beir'' (prototonic ''\u00b7tabair'') \"to give, bring\" as examples of ''a''-subjunctive formation while ''t\u00e9it'' \"to go\" and ''at\u00b7reig'' \"to rise\" serve as examples of ''s''-subjunctive formations. For ''e''-subjunctive formations, these are sparsely attested outside of the very common verbs {{lang|sga|at\u00b7t\u00e1}} \"to be\" and {{lang|sga|do\u00b7gn\u00ed}} \"to do\", and go unused in the prototonic forms of compounds, where ''a''-subjunctives are used instead.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comparison of subjunctive conjugation classes\n! rowspan=3| !! colspan=3| ''a''-subjunctive !! colspan=3| ''s''-subjunctive !! colspan=3| ''e''-subjunctive\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Absolute !! colspan=2|Conjunct !! rowspan=2|Absolute !! colspan=2|Conjunct !! rowspan=2|Absolute !!

The copula remains in its third-person singular forms regardless the person and number of the independent pronoun, with the exception of the third-person plural, which forces the copula into its third-person plural forms.\n\nHowever, in the modern Goidelic languages they have become much more common, even for non-emphatic purposes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish independent personal pronouns\n! colspan=2| !!

These serve as direct object pronouns and are always attached onto the preverb preceding the stressed portion of a deuterotonic verbal complex. If a deuterotonic formation does not exist by default (due to the verb being simple in the first place), the preverb ''no'' is used with the conjunct forms of the simple verb to concoct a deuterotonic form.\n\nThe infixed pronouns belong to three classes, conventionally labelled A, B, and C. The three classes vary by the phonological context of the preverb (classes A and B) or syntactical context of the clause containing it (Class C vs. Classes A and B).\n* Class A pronouns are used after preverbs that historically ended in vowels, such as ''do-'' (preverbal form of ''to-'' and ''d\u00ed-''), ''ro-'', ''fo-'', ''no-'', ''imm-'', and ''ar-''. They are also used after the verbal negation particle ''n\u00ed''. For ''imm-'' and ''ar-'', a vowel was used to link the preverb and the Class A pronoun. This vowel was overall random but tended to be ''-u-''.\n* Class B pronouns are used after preverbs historically ending in consonants. They are characterized by starting with /d/, spelled as ''t'' or ''d'' (the forms beginning with ''t'' in the below table can also be sometimes spelled with ''d'') and their irregular fusions with their preverbs.\n* Class C pronouns are used with verbs within a nasalized subordinate clause. They all contain a voiced dental fricative /\u00f0/, spelled ''d''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish infixed direct object pronouns\n! colspan=2| !! Class A !! Class B !!

On the other hand, it is itself suppressed by the negative particle ''n\u00ed'' \"does not\", leaving only mutational effects behind.\n* Class B pronouns replace the final consonant of all their preverbs except ''etar-'' and ''for-''. They also irregularly merge ''in-'' with ''ad-'' when attached.\n* Class C pronouns in the third-person singular masculine and neuter are further subdivided based on either phonological context or the particle preceding the verb.\n** ''-d'' appears where the Class A pronoun would otherwise be used.\n** ''-id'' appears where the  Class B pronoun would otherwise be used.\n** ''-did'' when the clause is preceded by ''i'' \"into which\" or ''co'' \"so that\".\n\n===Possessive pronouns===\nPossessive pronouns in Old Irish, as expected, have genitive function. Additionally, when modifying verbal nouns, they may encode [[Ergative-absolutive language|the direct object of a transitive verbal noun and the subject of an intransitive verbal noun]]. Unlike genitive modifiers, they are placed before the modified noun. They do not inflect for case and are immune to any word-initial mutation. However, ''mo'' \"my\" and ''do'' \"your (singular)\" lose their {{IPA|/o/}} in front of a word beginning with a vowel. The initial consonant of ''do'' is also devoiced in this situation to {{IPA|/t/}} and may also be optionally lenited after that to {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish possessive pronouns\n! colspan=2| !!

Suffixed pronouns also denote direct objects, but are instead exclusive to the third-person singular absolute forms of simple verbs. They cause mandatory syncope of the vowel in front of the voiced dental fricative ''d'' that serves as the absolute third-person singular ending, as well as devoicing that consonant termination to ''th''. For example, ''caraid'' \"she loves\" suffixed with the suffixed pronoun ''-i'' \"him\" creates ''carthai'' \"she loves him\", exhibiting the pronouns' signature syncope and devoicing.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Old Irish suffixed direct object pronouns\n! colspan=2| !! Pronoun\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| 1st sing \n| {{lang|sga|-um}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| 2nd sing \n| {{lang|sga|-ut}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 3rd sing\n! masc. \n| {{lang|sga|-i}}\n|-\n! fem. \n| {{lang|sga|-us}}\n|-\n! neut. \n| {{lang|sga|-i}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| 1st pl \n| {{lang|sga|-unn}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| 2nd pl \n| {{lang|sga|-uib}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| 3rd pl \n| {{lang|sga|-us}}\n|}\n\nThere also existed a masculine or neuter suffixed pronoun that can be instead attached to absolute simple verbs' first-person singular future forms in ''-(e)a'', first-person plural forms ending in ''-m(a)i'', and third-person plural forms in ''-(a)it''. This suffixed pronoun took on the form ''-it''. Its vowel suppressed the final vowels of the former two endings and syncopated the vowel of the third.\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Irish has [[Verb-subject-object|VSO]] [[word order]] shared by most [[Insular Celtic languages]]. Other orders are possible, especially under [[Bergin's Law]].  Verbs are all fully [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] and have most forms typical of [[Indo-European languages]]. Personal pronouns, when used as direct objects, are prefixed to the verb with which they are associated (after other prefixes, and therefore are often referred to as infixes). Prepositions have the same status as the Latin prepositions, including the property of being verb prefixes.\n\n===Relative clauses===\n[[Relative clause|Relative clauses]] in Old Irish are indicated via multiple mutually exclusive strategies. No relative pronouns are used, instead favoring mutations of verbs. The modified noun always precedes the verb beginning its associated relative clause.\n\nA leniting relative clause, with the preceding noun serving as its subject, lenites the initial consonant of a deuterotonic form of a verb, inflected appropriately for person and number. If no such form deuterotonic form already exists (such as if a verb is simplex), the dummy particle ''no'' is used with the simplex's conjunct forms to create the deuterotonic form. For example, {{lang|sga|Do\u00b7ceir in fer}} (\"the man fell\") could make a relative phrase {{lang|sga|in fer do\u00b7cheir}} (\"the man who fell\") by placing the subject {{lang|sga|in fer}} (\"man\") in front of the verb and leniting the initial stressed consonant of the verb {{lang|sga|do\u00b7ceir}} (\"fell\"). \n\nIf the object is the antecedent of the relative clause, lenition is not necessary.\n\nSimplex verbs in the third person and in the first person plural have special relative forms. For instance, from {{lang|sga|Caraid in fer mo fiair}} \"the man loves my sister\" can be made a relative clause {{lang|sga|In fer caras mo fiair}} \"the man who loves my sister\". Unlike the leniting relative construction, the antecedent can always be either the subject or the object of the relative verb, so that there could also be {{lang|sga|In fer caras mo fiur}} \"the man my sister loves\".\n\n===Emphasis===\nOld Irish does not rely on intonation changes to relay emphasis, unlike English. Instead, a set of particles are suffixed onto words to emphasize a given element of the sentence. The particles can be attached to verbs and nouns alike. The emphatic suffixes vary by person and number, but contain major syncretism in the third person; the emphatic suffixes for the third person masculine and neuter singular in addition to the third-person plural are identical. The emphatic suffixes are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Emphatic particles in Old Irish\n! Person and number !! Broad form !! Slender form\n|-\n! 1st sing\n| {{lang|sga|-sa}}\n| {{lang|sga|-sea, -se}}\n|-\n! 2nd sing\n| {{lang|sga|-so, -su}}\n| {{lang|sga|-siu}}\n|-\n! 3rd sing masc.\n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{lang|sga|-som, -sam}} \n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{lang|sga|-sem, -sium, -seom}}\n|-\n! 3rd sing neut.\n|-\n! 3rd sing fem.\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| {{lang|sga|-si}}\n|-\n! 1st pl\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| {{lang|sga|-ni}}\n|-\n! 2nd pl\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| {{lang|sga|-si}}\n|-\n! 3rd pl\n| {{lang|sga|-som, -sam}} \n| {{lang|sga|-sem, -sium, -seom}}\n|-\n|}\n\nOn verbs, they can be used to emphasize the subject or object of a verb when they are encoded within its conjugation or infixed pronoun.\n* {{lang|sga|Rom\u00b7ch\u00faalae-sa.}} \"She had heard ''me''.\" (''-sa'' emphasizing who the woman heard \u2014 the speaker)\n* {{lang|sga|Rom\u00b7ch\u00faalae-si.}} \"''She'' had heard me.\" (''-si'' emphasizing who heard the speaker \u2014 the woman).\n\nThe emphatic particles can also emphasize conjugated prepositions. \n* {{lang|sga|Don\u00b7ratsat a b\u00edad nd\u00fan-ni.}} \"They had given ''us'' the food.\" (''-ni'' emphasizes that the food was given to the speaker's group and not to, say, the dogs)\n\nThey can also emphasize possessive pronouns indirectly by being suffixed after the possessed object, since possessive pronouns go unstressed.\n* {{lang|sga|N\u00ed mo ch\u00fa-sa.}} \"It's not ''my'' dog.\" (''-sa'' emphasizes that the speaker in particular isn't the owner, but rather a different person is)\n\nAnother strategy for emphasis is to front the emphasized element into a copular clause, and convert the remainder of the sentence into a relative clause. Take for example the basic sentence {{lang|sga|Marbais fer mo charait}} \"a man killed my friend\". Copular emphasis can create:\n* {{lang|sga|Is fer marbas mo charait.}} (emphasizes who killed the speaker's friend \u2014 a man)\n* {{lang|sga|Is mo charae marbas fer.}} (emphasizes who the man killed \u2014 the speaker's friend)\n* {{lang|sga|Is marbad mo charat do\u00b7gn\u00ed in fer.}} (emphasizes what the man did to the speaker's friend \u2014 kill them.)\n\n===Verbal nouns===\nGenitive and possessive modifiers of verbal nouns exhibit behaviour analogous with that of an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language]]. Genitive modifiers indicate the ''object'' of a transitive verbal noun, with the transitive subject instead being indicated by a prepositional phrase (generally based on prepositions ''do'' or ''la''). On the other hand, intransitive verbs do indeed allow genitive modifiers to indicate their subject.\n* {{lang|sga|a nd\u00edgal}} \"avenging them\" (the possessive pronoun ''a'' indicates the third-person plural object of ''d\u00edgal'', the verbal noun of ''do\u00b7fich'' \"to avenge\")\n* {{lang|sga|a nd\u00edgal dom}} \"my avenging of them\" (adding a conjugated pronominal phrase ''dom'' to indicate the subject of the verbal noun)\n* {{lang|sga|a riuth}} \"their running\" (''a'' in this case indicates the subject of ''riuth'', verbal noun of ''reithid'' \"to run\")\n\nPreceding the verbal noun by ''oc'' \"at\" and the appropriate conjugation of the verb ''at\u00b7t\u00e1'' \"to be\" indicates [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]].\n* {{lang|sga|At\u00b7t\u00f3 oc ithi b\u00edid.}} \"I'm eating food.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2|group=*}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Grammars of specific languages]]\n[[Category:Old Irish|Grammar]]\n", "name_user": "Mellohi!", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePossessive pronouns", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Irish_grammar"}
