Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The Mu\u1e33addima summarizes the complex rules of Arabic syntax into a concise, clear and intelligible format, that is easy to memorize.

Roberts]]. Like Crittenberger, they were all destined to become [[general officer]]s.\n\n==Between the wars==\nUnable to see service overseas in [[World War I]], where he remained in the United States training recruits, Crittenberger's advanced military education included the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]] in 1924, the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas in 1925 and the [[United States Army War College]] at [[Washington Barracks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1930. After assignments to [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized)]]'s new home in 1934, he served on [[Staff (military)|staff]] positions to the Chief of Cavalry in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and, towards the end of the [[interwar period]], realizing that the cavalry's role in any future conflict would be limited (as World War I and [[trench warfare]] had proved), becoming increasingly interested in [[Armoured warfare|armored warfare]], and became [[chief of staff]] for the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n\n==World War II==\nWith the onset of the United States entry into [[World War II]], Crittenberger, with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], was commanding the [[2nd Armored Brigade (United States)|2nd Armored Brigade]] of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]], under Major General [[George S.

In August 1942, relinquishing command of the 2nd Armored Division to Major General [[Ernest N.

After growing up in [[Anderson, Indiana]], he was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) at [[West Point, New York]] in 1909, graduating four years later on June 12, 1913 with the West Point class of 1913, two years ahead of fellow cadet, friend and infantry officer, [[Dwight D.

Roberts]]. Like Crittenberger, they were all destined to become [[general officer]]s.\n\n==Between the wars==\nUnable to see service overseas in [[World War I]], where he remained in the United States training recruits, Crittenberger's advanced military education included the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]] in 1924, the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas in 1925 and the [[United States Army War College]] at [[Washington Barracks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1930. After assignments to [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized)]]'s new home in 1934, he served on [[Staff (military)|staff]] positions to the Chief of Cavalry in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and, towards the end of the [[interwar period]], realizing that the cavalry's role in any future conflict would be limited (as World War I and [[trench warfare]] had proved), becoming increasingly interested in [[Armoured warfare|armored warfare]], and became [[chief of staff]] for the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n\n==World War II==\nWith the onset of the United States entry into [[World War II]], Crittenberger, with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], was commanding the [[2nd Armored Brigade (United States)|2nd Armored Brigade]] of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]], under Major General [[George S. Patton]]. In February 1942, two months after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 and the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]] four days later, Crittenberger assumed command of the division while Patton was sent to command the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]]. In August 1942, relinquishing command of the 2nd Armored Division to Major General [[Ernest N. Harmon]], Crittenberger, now a major general, organized, trained and commanded the [[XIX Corps (United States)|III Armored Corps]], composed of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th]] and [[11th Armored Division (United States)|11th Armored Division]]s at [[Fort Polk|Camp Polk]], [[Louisiana]].

At this time the [[fictional character]] had already featured in the [[animated series]] ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', a segment on the [[children's television series]] ''[[The Electric Company]]'' (called ''[[Spidey Super Stories]]''), and the [[live action]] [[prime time]] series ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. As a result of the success, Marvel Comics licensed the character into a stream of electronic games.\n\n===Atari 2600===\nIn 1982, [[Parker Brothers]] published a game for the [[Atari 2600]] (and its clone system, the [[Sears Video Arcade]]) titled ''[[Spider-Man (Atari 2600)|Spider-Man]]''. The action game involves climbing a skyscraper, capturing criminals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atariage.com/manual_page.php?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=477&ItemTypeID=&currentPage=3&maxPages=8 |title=AtariAge.com |publisher=AtariAge.com |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> and defusing bombs set by the [[Green Goblin]].

The story of the game is told in a series of comic panels, with the game play similar to that of ''[[Street Fighter]]'': The player, as either [[Captain America]] or Spider-Man, battles villains one-on-one until facing [[Doctor Doom]].\n\nIn December 1989, ''[[The Revenge of Shinobi]]'' was released on the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The game's boss battles feature comic book characters including Spider-Man and Batman, as well as famous movie characters, including Terminator and Godzilla, and even Rambo as normal-stage enemy. Initially, Spider-Man was included without consent from Marvel, but another version was released, this time with the copyright message shown in the beginning of the game, giving credit to Marvel, and editing the looks of Batman, Rambo and Godzilla, so avoiding a possible lawsuit; a [[Sega CD]] version was released, being derived from the altered version.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the 1990s, comics enjoyed a boom, and the early 1990s saw a myriad of [[video games]] based on high-profile comic story lines and the 1994 ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.\n\n===Home computers===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (1990 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was the first game of the decade released, a puzzle oriented action game developed by [[Oxford Digital Enterprises]] and released in 1990 for the Amiga and ported to MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and [[Atari ST]]. The title was published by [[Paragon Software Corporation]] and features over 250 screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/amazing-spider-man |title=Moby Games |publisher=Moby Games |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Game Boy===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (handheld video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', developed by [[Rare (company)|Rareware]] and released in 1990 was the first in a trilogy for the newly introduced [[Game Boy]]. The game was published by [[LJN]] (a subsidiary of [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]]), the first of a series of games published based on licensed Marvel characters. The game play involves running across [[New York City|New York]] chasing supervillains to locate [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spiderman.ugo.com/?cur=video-games |title=UGO.com Spider-Man Game Guide |publisher=Spiderman.ugo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317054430/http://spiderman.ugo.com/?cur=video-games |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (1992 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' was developed by B.I.T.S and released in 1992. The game is a side-scrolling [[beat-'em up]]. Spider-Man attempts to clear his name after he is accused of a crime committed by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].\n\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers|Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers]]'', the third in the series, was released in 1993 by [[B.I.T.S.]].\n\n''[[The Punisher: The Ultimate Payback!]]'' by [[Australia|Australian]] company [[Beam Software]] was released in 1991 for the Game Boy. The game is much like ''[[Operation Wolf]]'', with the Punisher shooting villains while protecting the innocent. Spider-Man appears between the action to offer advice on how to beat upcoming levels and swings in to rescue hostages once their captors have been shot.\n\n===Games for the Sega family of consoles===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]'', developed and published by [[Sega]] and released in 1990, was the first game featuring ''Spider-Man'' on [[Sega]] consoles. The game premiered on the [[Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in 1991, followed by the [[Game Gear]] in 1992, and to the [[Sega CD]] in 1993. Fundamentally, the game is the same on each platform with each iteration including new levels, enhanced graphics and a few incremental improvements to the game play. The story involves Spider-Man trying to collect six keys from six villains to defuse a bomb in New York planted by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Spider-Man has a finite supply of web fluid and the only way to replenish is to take photos, most profitably of the supervillains, to sell to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''.\n\n''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]'' was released in 1991 for coin-operated [[video arcade|arcades]]. Developed by [[Sega]] on [[Sega System 32]] hardware, the game is a four-player, platform beat-'em-up similar to [[Data East]]'s ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]'' released the same year. The player plays as Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], or [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], with the game divided into four acts.\n[[File:Spider-man-nes-game-screenshot.png|thumb|170px|right|The NES game, ''Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six''.]]\n\n===Nintendo Entertainment System===\n''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]'' developed by B.I.T.S. and released in 1992 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was the first game featuring Spider-Man on the NES. It was an action platform game that involved Spider-Man swinging across various levels to defeat each one of the Sinister Six; Electro, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Mysterio]], Hobgoblin, [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and Doctor Octopus. Ports to the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] followed in 1993.\n\n===Genesis and Super NES===\n''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', the first Spider-Man cross platform game, was released on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]]. It was first developed for the [[Super NES]] in 1992 by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] (who went on to produce several games for Marvel) and published by [[LJN]]. The game was later ported to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in 1993. The game involves rescuing four of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhero [[X-Men]] ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]) from an [[assassination|assassin]] named [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. The player must navigate Spider-Man in search of the captured heroes (who join Spider-Man when found), fighting a variety of super villains. Software Creations later adapted the game to the Game Boy in 1993 and to Game Gear in 1994.\n\n''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', released on Super NES and Genesis in 1994, was the first one of two major Marvel comic book storyline adaptations by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]]. ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]'' released in 1995 for Super NES, Genesis and PC was the sequel. Both games are side scrolling beat-'em up action games where the player controls either Spider-Man or Venom, fighting various villains from the comic book plotlines.\n\n''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man]]'' from 1995, was developed by Western Technologies and published by Acclaim on the Genesis, and by [[LJN]] on the Super NES. It marked the beginning of a range of software incorporating elements from the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon. The game is a side scrolling action platformer. The Super NES game features six levels, five bosses, and fourteen sub-bosses. The Genesis game features five levels, five bosses, and thirteen sub-bosses. The game also features the Fantastic Four.\n\n===Super Famicom===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'' was released in 1995 for the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan, very loosely based on the mini-series ''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man''.\n\n===Tiger's LCD games===\nOver the years [[Tiger Electronics]] released several handheld [[LCD]] Spider-Man games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tiger/Spiderman.htm |title=Tiger Spider-Man |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===''Spider-Man Cartoon Maker''===\n''[[Spider-Man Cartoon Maker]]'', released in 1995 by [[Knowledge Adventure]], is a software package that allowed the user to create films by utilizing an archive of backdrops, animations and props from the ''Spider-Man'' animated series. The game featured the voice of [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]], who played Spider-Man in the series.\n\n===''Marvel CD-ROM Comics featuring Spider-Man''===\nThat same year Marvel attempted to release classic comic books onto [[CD-ROM]]. Only four were ever produced, based on Spider-Man, the X-Men, [[Iron Man]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Spider-Man one titled, ''Marvel CD-ROM Comics featuring Spider-Man'' included animation from the series, trivia games, and four complete issues of the comic narrated by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]].\n\n===Capcom's arcade fighting games===\n''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' for the [[CP System II|CPS II]] arcade hardware was a result of the success of Capcom's [[fighting game]] ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. It was developed by Capcom, released in 1995, ported to [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]] and [[MS-DOS]] and features Spider-Man as a playable character.\n\n''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]]'', an unrelated action game, was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. The game involves utilizing each of the Marvel superheroes through each of their levels to collect one of the Gems needed to complete the game. The SNES features Iron Man, [[Captain America]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and Spider-Man.\n\nAfter ''Children of the Atom'' and ''Marvel Super Heroes'', a partnership between Marvel and Capcom began, combining the two universes into the [[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|''Marvel vs. Capcom'' fighting game series]]. Spider-Man would appear as a playable character in several titles:\n*''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' (2000)\nVenom also appears as a playable character in the latter two games.\nSpider-Man later returns in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.\n\nThis Spider-Man was seemingly killed by Morlun with a single punch during the events of [[Spider-Verse]].\n\n===''The Amazing Spider-Man: Web of Fire''===\n''[[Spider-Man: Web of Fire]]'' was developed by Harutyun Zatikian in 1996 and published by Sega for the [[Sega 32X]], as one the final titles for the add-on. The game is a platform action game similar to the previous Sega title, ''Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin''. This time Spider-Man teams up with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to prevent the invading forces of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] from taking over New York City. The game is broken into six levels with bosses such as the Eel, Tangle, and the Super-Adaptoid.\n\n===''Spider-Man: The Sinister Six''===\n''Spider-Man: The Sinister Six'', developed by [[Brooklyn Multimedia]] was an [[adventure game]] for the PC. The game was released in 1996 and published by Byron Preiss Multimedia. The game allowed the user to choose the path the narrative would take, interact with characters as Peter Parker, collect items, and confront various puzzles, boss battles, and mini games.\n\n===''Marvel Creativity Center''===\n''Marvel Creativity Center'', released in 1997 for both [[IBM PC clone|PC]] and [[Apple Mac]] by [[Cloud 9 Interactive]], teaches the user how to create comics, the 'Marvel Way' with Stan Lee and Spider-Man acting as guides. The \"story\" involves Marvel studios being infiltrated by a mystery villain who has broken contact with all the regular Marvel artists and writers, leaving it up to the user to plot, script, illustrate and letter a comic.\n\n==2000s==\nThroughout the late 1990s, Marvel Comics suffered an industry slump with Marvel filing for [[bankruptcy]], which explains the lack of ''Spider-Man'' games towards the end of the late 1990s. However, by 2000, Marvel was profitable again and was gearing up to drop the [[Comics Code Authority]] and established its own rating system. They began seriously licensing its characters for major feature film adaptations (with the commercially successful ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' [[film]] premiering on July 14, 2000). By the late 2000s, new Spider-Man games were in the works, being published by [[Activision]], until January 2, 2014, when the license expired.<ref name=\"digitaltrends\">[http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/activision-marvels-partnership-comes-end/ Activision and Marvel\u2019s partnership comes to an end<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Early PlayStation and Game Boy Color games===\nAs a symbolic gesture of Marvel's return the development of two separate ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' titles for [[PlayStation]] and [[Game Boy Color]] were announced. [[Neversoft]]'s PlayStation iteration was highly successful. Enhanced versions were ported by other developers to the [[Nintendo 64]] in 2000 and PC CD-ROM and the [[Dreamcast]] in 2001. A [[sequel]], ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'' was released in 2001 for the PlayStation and developed by [[Vicarious Visions]]. In those two games, Spider-Man was voiced by [[Rino Romano]].\n\nA sequel to the Game Boy Color version, ''[[Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six]]'' (not related to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six) was also released in 2001 and was developed by [[Torus Games]].\n\nThe PlayStation Spider-Man utilized the same engine as ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2]]'' (released September 2000) which was also developed by Neversoft. As an [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]], developer [[Neversoft Entertainment]] included the ability to play as ''Spider-Man'' if the player achieved a high level of success in 'career mode'.\n\nWhen the [[Game Boy Advance]] launched one of the earliest titles released was ''[[Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace]]'' developed and published by Activision in 2001.\n\nIn September 2001, ''Spider-Man'' made a small appearance as one of the fighters in the fighting game by [[Paradox Development]], ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]]'' for PlayStation.\n\nIn ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]'', there was a deleted scene where Wolverine has his encounter with Spider-Man (again voiced by [[Rino Romano]]) in a ruined town. When Wolverine states that Spider-Man is off his home turf, Spider-Man states that he heard about the big bust-out at the Void and rode on the Charter Bus to the ruined town with the other superheroes that can't fly or teleport. When Spider-Man asks Wolverine if he needs help fighting Magneto, Wolverine tells him to deal with the chaos in town until Damage Control arrives.\n\n===''Spider-Man'' (film), ''Spider-Man 2'' and ''Spider-Man 3'' games===\nAs the live-action ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' movie was released in 2002, a game developed by [[Treyarch]] titled, ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]]'' was developed for PC, [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] with a separate title developed by [[Digital Eclipse Software]] for Game Boy Advance. The game play was similar to that of Neversoft's previous Spider-Man game, except it featured for the first time aerial combat, and to an extent allowed the user to 'web sling' over New York openly, although not being able to land on the ground below. The game sported the [[voice actor|voice]] of the actors from the film, including [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Willem Dafoe]], cult icon [[Bruce Campbell]], and including [[Josh Keaton]] as Harry Osborn and in a bonus story-mode where he wears Norman's Green Goblin gear.\n\nAfter the critical success of both the first Spider-Man film and the video game releases, Marvel ordered a wider selection of titles to coincide with the release of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. The flagship titles being Treyarch's ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2: The Game]]'' for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, which extended the open environment concept started by their previous title. Unlike the previous generation of games based on the film, Treyarch's game was not released for the PC, and in its stead was an original game developed by [[Fizz Factor]]. The reasons for this remain unclear, and Fizz Factors game did not include the open environment game play as seen in Treyarch's game and appeared to be targeted towards a younger audience, despite the game being marketed the same as the console release. Later, in 2005, another version of ''Spider-Man 2'', this time for Sony's new handheld, the [[PlayStation Portable]]; which debuted in the first quarter of the year along with the system, was released. The PSP version of Spider-Man 2 was the first action games for the PSP, Spider-Man has to stay at a certain height, and Vulture is exclusive to the PSP version. The PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube got high critical acclaim and is often the basis for comparison for other Spider-Man video games.\n\nIn 2007 ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3: The Game]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Wii]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. It's very similar to the prequel. The Next Gen version of the game was developed by [[Treyarch]], the other console version was developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], and the PC version by [[Beenox]].  [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.\n\n===Sony Pictures Mobile games===\n[[Sony Pictures Mobile]] released a Spider-Man game for [[Mobile phone|wireless phone]] in 2003. The game was such a success that a number of titles were planned to be released alongside the ''Spider-Man 2'' film. Some titles were delayed and are slowly being released. Current titles include; ''Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock'' (May 2004) (a multi-level action-adventure game where Spider-Man battles Doc Ock), ''Spider-Man 2 Pinball'' (May 2004) (virtual pinball game, themed with Spider-Man & Doc Ock characters), ''Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Subway'' (April 2005) (the player acts as Spider-Man as he leaps, swings and soars through the city, defeating thugs and ultimately facing off with Doc Ock. The 3D games feature superior graphics and sound and showcase the advanced capabilities of new mobile handsets) and ''Spider-Man 2 Text Messaging Games'' (players must show their knowledge of Spider-Man trivia and navigate through a mission-based text game). Other hand handheld versions developed appeared on the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] by [[Vicarious Visions]] and [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] by [[Backbone Entertainment]].\n\n===JakksTVGames===\nIn November 2004, in time for Christmas JakksTVGames released an all inclusive controller that includes an ATV input jack, to operate as a console plugged straight into a TV. It was titled ''Spider-Man Controller with 5 TV Games'', and as the name suggests includes five original video games each with a different goal; ''Streets of the City'', ''Spider Training'', ''Venom's Vindication'', ''Escape from the Sewers'', and ''Vulture's Venture''.\n\n===Micro Games of America===\nAdditionally, [[MGA Entertainment|Micro Games of America]] towards the end of 2004 released a portable [[LCD]] game, titled ''Spider-Man 2''. Sony Pictures has also released, their own LCD game, titled ''Spider-Man 2 Hand Held Game'' and a virtual reality head set portable game titled, ''Spider-Man 2 VR 3D''.\n\n===''Spider-Man & Friends''===\nAs 2005 began, Activision released ''Spider-Man & Friends'' for PC. It was developed by their internal company, [[Activision Value]] and targeted towards young children. It featured action game based gameplay with various puzzles used as a learning tool. In March, Activision Value released their second title based on the Spider-Man franchise, ''Spider-Man Print Studio''. The software allows the user to print various [[calendars]], [[poster]]s, [[bookmark]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]], door hangers, and masks from a library of pre-existing Spider-Man themed art, with Spider-Man as a guide to show the user the software.\n\n===''Ultimate Spider-Man''===\nSpider-Man is featured in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Sean Marquette]]. Based on the Marvel Comics' Ultimate Spider-Man, it was released on September 22, 2005 for Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, PC, Mobile Phones, and Game Boy Advance. In this game, players get to play both hero Spider-Man and fan-favorite villain Venom in their own storylines. The game also introduces the new Comic Inking Animation technology, [[cel shading]] that makes the entire game appear as if it were a living comic-book. The writing and art design for Ultimate Spider-Man were done by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, respectively, who both have worked on the comic book series of the same name since it was launched. The game's plot line also supposedly fits into the USM chronology, with issues 86 - 88 being advertised dealing with the aftermath of the events of the game. However, the issues did not deal with the game, and in fact had several continuity errors with the game (E.g. Silver Sable not knowing who Spider-Man is) and until Venom shows up again, it is open to interpretation where the game takes place.\n\n===''Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects''===\nAlso in September 2005, ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]'' was released, which includes both Spider-Man (voiced by [[Alistair Abell]]) and Venom as playable characters. The game was released for [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]].\n\nA spiritual sequel to ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects|Marvel Nemesis]]'' was scheduled for release. A preview of the game was released containing a battle between Spider-Man and [[Doctor Doom]], but due to the end of the partnership between EA and Marvel the game was cancelled.\n\n===''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''===\nSpider-Man is a featured playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. The [[Scarlet Spider]] is an alternate costume for Spider-Man outside of his Classic, Symbiote, and Stark Armor costumes. Outside of playable character status, he is seen in the cutscenes with [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Spider-Man has special dialogue with various characters ranging from Dark Spider-Man and Dark Thor, [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Henry Pym]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]], [[Mysterio]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]. A simulation disk has Spider-Man defending [[Dum Dum Dugan]] from Scorpion while on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Omega Base. Spider-Man shows mock envy to his allies during mission briefings, making comments on S.H.I.E.L.D's advanced Hellicarrier and Omega base, [[Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark's]] wealth and the [[X-Men]]'s relationship with the [[Shi'ar]] Empire.\n\nSpider-Man is also in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]].\n\n===''Spider-Man: Battle for New York''===\nThis [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] video game ''[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]'' was set in the Marvel Ultimate universe. Spider-Man is voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].\n\n===''Spider-Man 3''===\nThe ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' [[video game|game]] was released at the same time as the film. The game is on all formats, with the [[PlayStation 3]] receiving a Collector's Edition featuring an exclusive playable character - Harry Osborn's \"New Goblin\" persona. The black suit was handled differently by the different development teams that worked on the game, with some opting to keep the player in the costume until a certain point in the game whilst other versions of the game utilised the suit in a more strategic fashion, allowing the player to don or remove the costume while suffering side effects appropriate to how much the suit is worn. In October 2007, the New Goblin was released onto the Xbox LIVE Marketplace, making the PC version of ''Spider-Man 3'', besides the PS2 and Wii, the only version developed by Treyarch not to have the New Goblin as a playable character (Excluding fight against Sandman).\n\nIn 2007, two ''Spider-Man 3'' games were released for mobile devices, developed by [[Javaground]] USA and produced by [[Sony Online Entertainment]]. [http://webstart.mpowerplayer.com/content.mpowerplayer.com/hosting/sonypictures.com/SpiderMan3.jad ''Spider Man 3 Action''] was released early in the year, followed by ''Spider-Man 3 Puzzle'' a few months later.\n\n===''Spider-Man: Friend or Foe''===\n''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' was released on October 2, 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, PC, PSP and Nintendo DS where [[James Arnold Taylor]] reprised his role of Spider-Man. The game is a different take on the three films, adding humor and story changes. Players can team up with a number of super villains from the comics, including Venom, Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Sandman, Black Cat, etc.\n\n===Stern Pinball game===\n[[Stern Pinball]] has developed a Spider-Man pinball machine that encompasses all three Spider-Man theatrical releases, released in June 2007. This machine is designed by [[Steve Ritchie (pinball designer)|Steve Ritchie]] and programmed by Lyman Sheats.\n\n===''Spider-Man: Web of Shadows''===\nSpider-Man appears as the lead in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by Mike Vaughn. Released on October 21, 2008, ''Web of Shadows'' has received positive reviews with critics praising the idea of an original story, but citing poor polish and execution. Four separate versions of the game were released: a 3D action game for PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Microsoft Windows, a 2.5D side-scrolling beat 'em up action game for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 (called Amazing Allies Edition), and a 2.5D side-scrolling brawler/platformer for the Nintendo DS.\n\n===''Marvel Super Hero Squad''===\nSpider-Man appears as one of the playable heroes in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' with [[Josh Keaton]] reprising the role.

At this time the [[fictional character]] had already featured in the [[animated series]] ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', a segment on the [[children's television series]] ''[[The Electric Company]]'' (called ''[[Spidey Super Stories]]''), and the [[live action]] [[prime time]] series ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. As a result of the success, Marvel Comics licensed the character into a stream of electronic games.\n\n===Atari 2600===\nIn 1982, [[Parker Brothers]] published a game for the [[Atari 2600]] (and its clone system, the [[Sears Video Arcade]]) titled ''[[Spider-Man (Atari 2600)|Spider-Man]]''. The action game involves climbing a skyscraper, capturing criminals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atariage.com/manual_page.php?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=477&ItemTypeID=&currentPage=3&maxPages=8 |title=AtariAge.com |publisher=AtariAge.com |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> and defusing bombs set by the [[Green Goblin]].

The story of the game is told in a series of comic panels, with the game play similar to that of ''[[Street Fighter]]'': The player, as either [[Captain America]] or Spider-Man, battles villains one-on-one until facing [[Doctor Doom]].\n\nIn December 1989, ''[[The Revenge of Shinobi]]'' was released on the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The game's boss battles feature comic book characters including Spider-Man and Batman, as well as famous movie characters, including Terminator and Godzilla, and even Rambo as normal-stage enemy. Initially, Spider-Man was included without consent from Marvel, but another version was released, this time with the copyright message shown in the beginning of the game, giving credit to Marvel, and editing the looks of Batman, Rambo and Godzilla, so avoiding a possible lawsuit; a [[Sega CD]] version was released, being derived from the altered version.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the 1990s, comics enjoyed a boom, and the early 1990s saw a myriad of [[video games]] based on high-profile comic story lines and the 1994 ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.\n\n===Home computers===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (1990 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was the first game of the decade released, a puzzle oriented action game developed by [[Oxford Digital Enterprises]] and released in 1990 for the Amiga and ported to MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and [[Atari ST]]. The title was published by [[Paragon Software Corporation]] and features over 250 screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/amazing-spider-man |title=Moby Games |publisher=Moby Games |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Game Boy===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (handheld video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', developed by [[Rare (company)|Rareware]] and released in 1990 was the first in a trilogy for the newly introduced [[Game Boy]]. The game was published by [[LJN]] (a subsidiary of [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]]), the first of a series of games published based on licensed Marvel characters. The game play involves running across [[New York City|New York]] chasing supervillains to locate [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spiderman.ugo.com/?cur=video-games |title=UGO.com Spider-Man Game Guide |publisher=Spiderman.ugo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317054430/http://spiderman.ugo.com/?cur=video-games |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (1992 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' was developed by B.I.T.S and released in 1992. The game is a side-scrolling [[beat-'em up]]. Spider-Man attempts to clear his name after he is accused of a crime committed by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].\n\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers|Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers]]'', the third in the series, was released in 1993 by [[B.I.T.S.]].\n\n''[[The Punisher: The Ultimate Payback!]]'' by [[Australia|Australian]] company [[Beam Software]] was released in 1991 for the Game Boy. The game is much like ''[[Operation Wolf]]'', with the Punisher shooting villains while protecting the innocent. Spider-Man appears between the action to offer advice on how to beat upcoming levels and swings in to rescue hostages once their captors have been shot.\n\n===Games for the Sega family of consoles===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]'', developed and published by [[Sega]] and released in 1990, was the first game featuring ''Spider-Man'' on [[Sega]] consoles. The game premiered on the [[Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in 1991, followed by the [[Game Gear]] in 1992, and to the [[Sega CD]] in 1993. Fundamentally, the game is the same on each platform with each iteration including new levels, enhanced graphics and a few incremental improvements to the game play. The story involves Spider-Man trying to collect six keys from six villains to defuse a bomb in New York planted by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Spider-Man has a finite supply of web fluid and the only way to replenish is to take photos, most profitably of the supervillains, to sell to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''.\n\n''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]'' was released in 1991 for coin-operated [[video arcade|arcades]]. Developed by [[Sega]] on [[Sega System 32]] hardware, the game is a four-player, platform beat-'em-up similar to [[Data East]]'s ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]'' released the same year. The player plays as Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], or [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], with the game divided into four acts.\n[[File:Spider-man-nes-game-screenshot.png|thumb|170px|right|The NES game, ''Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six''.]]\n\n===Nintendo Entertainment System===\n''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]'' developed by B.I.T.S. and released in 1992 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was the first game featuring Spider-Man on the NES. It was an action platform game that involved Spider-Man swinging across various levels to defeat each one of the Sinister Six; Electro, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Mysterio]], Hobgoblin, [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and Doctor Octopus. Ports to the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] followed in 1993.\n\n===Genesis and Super NES===\n''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', the first Spider-Man cross platform game, was released on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]]. It was first developed for the [[Super NES]] in 1992 by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] (who went on to produce several games for Marvel) and published by [[LJN]]. The game was later ported to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] in 1993. The game involves rescuing four of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhero [[X-Men]] ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]) from an [[assassination|assassin]] named [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. The player must navigate Spider-Man in search of the captured heroes (who join Spider-Man when found), fighting a variety of super villains. Software Creations later adapted the game to the Game Boy in 1993 and to Game Gear in 1994.\n\n''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', released on Super NES and Genesis in 1994, was the first one of two major Marvel comic book storyline adaptations by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]]. ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]'' released in 1995 for Super NES, Genesis and PC was the sequel. Both games are side scrolling beat-'em up action games where the player controls either Spider-Man or Venom, fighting various villains from the comic book plotlines.\n\n''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man]]'' from 1995, was developed by Western Technologies and published by Acclaim on the Genesis, and by [[LJN]] on the Super NES. It marked the beginning of a range of software incorporating elements from the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon. The game is a side scrolling action platformer. The Super NES game features six levels, five bosses, and fourteen sub-bosses. The Genesis game features five levels, five bosses, and thirteen sub-bosses. The game also features the Fantastic Four.\n\n===Super Famicom===\n''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'' was released in 1995 for the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan, very loosely based on the mini-series ''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man''.\n\n===Tiger's LCD games===\nOver the years [[Tiger Electronics]] released several handheld [[LCD]] Spider-Man games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tiger/Spiderman.htm |title=Tiger Spider-Man |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===''Spider-Man Cartoon Maker''===\n''[[Spider-Man Cartoon Maker]]'', released in 1995 by [[Knowledge Adventure]], is a software package that allowed the user to create films by utilizing an archive of backdrops, animations and props from the ''Spider-Man'' animated series. The game featured the voice of [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]], who played Spider-Man in the series.\n\n===''Marvel CD-ROM Comics featuring Spider-Man''===\nThat same year Marvel attempted to release classic comic books onto [[CD-ROM]]. Only four were ever produced, based on Spider-Man, the X-Men, [[Iron Man]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Spider-Man one titled, ''Marvel CD-ROM Comics featuring Spider-Man'' included animation from the series, trivia games, and four complete issues of the comic narrated by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]].\n\n===Capcom's arcade fighting games===\n''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' for the [[CP System II|CPS II]] arcade hardware was a result of the success of Capcom's [[fighting game]] ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. It was developed by Capcom, released in 1995, ported to [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]] and [[MS-DOS]] and features Spider-Man as a playable character.\n\n''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]]'', an unrelated action game, was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. The game involves utilizing each of the Marvel superheroes through each of their levels to collect one of the Gems needed to complete the game. The SNES features Iron Man, [[Captain America]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and Spider-Man.\n\nAfter ''Children of the Atom'' and ''Marvel Super Heroes'', a partnership between Marvel and Capcom began, combining the two universes into the [[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|''Marvel vs. Capcom'' fighting game series]]. Spider-Man would appear as a playable character in several titles:\n*''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' (2000)\nVenom also appears as a playable character in the latter two games.\nSpider-Man later returns in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.\n\nThis Spider-Man was seemingly killed by Morlun with a single punch during the events of [[Spider-Verse]].\n\n===''The Amazing Spider-Man: Web of Fire''===\n''[[Spider-Man: Web of Fire]]'' was developed by Harutyun Zatikian in 1996 and published by Sega for the [[Sega 32X]], as one the final titles for the add-on. The game is a platform action game similar to the previous Sega title, ''Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin''. This time Spider-Man teams up with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to prevent the invading forces of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] from taking over New York City. The game is broken into six levels with bosses such as the Eel, Tangle, and the Super-Adaptoid.\n\n===''Spider-Man: The Sinister Six''===\n''Spider-Man: The Sinister Six'', developed by [[Brooklyn Multimedia]] was an [[adventure game]] for the PC. The game was released in 1996 and published by Byron Preiss Multimedia. The game allowed the user to choose the path the narrative would take, interact with characters as Peter Parker, collect items, and confront various puzzles, boss battles, and mini games.\n\n===''Marvel Creativity Center''===\n''Marvel Creativity Center'', released in 1997 for both [[IBM PC clone|PC]] and [[Apple Mac]] by [[Cloud 9 Interactive]], teaches the user how to create comics, the 'Marvel Way' with Stan Lee and Spider-Man acting as guides. The \"story\" involves Marvel studios being infiltrated by a mystery villain who has broken contact with all the regular Marvel artists and writers, leaving it up to the user to plot, script, illustrate and letter a comic.\n\n==2000s==\nThroughout the late 1990s, Marvel Comics suffered an industry slump with Marvel filing for [[bankruptcy]], which explains the lack of ''Spider-Man'' games towards the end of the late 1990s. However, by 2000, Marvel was profitable again and was gearing up to drop the [[Comics Code Authority]] and established its own rating system. They began seriously licensing its characters for major feature film adaptations (with the commercially successful ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' [[film]] premiering on July 14, 2000). By the late 2000s, new Spider-Man games were in the works, being published by [[Activision]], until January 2, 2014, when the license expired.<ref name=\"digitaltrends\">[http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/activision-marvels-partnership-comes-end/ Activision and Marvel\u2019s partnership comes to an end<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Early PlayStation and Game Boy Color games===\nAs a symbolic gesture of Marvel's return the development of two separate ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' titles for [[PlayStation]] and [[Game Boy Color]] were announced. [[Neversoft]]'s PlayStation iteration was highly successful. Enhanced versions were ported by other developers to the [[Nintendo 64]] in 2000 and PC CD-ROM and the [[Dreamcast]] in 2001. A [[sequel]], ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'' was released in 2001 for the PlayStation and developed by [[Vicarious Visions]]. In those two games, Spider-Man was voiced by [[Rino Romano]].\n\nA sequel to the Game Boy Color version, ''[[Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six]]'' (not related to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six) was also released in 2001 and was developed by [[Torus Games]].\n\nThe PlayStation Spider-Man utilized the same engine as ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2]]'' (released September 2000) which was also developed by Neversoft. As an [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]], developer [[Neversoft Entertainment]] included the ability to play as ''Spider-Man'' if the player achieved a high level of success in 'career mode'.\n\nWhen the [[Game Boy Advance]] launched one of the earliest titles released was ''[[Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace]]'' developed and published by Activision in 2001.\n\nIn September 2001, ''Spider-Man'' made a small appearance as one of the fighters in the fighting game by [[Paradox Development]], ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]]'' for PlayStation.\n\nIn ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]'', there was a deleted scene where Wolverine has his encounter with Spider-Man (again voiced by [[Rino Romano]]) in a ruined town. When Wolverine states that Spider-Man is off his home turf, Spider-Man states that he heard about the big bust-out at the Void and rode on the Charter Bus to the ruined town with the other superheroes that can't fly or teleport. When Spider-Man asks Wolverine if he needs help fighting Magneto, Wolverine tells him to deal with the chaos in town until Damage Control arrives.\n\n===''Spider-Man'' (film), ''Spider-Man 2'' and ''Spider-Man 3'' games===\nAs the live-action ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' movie was released in 2002, a game developed by [[Treyarch]] titled, ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]]'' was developed for PC, [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] with a separate title developed by [[Digital Eclipse Software]] for Game Boy Advance. The game play was similar to that of Neversoft's previous Spider-Man game, except it featured for the first time aerial combat, and to an extent allowed the user to 'web sling' over New York openly, although not being able to land on the ground below. The game sported the [[voice actor|voice]] of the actors from the film, including [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Willem Dafoe]], cult icon [[Bruce Campbell]], and including [[Josh Keaton]] as Harry Osborn and in a bonus story-mode where he wears Norman's Green Goblin gear.\n\nAfter the critical success of both the first Spider-Man film and the video game releases, Marvel ordered a wider selection of titles to coincide with the release of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. The flagship titles being Treyarch's ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2: The Game]]'' for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, which extended the open environment concept started by their previous title. Unlike the previous generation of games based on the film, Treyarch's game was not released for the PC, and in its stead was an original game developed by [[Fizz Factor]]. The reasons for this remain unclear, and Fizz Factors game did not include the open environment game play as seen in Treyarch's game and appeared to be targeted towards a younger audience, despite the game being marketed the same as the console release. Later, in 2005, another version of ''Spider-Man 2'', this time for Sony's new handheld, the [[PlayStation Portable]]; which debuted in the first quarter of the year along with the system, was released. The PSP version of Spider-Man 2 was the first action games for the PSP, Spider-Man has to stay at a certain height, and Vulture is exclusive to the PSP version. The PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube got high critical acclaim and is often the basis for comparison for other Spider-Man video games.\n\nIn 2007 ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3: The Game]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Wii]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. It's very similar to the prequel. The Next Gen version of the game was developed by [[Treyarch]], the other console version was developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], and the PC version by [[Beenox]].  [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.\n\n===Sony Pictures Mobile games===\n[[Sony Pictures Mobile]] released a Spider-Man game for [[Mobile phone|wireless phone]] in 2003. The game was such a success that a number of titles were planned to be released alongside the ''Spider-Man 2'' film. Some titles were delayed and are slowly being released. Current titles include; ''Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock'' (May 2004) (a multi-level action-adventure game where Spider-Man battles Doc Ock), ''Spider-Man 2 Pinball'' (May 2004) (virtual pinball game, themed with Spider-Man & Doc Ock characters), ''Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Subway'' (April 2005) (the player acts as Spider-Man as he leaps, swings and soars through the city, defeating thugs and ultimately facing off with Doc Ock. The 3D games feature superior graphics and sound and showcase the advanced capabilities of new mobile handsets) and ''Spider-Man 2 Text Messaging Games'' (players must show their knowledge of Spider-Man trivia and navigate through a mission-based text game). Other hand handheld versions developed appeared on the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] by [[Vicarious Visions]] and [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] by [[Backbone Entertainment]].\n\n===JakksTVGames===\nIn November 2004, in time for Christmas JakksTVGames released an all inclusive controller that includes an ATV input jack, to operate as a console plugged straight into a TV. It was titled ''Spider-Man Controller with 5 TV Games'', and as the name suggests includes five original video games each with a different goal; ''Streets of the City'', ''Spider Training'', ''Venom's Vindication'', ''Escape from the Sewers'', and ''Vulture's Venture''.\n\n===Micro Games of America===\nAdditionally, [[MGA Entertainment|Micro Games of America]] towards the end of 2004 released a portable [[LCD]] game, titled ''Spider-Man 2''. Sony Pictures has also released, their own LCD game, titled ''Spider-Man 2 Hand Held Game'' and a virtual reality head set portable game titled, ''Spider-Man 2 VR 3D''.\n\n===''Spider-Man & Friends''===\nAs 2005 began, Activision released ''Spider-Man & Friends'' for PC. It was developed by their internal company, [[Activision Value]] and targeted towards young children. It featured action game based gameplay with various puzzles used as a learning tool. In March, Activision Value released their second title based on the Spider-Man franchise, ''Spider-Man Print Studio''. The software allows the user to print various [[calendars]], [[poster]]s, [[bookmark]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]], door hangers, and masks from a library of pre-existing Spider-Man themed art, with Spider-Man as a guide to show the user the software.\n\n===''Ultimate Spider-Man''===\nSpider-Man is featured in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Sean Marquette]]. Based on the Marvel Comics' Ultimate Spider-Man, it was released on September 22, 2005 for Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, PC, Mobile Phones, and Game Boy Advance. In this game, players get to play both hero Spider-Man and fan-favorite villain Venom in their own storylines. The game also introduces the new Comic Inking Animation technology, [[cel shading]] that makes the entire game appear as if it were a living comic-book. The writing and art design for Ultimate Spider-Man were done by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, respectively, who both have worked on the comic book series of the same name since it was launched. The game's plot line also supposedly fits into the USM chronology, with issues 86 - 88 being advertised dealing with the aftermath of the events of the game. However, the issues did not deal with the game, and in fact had several continuity errors with the game (E.g. Silver Sable not knowing who Spider-Man is) and until Venom shows up again, it is open to interpretation where the game takes place.\n\n===''Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects''===\nAlso in September 2005, ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]'' was released, which includes both Spider-Man (voiced by [[Alistair Abell]]) and Venom as playable characters. The game was released for [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]].\n\nA spiritual sequel to ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects|Marvel Nemesis]]'' was scheduled for release. A preview of the game was released containing a battle between Spider-Man and [[Doctor Doom]], but due to the end of the partnership between EA and Marvel the game was cancelled.\n\n===''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''===\nSpider-Man is a featured playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. The [[Scarlet Spider]] is an alternate costume for Spider-Man outside of his Classic, Symbiote, and Stark Armor costumes. Outside of playable character status, he is seen in the cutscenes with [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Spider-Man has special dialogue with various characters ranging from Dark Spider-Man and Dark Thor, [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Henry Pym]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]], [[Mysterio]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]. A simulation disk has Spider-Man defending [[Dum Dum Dugan]] from Scorpion while on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Omega Base. Spider-Man shows mock envy to his allies during mission briefings, making comments on S.H.I.E.L.D's advanced Hellicarrier and Omega base, [[Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark's]] wealth and the [[X-Men]]'s relationship with the [[Shi'ar]] Empire.\n\nSpider-Man is also in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]].\n\n===''Spider-Man: Battle for New York''===\nThis [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] video game ''[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]'' was set in the Marvel Ultimate universe. Spider-Man is voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].\n\n===''Spider-Man 3''===\nThe ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' [[video game|game]] was released at the same time as the film. The game is on all formats, with the [[PlayStation 3]] receiving a Collector's Edition featuring an exclusive playable character - Harry Osborn's \"New Goblin\" persona. The black suit was handled differently by the different development teams that worked on the game, with some opting to keep the player in the costume until a certain point in the game whilst other versions of the game utilised the suit in a more strategic fashion, allowing the player to don or remove the costume while suffering side effects appropriate to how much the suit is worn. In October 2007, the New Goblin was released onto the Xbox LIVE Marketplace, making the PC version of ''Spider-Man 3'', besides the PS2 and Wii, the only version developed by Treyarch not to have the New Goblin as a playable character (Excluding fight against Sandman).\n\nIn 2007, two ''Spider-Man 3'' games were released for mobile devices, developed by [[Javaground]] USA and produced by [[Sony Online Entertainment]].

Players can team up with a number of super villains from the comics, including Venom, Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Sandman, Black Cat, etc.\n\n===Stern Pinball game===\n[[Stern Pinball]] has developed a Spider-Man pinball machine that encompasses all three Spider-Man theatrical releases, released in June 2007.

Four separate versions of the game were released: a 3D action game for PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Microsoft Windows, a 2.5D side-scrolling beat 'em up action game for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 (called Amazing Allies Edition), and a 2.5D side-scrolling brawler/platformer for the Nintendo DS.\n\n===''Marvel Super Hero Squad''===\nSpider-Man appears as one of the playable heroes in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' with [[Josh Keaton]] reprising the role.

The song reached number one in every country except ironically the African country of Niger. Barrack Obama performed the tune at his 2010 inauguration, which received a standing ovation. It\u2019s reported that drug cartel leader Mort made love only to the song when sharing his seed with his cartel. The Colony of Mort banned the song after the infamous 2016 air strike. Woman is the Nigger of the world has been praised as a song of unity and full equality, although white men feel discriminated against because they are not mentioned in the hit. Speaking of hits it became Lennon\u2019s most successful hit since his wife. It is Obama\u2019s favourite song. \n\n==Composition==\nThe phrase \"woman is the nigger of the world\" was coined by Yoko Ono in an interview with ''[[Nova (UK magazine)|Nova]]'' magazine in 1969 and was quoted on the magazine's cover. Literary analysts note that the phrase owes much to [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Chang | first=Jeff | title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America | location=New York | date=2014 | publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] | page=85 | isbn=0-312571-29-1}}</ref> in which the protagonist Janie Crawford's Grandmother says \"De nigger woman is de mule uh de world so fur as Ah can see.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hurston|first1=Zora Neale|title=Their Eyes Were Watching God|date=1986|publisher=Virago Press|location=London|isbn=9780860685241|page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Rees | first=Nigel | title=Mark My Words: Great Quotations and the Stories Behind Them | location=New York | date=2002 | publisher=[[Sterling Publishing]] | page=418 | isbn=0-760735-32-8 }}</ref>  The song describes women's subservience to men and [[misogyny]] across all cultures.\n\nIn a 1972 interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', John Lennon stated that Irish revolutionary [[James Connolly]] was an inspiration for the song.

There is a tradition of putting bow and arrow in a ceremony called CHHATHIHAR ( celebration of childbirth after on 6th day ). So, in conclusion this caste has been transformed from Chhetris.

The project was planned for [[Rampart Canyon]] (also known as Rampart Gorge)  just {{convert|31|mi|km}} southwest of the village of [[Rampart, Alaska]] and about {{convert|105|mi|km}} west-northwest of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].\n\nThe resulting dam would have created a lake roughly the size of [[Lake Erie]], making it the largest man-made [[reservoir]] in the world. The plan for the dam itself called for a concrete structure {{convert|530|ft|0}} high with a top length of about {{convert|4700|ft|-1}}. The proposed power facilities would have consistently generated between 3.5 and 5 [[gigawatt]]s of electricity, based on the flow of the river as it differs between winter and summer.\n\nThough supported by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, the project was canceled after objections were raised. [[Alaska Natives|Native Alaskans]] in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the [[Yukon Flats]], a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of [[waterfowl]]. [[Fiscal conservatism|Fiscal conservatives]] opposed the dam on the grounds of its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.\n\nBecause of these objections, [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] formally opposed construction of the dam in 1967, and the project was shelved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nevertheless completed its engineering study of the project in 1971, and the final report was released to the public in 1979. In 1980, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] created the [[Yukon Flats National Wildlife Sanctuary]], which formally protected the area from development and disallowed any similar project.\n\n== Site ==\n[[Image:Rampart Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The northern portion of [[Rampart Canyon]] is seen in 1949.]]\nFrom its headwaters in the [[Coast Mountains]], the Yukon River flows northwest, across the Yukon\u2013Alaska border, until it intersects the [[Porcupine River]] at the settlement of [[Fort Yukon]]. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the [[Tanana River|Tanana]] and [[Koyukuk River|Koyukuk]] rivers before looping south, then north into [[Norton Sound]] in the [[Bering Sea]].<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District.

Gruening estimated that the project would cost roughly $1.2 billion  to complete.<ref name=\"start\"/>\n\nAs investigation and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers reached an agreement with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources.<ref>Stahr, Edward V. and Udall, Stewart. \"Memorandum of agreement\", U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. March 14, 1962.</ref> This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point,<ref name=\"Coates141\">Coates, p. 141</ref> as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact.

April 23, 1962.</ref> Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.\n\nThe interim Corps of Engineers report was released in December 1963, and reported that building the dam was feasible from an engineering standpoint. President [[John F. Kennedy]] supported the project, and lobbied for an appropriation of $197,000 (1963 dollars) to continue study of the project. The needed money was included in a House appropriations bill, and studies continued.<ref name=\"initreport\">Davies, Lawrence E. \"Alaskans press for a hydroelectric dam on Yukon\", ''The New York Times''.

It would raise the height of the Yukon River from {{convert|215|ft|0}} above sea level to approximately {{convert|656|ft|0}}. The resulting reservoir would be {{convert|400|mi|-1}} long, {{convert|80|mi|-1}} wide, and have a surface area greater than that of Lake Erie. The power facilities for the project would produce a maximum of 5 gigawatts of electricity.<ref name=\"controversyrage\">Davies, Lawrence E. \"Controversy rages over plans for big Alaska power project\", ''The New York Times''.

Volume 76, No. 5.</ref>\n\nIn April 1964, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) released its report on the project. Though only a part of the larger Department of the Interior study, the FWS report came down strongly opposed to the dam on the grounds that it would irrevocably destroy the Yukon Flats, a critical waterfowl breeding ground.<ref name=\"Coates148\">Coates, p. 148</ref> In January 1965, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] set aside almost {{convert|9000000|acre|-5}} of land for construction of the dam and reservoir.<ref>U.S. Department of the Interior. \"Rampart Canyon power site lands in Alaska classified\", U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service press release.

Spurr, dean of the Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an authority on forestry and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaska's projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (silver) salmon. It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats.  There would also have been a sharp decline in both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals:  muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurr's report noted: \"[It]is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the animal population supported by the inundated habitat.\"<ref>Rampart Dam and the Economic Development of Alaska (Ann Arbor: the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources, March 1966) at 49.</ref>\n\nIn March 1966 Spurr's team issued its final report, finding that the dam was not a cost-effective investment.<ref>See generally Stephen J. Spurr,  In Search of the Kuskokwim, and Other Great Endeavors: the Life and Times of J. Edward Spurr (Kenmore, Washington: Epicenter Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn January 1965, the Department of the Interior completed its three-volume, 1,000-page study of the Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies of the impact on the region's Alaska Native population.<ref>Department of the Interior.

Secretary Udall cited the fish and wildlife losses that would result, the availability of less-costly alternatives, and the fact that no recreational benefits would accrue.<ref name=\"Coates153\">Coates, p. 153</ref>\n\n== Final design ==\n[[Image:Rampart Dam plan.jpg|thumb|right|An architectural drawing of the final Rampart Dam plan, created by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].]]\nDespite the Interior Department's rejection of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ''Notice of Completion of Report on the Rampart Canyon Project.'' Washington, D.C. June 25, 1971.</ref> Because the construction season at the site is only five months,{{ref label|Note1|A|A}} the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades would be needed to build the dam and associated structures.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Preparation ===\nDue to the lack of any land transportation route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from [[Manley Hot Springs, Alaska|Eureka]], about {{convert|30|mi|0}} away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site.<ref name=\"p17\">Corps of Engineers, p. 17</ref> A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, [[Power station|powerhouse]], and other structures.<ref name=\"p17\"/> Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the [[cofferdam]]s needed to clear the Yukon River [[streambed]] for construction.<ref name=\"p17\"/> Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. D-3</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nSite clearing and foundation work would have been scheduled to begin after completion of the diversion work in the seventh year of the project. The first pouring of concrete was scheduled for the project's eighth year, and work on the powerhouse would have begun in the 11th year.<ref name=\"p17\"/> Owing to the large size of the reservoir, engineers estimated that the diversion tunnels would be closed in the 13th year, allowing construction to pace the filling of the new lake.<ref name=\"p17\"/> The reservoir would have reached a pool elevation of {{convert|550|ft|0}} in the 21st year, the dam would have been completed to elevation {{convert|660|ft|0}} in the 25th year, and the reservoir would have been filled to the full {{convert|640|ft|0|adj=on}} level in the 31st year after the project's start.<ref name=\"p17\"/> The installation of power generators was planned to follow as needed, with the last unit scheduled for installation by the 45th year of the project.<ref name=\"p17\"/>\n\nIn total, the dam would have consisted of a [[concrete]] gravity structure with a structural height of {{convert|510|ft|0}} and a [[hydraulic head|hydraulic height]] of {{convert|430|ft|0}}. At the elevation of {{convert|660|ft|0}}, the dam would have stretched for {{convert|4700|ft|-1}} from north to south. On the south bank would have been a concrete gravity [[spillway]] with a crest at elevation {{convert|600|ft|0}} and a maximum flow of {{convert|603000|ft3/s|-2}} at maximum pool elevation.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. D-1</ref> The power facilities would have consisted of twenty-two 266,000 kilowatt units and two 10,000 kilowatt service units.<ref>Corps of Engineers, pp. D-1, D-2</ref>\n\nMaterially, building the dam would have required {{convert|15000000|yd3|-4}} of concrete aggregate, {{convert|2900000|yd3|-4}} of rock fill, and another {{convert|1700000|yd3|-4}} of various other types of fill. Engineers suggested that some of the material could be found at the site, but the remainder would have to be brought from outside sources.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. 203</ref>\n\n=== Reservoir ===\nAt the projected pool elevation of {{convert|645|ft|0}}, the resulting reservoir would have had a total capacity of {{convert|1145000000|acre.ft|km3|-1|lk=in}}. The full pool length would have been about {{convert|270|mi|0}}, and the maximum width would have been {{convert|80|mi|0}}. The resulting lake would have had approximately 3,600 miles (5,800&nbsp;km) of shoreline and a total surface area of about {{convert|9844|sqmi|0}}.<ref name=\"d2\">Corps of Engineers, p. D-2</ref> Because the Yukon also is a transportation route, transshipment facilities were planned for below and above the dam site and would have been connected by road and rail links.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Because of the large size of the proposed reservoir and the need to allow some flow of the Yukon River downstream of the dam site for river navigation and fishing, engineers anticipated that filling the reservoir would take no fewer than 16 years to complete.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. B-23</ref>\n\n=== Anticipated costs ===\nThe Rampart Dam's large size had a correspondingly large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4&nbsp;million (1970 dollars) on construction of the physical dam alone, another $492&nbsp;million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39&nbsp;billion in total.<ref name=\"p18\">Corps of Engineers, p. 18</ref> That total included $15.59&nbsp;million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56&nbsp;million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7&nbsp;million for roads and bridges to access the area.<ref name=\"p18\"/> After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5&nbsp;million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2&nbsp;million for the maintenance of fish and wildlife facilities.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. D-6</ref>\n\n== Weather effects ==\nFrom the initial planning stages, proponents and opponents speculated that the large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon.<ref name=\"Constnews\"/> Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, and most of the reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around [[Great Slave Lake]] and [[Lake Baikal]], both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of [[lake-effect snow]]. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.<ref>Streten, N.A.

Kennedy\u2014made campaign stops in Alaska.

In 1960, Harold Moats of the Corps' Alaska district said, \"Rampart Canyon, the big one, is Alaska's most valuable resource, and as it is developed, Alaska will take her rightful place in the family of states contributing richly to the economy of the nation and the welfare of the whole free world.\"<ref name=\"Palmer2\">Palmer, p. 90</ref>\n\nIn early September 1963, a group of Alaska businesspeople, local government leaders, and industry representatives met at [[McKinley Park, Alaska|McKinley]] Park Lodge to organize lobbying efforts in favor of the dam.

Anthony Netboy, a [[salmon]] biologist employed by Yukon Power for America, claimed that one day, \"a housewife in Phoenix or L.A. will fry her eggs at breakfast with electricity generated on the far-off Yukon.\"<ref name=\"Coates160\">Coates, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Industrial argument ===\nSupporters of the project suggested that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as [[Aluminium production|aluminum smelting]], to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals.<ref>DRC, pp. 9, 20\u201324, and 79\u201396</ref> The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process the hundreds of millions of [[Board foot|board feet]] of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded.<ref>DRC, p. 96</ref> The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction\u2014not including jobs opened during the construction process.<ref name=\"DRC, pp. 102\u2013103\">DRC, pp. 102\u2013103</ref> Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.<ref name=\"DRC, pp. 102\u2013103\"/><ref>Brewer, p. 4</ref>\n\n=== Impact argument ===\nAt the time Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled.

An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing \"not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world and it would be difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding.\"<ref name=\"Palmer2\"/> In a 1963 letter responding to a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article about the dam, Gruening wrote, <blockquote>As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam will give them ample gainful employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.<ref name=\"SI letter\">Gruening, Ernest.

The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative [[Susitna Hydroelectric Project]] to supply Alaska's electric needs.<ref>Weeden, Robert B. \"Conservation and Kilowatts\", ''Alaska Conservation Society News Bulletin 2''. May 1961. pp 3\u20135.</ref> This was followed in early 1961 by an [[Alaska Sportsmen's Council]] resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies of the impact of the project on fish and game stocks.<ref>Staff Report. \"Report on ASC's annual meeting\", ''Alaska Conservation Society News Bulletin 2''.

Fifteen conservation groups pooled a total of $25,000 at the meeting<ref name=\"Palmer\">Palmer, p. 91.</ref> to begin an independent scientific study of the project and start an opposition campaign.<ref>Vileisis, p. 230</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1964, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a report on the impact of dam construction on the Flats. The report strongly opposed construction of the dam, saying in part, \"Nowhere in the history of water development in North America have the fish and wildlife losses anticipated to result from a single project been so overwhelming.\"<ref name=\"controversyrage\"/> The report also pointed out the threat the dam would pose to the Yukon River's large salmon population, which swim upstream each year to spawn.<ref name=\"controversyrage\"/> [[Arthur Laing]], Canada's [[Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (Canada)|minister of northern affairs and natural resources]], also expressed alarm at the potential waterfowl losses and the threat the dam posed to Canada's portion of the Yukon River salmon population.<ref>Laing, Arthur. \"Waterfowl&mdash;A Resource in Danger\", 37th annual convention of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. Ottawa, Canada. February 19, 1965.</ref>\n\nA May 1965 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine by author Paul Brooks illustrated the growing protests of conservationists concerned about the project. After traveling the Yukon River, Brooks hypothesized that construction of the dam would be catastrophic from an ecological and human standpoint, would cost an exorbitant amount of money, and that the claims of attracting industry and tourism to Alaska were greatly exaggerated.<ref>Brooks, pp. 53\u201359.</ref> In real terms, he estimated that construction of the dam would eliminate the habitat for 1.5 million ducks, 12,500 geese, 10,000 cranes, 270,000 salmon, 12,000 [[moose]], and seven percent of Alaska's fur-bearing animals.<ref>Brooks, p. 57.</ref> Similar articles appeared in magazines such as ''[[Field and Stream]]'', which called the project \"a catastrophe of major proportions\",<ref>Conley, Claire. \"Rampart Dam and the perpetual engineers\".

In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called [[Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye]], which lobbied against the project.<ref name=\"fast\"/> The ''[[Tundra Times]]'', an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly in opposition to the project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam.<ref name=\"Palmer2\"/> [[Don Young]], Alaska's representative to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], was elected to the [[Alaska Legislature]] in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.<ref name=\"Coates148\"/>\n\nA survey of the archeological and paleontological potential of the Yukon Flats, conducted in 1965, objected to the potential loss of the area. In part, it said, \"...&nbsp;it may be said that relatively speaking, the archaeological potential of the Rampart Impoundment area is great; the practical difficulties of field work will have to be overcome in order to obviate the possible loss of what may be some of the most important prehistoric records in North America.\"<ref>West, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government also strongly opposed the Rampart Dam project. According to the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]], signed in 1871, Canada was allowed free navigation of the Yukon River.<ref>W. Stewart Wallace, ed. ''The Encyclopedia of Canada'', Vol. VI.

Several United States congressmen and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]] protested the proposal on the grounds that the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.<ref name=\"Coates160\"/>\n\nIn his 1966 analysis of the project's economic feasibility, Michael Brewer refuted the conclusions of the 1962 federal study, saying that the ability of the dam to pay for itself was \"an exercise in speculation\".<ref name=\"Brewer2\"/> He also wrote that even if the dam was built and cheap electricity made available, \"Alaska did not possess a competitive advantage\".<ref name=\"Brewer3\">Brewer, p. 3</ref> He concluded by saying that the project was \"not economically efficient\".<ref name=\"Brewer3\"/> Because of arguments like these, the common belief among informed observers outside Alaska was that the project was designed to benefit Alaska alone, and thus could almost be considered \"foreign aid.\"<ref>Editorial.

Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving the natural beauty of a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. [[National Park Service]] in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well.<ref name=\"Coates158\">Coates, p. 158</ref> Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.<ref name=\"Coates158\"/>\n\nAmong Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project encouraged organization and the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline.

The project was planned for [[Rampart Canyon]] (also known as Rampart Gorge)  just {{convert|31|mi|km}} southwest of the village of [[Rampart, Alaska]] and about {{convert|105|mi|km}} west-northwest of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].\n\nThe resulting dam would have created a lake roughly the size of [[Lake Erie]], making it the largest man-made [[reservoir]] in the world. The plan for the dam itself called for a concrete structure {{convert|530|ft|0}} high with a top length of about {{convert|4700|ft|-1}}. The proposed power facilities would have consistently generated between 3.5 and 5 [[gigawatt]]s of electricity, based on the flow of the river as it differs between winter and summer.\n\nThough supported by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, the project was canceled after objections were raised. [[Alaska Natives|Native Alaskans]] in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the [[Yukon Flats]], a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of [[waterfowl]]. [[Fiscal conservatism|Fiscal conservatives]] opposed the dam on the grounds of its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.\n\nBecause of these objections, [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] formally opposed construction of the dam in 1967, and the project was shelved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nevertheless completed its engineering study of the project in 1971, and the final report was released to the public in 1979. In 1980, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] created the [[Yukon Flats National Wildlife Sanctuary]], which formally protected the area from development and disallowed any similar project.\n\n== Site ==\n[[Image:Rampart Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The northern portion of [[Rampart Canyon]] is seen in 1949.]]\nFrom its headwaters in the [[Coast Mountains]], the Yukon River flows northwest, across the Yukon\u2013Alaska border, until it intersects the [[Porcupine River]] at the settlement of [[Fort Yukon]]. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the [[Tanana River|Tanana]] and [[Koyukuk River|Koyukuk]] rivers before looping south, then north into [[Norton Sound]] in the [[Bering Sea]].<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District.

At that time, Sen. Gruening estimated that the project would cost roughly $1.2 billion  to complete.<ref name=\"start\"/>\n\nAs investigation and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers reached an agreement with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources.<ref>Stahr, Edward V. and Udall, Stewart. \"Memorandum of agreement\", U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Though only a part of the larger Department of the Interior study, the FWS report came down strongly opposed to the dam on the grounds that it would irrevocably destroy the Yukon Flats, a critical waterfowl breeding ground.<ref name=\"Coates148\">Coates, p. 148</ref> In January 1965, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] set aside almost {{convert|9000000|acre|-5}} of land for construction of the dam and reservoir.<ref>U.S. Department of the Interior. \"Rampart Canyon power site lands in Alaska classified\", U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service press release.

Spurr, dean of the Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an authority on forestry and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaska's projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (silver) salmon. It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats.  There would also have been a sharp decline in both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals:  muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurr's report noted: \"[It]is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the animal population supported by the inundated habitat.\"<ref>Rampart Dam and the Economic Development of Alaska (Ann Arbor: the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources, March 1966) at 49.</ref>\n\nIn March 1966 Spurr's team issued its final report, finding that the dam was not a cost-effective investment.<ref>See generally Stephen J. Spurr,  In Search of the Kuskokwim, and Other Great Endeavors: the Life and Times of J. Edward Spurr (Kenmore, Washington: Epicenter Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn January 1965, the Department of the Interior completed its three-volume, 1,000-page study of the Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies of the impact on the region's Alaska Native population.<ref>Department of the Interior.

That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ''Notice of Completion of Report on the Rampart Canyon Project.'' Washington, D.C. June 25, 1971.</ref> Because the construction season at the site is only five months,{{ref label|Note1|A|A}} the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades would be needed to build the dam and associated structures.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Preparation ===\nDue to the lack of any land transportation route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from [[Manley Hot Springs, Alaska|Eureka]], about {{convert|30|mi|0}} away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site.<ref name=\"p17\">Corps of Engineers, p. 17</ref> A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, [[Power station|powerhouse]], and other structures.<ref name=\"p17\"/> Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the [[cofferdam]]s needed to clear the Yukon River [[streambed]] for construction.<ref name=\"p17\"/> Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. D-3</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nSite clearing and foundation work would have been scheduled to begin after completion of the diversion work in the seventh year of the project. The first pouring of concrete was scheduled for the project's eighth year, and work on the powerhouse would have begun in the 11th year.<ref name=\"p17\"/> Owing to the large size of the reservoir, engineers estimated that the diversion tunnels would be closed in the 13th year, allowing construction to pace the filling of the new lake.<ref name=\"p17\"/> The reservoir would have reached a pool elevation of {{convert|550|ft|0}} in the 21st year, the dam would have been completed to elevation {{convert|660|ft|0}} in the 25th year, and the reservoir would have been filled to the full {{convert|640|ft|0|adj=on}} level in the 31st year after the project's start.<ref name=\"p17\"/> The installation of power generators was planned to follow as needed, with the last unit scheduled for installation by the 45th year of the project.<ref name=\"p17\"/>\n\nIn total, the dam would have consisted of a [[concrete]] gravity structure with a structural height of {{convert|510|ft|0}} and a [[hydraulic head|hydraulic height]] of {{convert|430|ft|0}}. At the elevation of {{convert|660|ft|0}}, the dam would have stretched for {{convert|4700|ft|-1}} from north to south. On the south bank would have been a concrete gravity [[spillway]] with a crest at elevation {{convert|600|ft|0}} and a maximum flow of {{convert|603000|ft3/s|-2}} at maximum pool elevation.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. D-1</ref> The power facilities would have consisted of twenty-two 266,000 kilowatt units and two 10,000 kilowatt service units.<ref>Corps of Engineers, pp. D-1, D-2</ref>\n\nMaterially, building the dam would have required {{convert|15000000|yd3|-4}} of concrete aggregate, {{convert|2900000|yd3|-4}} of rock fill, and another {{convert|1700000|yd3|-4}} of various other types of fill. Engineers suggested that some of the material could be found at the site, but the remainder would have to be brought from outside sources.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. 203</ref>\n\n=== Reservoir ===\nAt the projected pool elevation of {{convert|645|ft|0}}, the resulting reservoir would have had a total capacity of {{convert|1145000000|acre.ft|km3|-1|lk=in}}. The full pool length would have been about {{convert|270|mi|0}}, and the maximum width would have been {{convert|80|mi|0}}. The resulting lake would have had approximately 3,600 miles (5,800&nbsp;km) of shoreline and a total surface area of about {{convert|9844|sqmi|0}}.<ref name=\"d2\">Corps of Engineers, p. D-2</ref> Because the Yukon also is a transportation route, transshipment facilities were planned for below and above the dam site and would have been connected by road and rail links.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Because of the large size of the proposed reservoir and the need to allow some flow of the Yukon River downstream of the dam site for river navigation and fishing, engineers anticipated that filling the reservoir would take no fewer than 16 years to complete.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. B-23</ref>\n\n=== Anticipated costs ===\nThe Rampart Dam's large size had a correspondingly large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4&nbsp;million (1970 dollars) on construction of the physical dam alone, another $492&nbsp;million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39&nbsp;billion in total.<ref name=\"p18\">Corps of Engineers, p. 18</ref> That total included $15.59&nbsp;million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56&nbsp;million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7&nbsp;million for roads and bridges to access the area.<ref name=\"p18\"/> After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5&nbsp;million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2&nbsp;million for the maintenance of fish and wildlife facilities.<ref>Corps of Engineers, p. D-6</ref>\n\n== Weather effects ==\nFrom the initial planning stages, proponents and opponents speculated that the large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon.<ref name=\"Constnews\"/> Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, and most of the reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around [[Great Slave Lake]] and [[Lake Baikal]], both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of [[lake-effect snow]]. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.<ref>Streten, N.A.

Kennedy\u2014made campaign stops in Alaska. Both men gave their support to the Rampart Dam project, with Kennedy saying, \"I see the greatest dam in the free world at Rampart Canyon, producing twice the power of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] to light homes and mills and cities and farms all over Alaska.\"<ref>Kennedy, John F.

In 1960, Harold Moats of the Corps' Alaska district said, \"Rampart Canyon, the big one, is Alaska's most valuable resource, and as it is developed, Alaska will take her rightful place in the family of states contributing richly to the economy of the nation and the welfare of the whole free world.\"<ref name=\"Palmer2\">Palmer, p. 90</ref>\n\nIn early September 1963, a group of Alaska businesspeople, local government leaders, and industry representatives met at [[McKinley Park, Alaska|McKinley]] Park Lodge to organize lobbying efforts in favor of the dam. The resulting organization was called the Yukon Corporation for Power for America, later shortened to Yukon Power for America, Inc.<ref name=\"Yukon power\">Special to ''The New York Times''. \"Alaskans press big dam project\", ''The New York Times''.

Anthony Netboy, a [[salmon]] biologist employed by Yukon Power for America, claimed that one day, \"a housewife in Phoenix or L.A. will fry her eggs at breakfast with electricity generated on the far-off Yukon.\"<ref name=\"Coates160\">Coates, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Industrial argument ===\nSupporters of the project suggested that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as [[Aluminium production|aluminum smelting]], to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals.<ref>DRC, pp. 9, 20\u201324, and 79\u201396</ref> The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process the hundreds of millions of [[Board foot|board feet]] of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded.<ref>DRC, p. 96</ref> The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction\u2014not including jobs opened during the construction process.<ref name=\"DRC, pp. 102\u2013103\">DRC, pp. 102\u2013103</ref> Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.<ref name=\"DRC, pp. 102\u2013103\"/><ref>Brewer, p. 4</ref>\n\n=== Impact argument ===\nAt the time Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The [[1960 United States Census]] recorded just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, making it the least-populated state in the United States at that time.<ref>U.S. Census.

An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing \"not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world and it would be difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding.\"<ref name=\"Palmer2\"/> In a 1963 letter responding to a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article about the dam, Gruening wrote, <blockquote>As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam will give them ample gainful employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.<ref name=\"SI letter\">Gruening, Ernest.

Greuning stated that the project would be similar to [[Lake Powell]], in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including [[water skiing]] and [[picnic]]king.<ref>Gruening, Ernest. \"Speech to the Committee on Projects, National Rivers and Harbors Congress\". 52nd national convention, June 9, 1965.

The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative [[Susitna Hydroelectric Project]] to supply Alaska's electric needs.<ref>Weeden, Robert B. \"Conservation and Kilowatts\", ''Alaska Conservation Society News Bulletin 2''. May 1961. pp 3\u20135.</ref> This was followed in early 1961 by an [[Alaska Sportsmen's Council]] resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies of the impact of the project on fish and game stocks.<ref>Staff Report. \"Report on ASC's annual meeting\", ''Alaska Conservation Society News Bulletin 2''. January 1961. p. 6</ref> In April of that year, ''[[Alaska magazine|Alaska Sportsman]]'' magazine took a formal stand against the project.<ref>Coates, p. 140</ref>\n\nThe [[California Fish and Game Commission]] was among the first non-Alaska conservation groups to oppose construction of the dam, saying in 1963 that it would inundate the Yukon Flats, an area of wetlands that is among North America's largest waterfowl breeding grounds.<ref name=\"initreport\"/> Following that objection, other groups began to organize during the 1963 [[North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference]]. Fifteen conservation groups pooled a total of $25,000 at the meeting<ref name=\"Palmer\">Palmer, p. 91.</ref> to begin an independent scientific study of the project and start an opposition campaign.<ref>Vileisis, p. 230</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1964, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a report on the impact of dam construction on the Flats. The report strongly opposed construction of the dam, saying in part, \"Nowhere in the history of water development in North America have the fish and wildlife losses anticipated to result from a single project been so overwhelming.\"<ref name=\"controversyrage\"/> The report also pointed out the threat the dam would pose to the Yukon River's large salmon population, which swim upstream each year to spawn.<ref name=\"controversyrage\"/> [[Arthur Laing]], Canada's [[Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (Canada)|minister of northern affairs and natural resources]], also expressed alarm at the potential waterfowl losses and the threat the dam posed to Canada's portion of the Yukon River salmon population.<ref>Laing, Arthur. \"Waterfowl&mdash;A Resource in Danger\", 37th annual convention of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. Ottawa, Canada. February 19, 1965.</ref>\n\nA May 1965 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine by author Paul Brooks illustrated the growing protests of conservationists concerned about the project. After traveling the Yukon River, Brooks hypothesized that construction of the dam would be catastrophic from an ecological and human standpoint, would cost an exorbitant amount of money, and that the claims of attracting industry and tourism to Alaska were greatly exaggerated.<ref>Brooks, pp. 53\u201359.</ref> In real terms, he estimated that construction of the dam would eliminate the habitat for 1.5 million ducks, 12,500 geese, 10,000 cranes, 270,000 salmon, 12,000 [[moose]], and seven percent of Alaska's fur-bearing animals.<ref>Brooks, p. 57.</ref> Similar articles appeared in magazines such as ''[[Field and Stream]]'', which called the project \"a catastrophe of major proportions\",<ref>Conley, Claire. \"Rampart Dam and the perpetual engineers\". ''Field and Stream'', June 1966. pp. 34\u201336.</ref> and the ''[[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society Magazine]]'',  said the dam \"would negate 30 years of endeavor in waterfowl preservation.<ref>Leopold, A. and Leonard, Justin. \"Alaska dam would be resources disaster\".

''Northern Athabascan survival: Women, Community, and the Future''. University of Nebraska Press, 2002. p. 75.</ref> Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history.<ref name=\"fast\"/> Among the affected villages was [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]], which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called [[Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye]], which lobbied against the project.<ref name=\"fast\"/> The ''[[Tundra Times]]'', an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly in opposition to the project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam.<ref name=\"Palmer2\"/> [[Don Young]], Alaska's representative to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], was elected to the [[Alaska Legislature]] in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.<ref name=\"Coates148\"/>\n\nA survey of the archeological and paleontological potential of the Yukon Flats, conducted in 1965, objected to the potential loss of the area. In part, it said, \"...&nbsp;it may be said that relatively speaking, the archaeological potential of the Rampart Impoundment area is great; the practical difficulties of field work will have to be overcome in order to obviate the possible loss of what may be some of the most important prehistoric records in North America.\"<ref>West, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government also strongly opposed the Rampart Dam project. According to the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]], signed in 1871, Canada was allowed free navigation of the Yukon River.<ref>W. Stewart Wallace, ed. ''The Encyclopedia of Canada'', Vol. VI. Toronto, University Associates of Canada. 1948, pp. 259\u2013260.</ref> It was feared that construction of the dam would block navigation routes and violate the treaty.<ref>Coates, p. 150</ref>\n\n=== Financial objections ===\nOpposition to the dam project also arose in concern of the dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]] protested the proposal on the grounds that the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.<ref name=\"Coates160\"/>\n\nIn his 1966 analysis of the project's economic feasibility, Michael Brewer refuted the conclusions of the 1962 federal study, saying that the ability of the dam to pay for itself was \"an exercise in speculation\".<ref name=\"Brewer2\"/> He also wrote that even if the dam was built and cheap electricity made available, \"Alaska did not possess a competitive advantage\".<ref name=\"Brewer3\">Brewer, p. 3</ref> He concluded by saying that the project was \"not economically efficient\".<ref name=\"Brewer3\"/> Because of arguments like these, the common belief among informed observers outside Alaska was that the project was designed to benefit Alaska alone, and thus could almost be considered \"foreign aid.\"<ref>Editorial.

Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving the natural beauty of a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. [[National Park Service]] in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well.<ref name=\"Coates158\">Coates, p. 158</ref> Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.<ref name=\"Coates158\"/>\n\nAmong Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project encouraged organization and the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native land claims were recognized in the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] did the pipeline progress.<ref>Coates, pp. 160&ndash;161</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Renewable energy}}\n* [[List of reservoirs and dams of Alaska]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n* {{note label|Note1|A|A}}The Corps of Engineers defined the construction season as the period in which average temperatures at the site were above the freezing point of water.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Brewer, Michael.
