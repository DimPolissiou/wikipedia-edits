{"title_page": "Fundamental rights in India", "text_new": "{{short description|Inalienable rights guaranteed to People in India by its Constitution}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2019}}\n{{Indian Constitution TOC}}\n\n'''Fundamental rights''' are those rights which are essential for intellectual, moral and spiritual development of individuals. As these rights are fundamental or essential for existence and all-round development of individuals, hence, it's called as 'Fundamental' rights according to Navdeep Choudhary. These are enshrined in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of the [[Constitution of India]]. \n\nThese include individual rights common to most, such as, equality before the law, freedom of speech and freedom of expression\nReligious and cultural freedom, Freedom of assembly (peaceful assembly)\nFreedom of religion (freedom to practice religion), right to constitutional remedies for the protection of [[civil rights]] by means of [[writ]]s such as [[Habeas Corpus]], [[Mandamus]], [[Prohibition]], [[Certiorari]] and [[Quo Warranto]]. \n\nFundamental rights apply universally to all citizens, irrespective of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], birthplace, religion, [[caste]] or [[gender]]. The [[Indian Penal Code]] and other laws prescribe punishments for the violation of these rights, subject to the discretion of the [[judiciary]]. Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are also valid rights protected by the judiciary, in case of fundamental rights violations, the [[Supreme Court of India]] can be approached directly for ultimate justice as per Article 32. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]], the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]].\nThere are six fundamental rights recognised by the Indian constitution:\n\n# Right to [[Equality before the law|equality]](Articles. 14-18)\n# Right to [[Freedom]] (Articles. 19-22)\n# Right Against exploitation (Articles. 23-24)\n# Right to [[Freedom of Religion]] (Articles. 25-28)\n# Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles. 29-30), and\n# Right to [[Constitutional Remedies]] (Articles. 32-35)\n\n1. The '''right to equality''' includes equality before the law, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, gender or place of birth, equality of opportunity in matters of employment, the abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles.\n\n2. The '''right to freedom'''  includes [[freedom of speech and expression]], assembly, association or union or cooperatives, movement, residence, and right to practice any profession or occupation.\n\n3. The '''right against exploitation''' prohibits all forms of [[forced labour]], child labour and trafficking of human beings.\n\n4. The '''right to freedom of religion''' includes freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion, freedom to manage religious affairs, freedom from certain taxes and freedom from religious instructions in certain educational institutes. \n\n5. The '''Cultural and educational Rights''' preserve the right of any section of citizens to conserve their culture, language or script, and right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.\n\n6. The '''right to [[constitutional remedies]]''' is present for enforcement of fundamental rights. \n\nThe ''[[right to privacy]]'' is an intrinsic part of Article 21 (the Right to Freedom) that protects the life and liberty of the citizens.\n\nThe right to [[privacy]] is the newest right assured by the [[Supreme Court of India]]. It assures the people's data and [[personal security]]\n\nFundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of the Constitution of India.\n\n== Genesis ==\n\nThe development of such constitutionally guaranteed fundamental human rights in India was inspired by historical examples such as [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]] (1689), the [[United States Bill of Rights]] (approved on 17 September 1787, final ratification on 15 December 1791) and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (created during the [[French Revolution|revolution of 1789]], and ratified on 26 August 1789).<ref name=\"pgA23\">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-23</ref> \n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] signing the [[Constitution of India]] on 24 January 1950]] -->\n<!-- FAIR USE of Image: Jaw. Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg for rationale -->\n\nIn 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] gave extensive powers to the British government and police and allowed indefinite arrest and detention of individuals, warrantless searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to [[Non-Cooperation Movement|mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience]] throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland and the development of the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.\n\nIn 1928, the [[Nehru Report|Nehru Commission]] composing of representatives of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for [[dominion]] status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for religious and ethnic minorities, and limit the powers of the government. In 1931, the [[Indian National Congress]] (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the [[minimum wage]] and the abolition of [[untouchability]] and [[serfdom]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Gandhi\n | first = Rajmohan\n | title = Patel: A Life\n | page = 206\n}}</ref> Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.\n\nThe task of developing a constitution for the nation was undertaken by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], composing of elected representatives. The Constituent Assembly first met on 9 December 1946 under the presidency of Dr. Sachidanand. Later, [[Dr. Rajendra Prasad]] was made its president.

A notable development during that period having significant effect on the Indian constitution took place on 10 December 1948 when the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and called upon all member states to adopt these rights in their respective constitutions.\n\nThe fundamental rights were included in the First Draft Constitution (February 1948), the Second Draft Constitution (17 October 1948) and final Third Draft Constitution (26 November 1949), prepared by the [[Constitution of India#Drafting|Drafting Committee]].\n\n== Significance and characteristics ==\nThe fundamental rights were included in the constitution because they were considered essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity.

The [[President of India|President]] may by order suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of other rights as well.\n\n== Right to equality ==\nThe right to equality is an important right provided in [[s: Constitution of India/Part III|Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18\n\nof the constitution]]. It is the principal foundation of all other rights and liberties and guarantees the following:\n\n*Equality before the law: Article 14 of the constitution guarantees that all people shall be equally protected by the laws of the country. It means that the State<ref name=State/> will treat people in the same circumstances alike. This article also means that individuals, whether citizens of India or otherwise shall be treated differently if the circumstances are different.\n*Social equality and equal access to public areas: Article 15 of the constitution states that no citizen of India shall be discriminated on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every person shall have equal access to public places like public parks, museums, wells, bathing ghats, etc. However, the State may make any special provision for women and children. Special provisions may be made for the advancements of any socially or educationally backward class or [[scheduled castes]] or [[scheduled tribes]].\n*Equality in matters of public employment: Article 16 of the Constitution lays down that the State cannot discriminate against citizen in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs, however, there are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State to bring up the weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the ''Citizenship (Amendment) Bill'', 2003, this right shall not be conferred to [[Overseas Citizenship of India|Overseas citizens of India]].<ref name=\"OCI\"/>\n*Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the constitution abolishes the practice of untouchability. The practice of untouchability is an offence and anyone doing so is punishable by law.

The government restricts these freedoms in the interest of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, the right to life and personal liberty cannot be suspended.

Begar practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Human trafficking for the purpose of the slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military conscription is covered by this provision.\n\n== Right to freedom of religion ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Religion in India]] -->\nRight to freedom of religion, covered in Articles 25, 26, 27 and 28, provides [[religious freedom]] to all citizens of India. The objective of this right is to sustain the principle of [[secularism]] in India. According to the Constitution, all religions are equal before the State and no religion shall be given preference over the other. Citizens are free to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice.\n\nReligious communities can set up charitable institutions of their own. However, activities in such institutions that are not religious are performed according to the laws laid down by the government. Establishing a charitable institution can also be restricted in the interest of public order, morality, and health. No person shall be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of a particular religion. A state-run institution cannot impart education that is pro-religion. Also, nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any further law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity that may be associated with religious practice, or providing for social welfare and reform.\n\n== Right to life ==\nThe constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which in turn cites specific provisions in which these rights are applied and enforced:\n\n*Protection with respect to a conviction for offences is guaranteed in the right to life and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what the law of the land prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Compulsion in this article refers to what in law is called [[duress]] (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self-incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of [[double jeopardy]], that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo-Saxon law. This principle was first established in the [[Magna Carta]].\n*Protection of life and personal liberty is also stated under the right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law. This means that a person's life and personal liberty can be disputed only if that person has committed a crime. However, the [[right to life]] does not include the [[right to die]] and hence, suicide or any attempt thereof, was an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nandan G |title=Indian grants right to suicide |journal=BMJ |volume=308 |issue=6941 |page=1392 |date=May 1994 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6941/1392 |doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6941.1392 |access-date=15 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521193439/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6941/1392 |archive-date=21 May 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1996, another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one.<ref>[http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/papers/paper003.html Paper 3: Abolition and Restoration of Section 309 IPC \u2013 an overview by BR Sharma, A Sharma, D Harish: Anil Aggrawal's Internet Journal of Forensic Medicine: Vol. 7, No. 1 (January \u2013 June 2006)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072104/http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/papers/paper003.html |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref> But with the passage of the Mental Healthcare Bill 2017, attempted suicide has been decriminalised.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mental-health-bill-decriminalising-suicide-passed-by-parliament/|title=Mental health bill decriminalising suicide passed by Parliament|date=2017-03-27|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327160250/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mental-health-bill-decriminalising-suicide-passed-by-parliament/|archive-date=27 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Personal liberty\" includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms).

No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also, an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest [[magistrate]] within 24 hours. The rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the ''Preventive Detention Act''. Under [[preventive detention]], the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.\n\n== Cultural and educational rights ==\nThe constitution of India guarantees every single citizen of India has both rights to education and [[culture of India|cultures]]. The Constitution also provides special measures, to protect the rights of the minorities. Any community that has a language and a script of its own has the right to conserve and develop it. No citizen can be discriminated against for admission in the state or state-aided institutions.\n\nAll minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own educational institutions to preserve and develop their own culture. In granting aid to institutions, the state cannot discriminate against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a minority institution. The right to administer does not mean that the state cannot interfere in case of maladministration. \n\nIn a precedent-setting judgment in 1980, the Supreme Court held that the state can take regulatory measures to promote the efficiency and excellence of educational standards. It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgment delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could be only through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission.\n\n== Right to constitutional remedies ==\nRight to constitutional remedies (Articles 32 to 35) empowers the citizens to move to a court of law in case of any denial of the fundamental rights. For instance, in case of imprisonment, any citizen can ask the court to see if it is according to the provisions of the law of the country by lodging a [[Public interest litigation in India|public interest litigation]]. If the court finds that it is not, the person must be freed. This procedure of asking the courts to preserve or safeguard the citizen's fundamental rights can be done in various ways. The courts can issue various kinds of [[Writs#Indian law|writs]] protecting the rights of the citizens. These writs are:\n*[[habeas corpus]]\n*[[mandamus]]\n*[[Writ of Prohibition]]\n*[[quo warranto]]\n*[[certiorari]]\n\nThis allows a citizen to move to court if they believe that any of their Fundamental Rights have been violated by the state. Article 32 is also called the citizens right to protect and defend the constitution as it can be used by the citizens to enforce the constitution through the judiciary. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar declared the right to constitutional remedies \"the heart and soul\" of the Indian constitution. When a national or state emergency is declared, this right is suspended by the central government         \n\n\nThe right to '''[[constitutional remedies]]''' is present for enforcement of fundamental rights.\n\nThe ''right to privacy'' is an intrinsic part of Article 21 (the Right to Freedom) that protects the life and liberty of the citizens.\n\nThe right to [[privacy]] is the newest right assured by the [[Supreme Court of India]]. It assures the people's data and [[personal security]]\n\nFundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of the Constitution of India\n\n==Right to privacy==\nThe right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.

The provisions of acts like the [[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]] (MISA), Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the [[National Security Act (India)|National Security Act]] (NSA) are a means of countering the fundamental rights, because they sanction excessive powers with the aim of fighting internal and [[cross-border terrorism]] and political violence, without safeguards for [[civil rights]].<ref name=\"pgA33\"/> The phrases \"security of State\", \"public order\" and \"morality\" are of wide implication.

They were made permanent and sacrosanct reversing the Supreme Court's earlier decision which had upheld Parliament's power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to fundamental rights. Up until the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|24th constitutional amendment]] in 1971, the fundamental rights given to the people were permanent and can not be repealed or diluted by the Parliament. The 24th constitutional amendment introduced a new [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Article 13(4)]] enabling Parliament to legislate on the subjects of [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Part III of the constitution]] using its constituent powers per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368 (1)]]. In 1973, the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|13 member constitutional bench]] of the Supreme Court also upheld with majority the validity of the 24th constitutional amendment. However, it ruled that the [[Basic structure doctrine|basic structure of the constitution]] which is built on the basic foundation representing the dignity and freedom of the individual, can not be altered. This is of supreme importance and cannot be destroyed by any form of amendment to the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/|title=Paras 316 and 317 of Kesavananda Bharati v.

Thus fundamental rights given in [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Part III]] are not equally applicable in each state /region and can be made different by making additions/deletions to Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review for the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule. Apex court also stated it shall examine laws included in the Ninth Schedule after 1973 for any incompatibility with the basic structure doctrine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/IX-Schedule-laws-open-to-review/article14705323.ece|title=IX Schedule laws open to review|year=2007|accessdate=21 October 2017|newspaper=The Hindu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001010818/https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/IX-Schedule-laws-open-to-review/article14705323.ece|archive-date=1 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Amendment to Article 31C===\nSection 4 of the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|42nd Amendment]], had changed [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Article 31C]] of the constitution to accord precedence to the [[Directive Principles]] [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of India|(earlier applicable only to clauses b & c of Article 39)]] over the fundamental rights of individuals.

Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Article 31 provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes.\n\nThe provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The [[Forty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|44th Amendment]] of 1978 removed the right to property from the list of fundamental rights.<ref name=\"44amact\">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm 44th Amendment Act, 1978] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824065839/https://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm |date=24 August 2018 }}.</ref> A new provision, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\". Thus, if a legislator makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the state to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right.

As these rights are fundamental or essential for existence and all-round development of individuals, hence, it's called as 'Fundamental' rights according to Navdeep Choudhary. These are enshrined in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of the [[Constitution of India]]. \n\nThese include individual rights common to most, such as, equality before the law, freedom of speech and freedom of expression\nReligious and cultural freedom, Freedom of assembly (peaceful assembly)\nFreedom of religion (freedom to practice religion), right to constitutional remedies for the protection of [[civil rights]] by means of [[writ]]s such as [[Habeas Corpus]], [[Mandamus]], [[Prohibition]], [[Certiorari]] and [[Quo Warranto]]. \n\nFundamental rights apply universally to all citizens, irrespective of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], birthplace, religion, [[caste]] or [[gender]]. The [[Indian Penal Code]] and other laws prescribe punishments for the violation of these rights, subject to the discretion of the [[judiciary]]. Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are also valid rights protected by the judiciary, in case of fundamental rights violations, the [[Supreme Court of India]] can be approached directly for ultimate justice as per Article 32. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]], the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]].\nThere are six fundamental rights recognised by the Indian constitution:\n\n# Right to [[Equality before the law|equality]](Articles. 14-18)\n# Right to [[Freedom]] (Articles. 19-22)\n# Right Against exploitation (Articles. 23-24)\n# Right to [[Freedom of Religion]] (Articles. 25-28)\n# Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles. 29-30), and\n# Right to [[Constitutional Remedies]] (Articles. 32-35)\n\n1. The '''right to equality''' includes equality before the law, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, gender or place of birth, equality of opportunity in matters of employment, the abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles.\n\n2. The '''right to freedom'''  includes [[freedom of speech and expression]], assembly, association or union or cooperatives, movement, residence, and right to practice any profession or occupation.\n\n3. The '''right against exploitation''' prohibits all forms of [[forced labour]], child labour and trafficking of human beings.\n\n4. The '''right to freedom of religion''' includes freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion, freedom to manage religious affairs, freedom from certain taxes and freedom from religious instructions in certain educational institutes. \n\n5. The '''Cultural and educational Rights''' preserve the right of any section of citizens to conserve their culture, language or script, and right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.\n\n6. The '''right to [[constitutional remedies]]''' is present for enforcement of fundamental rights. \n\nThe ''[[right to privacy]]'' is an intrinsic part of Article 21 (the Right to Freedom) that protects the life and liberty of the citizens.\n\nThe right to [[privacy]] is the newest right assured by the [[Supreme Court of India]]. It assures the people's data and [[personal security]]\n\nFundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of the Constitution of India.\n\n== Genesis ==\n\nThe development of such constitutionally guaranteed fundamental human rights in India was inspired by historical examples such as [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]] (1689), the [[United States Bill of Rights]] (approved on 17 September 1787, final ratification on 15 December 1791) and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (created during the [[French Revolution|revolution of 1789]], and ratified on 26 August 1789).<ref name=\"pgA23\">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A.

Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg for rationale -->\n\nIn 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] gave extensive powers to the British government and police and allowed indefinite arrest and detention of individuals, warrantless searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to [[Non-Cooperation Movement|mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience]] throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland and the development of the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.\n\nIn 1928, the [[Nehru Report|Nehru Commission]] composing of representatives of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for [[dominion]] status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for religious and ethnic minorities, and limit the powers of the government. In 1931, the [[Indian National Congress]] (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the [[minimum wage]] and the abolition of [[untouchability]] and [[serfdom]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Gandhi\n | first = Rajmohan\n | title = Patel: A Life\n | page = 206\n}}</ref> Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.\n\nThe task of developing a constitution for the nation was undertaken by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], composing of elected representatives. The Constituent Assembly first met on 9 December 1946 under the presidency of Dr. Sachidanand. Later, [[Dr. Rajendra Prasad]] was made its president. While members of Congress composed of a large majority, Congress leaders appointed persons from diverse political backgrounds to responsibilities of developing the constitution and national laws.<ref name=\"constitution\">{{cite web\n| last = UNI\n| authorlink = United News of India\n| url = http://www.rediff.com/freedom/22patel.htm\n| title = Sardar Patel was the real architect of the Constitution\n| publisher = [[Rediff.com]]\n| accessdate = 15 May 2006\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505154446/http://www.rediff.com/freedom/22patel.htm\n| archive-date = 5 May 2006\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref> Notably, [[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]] became the chairperson of the drafting committee, while [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] became chairpersons of committees and sub-committees responsible for different subjects. A notable development during that period having significant effect on the Indian constitution took place on 10 December 1948 when the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and called upon all member states to adopt these rights in their respective constitutions.\n\nThe fundamental rights were included in the First Draft Constitution (February 1948), the Second Draft Constitution (17 October 1948) and final Third Draft Constitution (26 November 1949), prepared by the [[Constitution of India#Drafting|Drafting Committee]].\n\n== Significance and characteristics ==\nThe fundamental rights were included in the constitution because they were considered essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity. The writers of the constitution regarded democracy of no avail if civil liberties, like freedom of speech and religion were not recognised and protected by the State.<ref name=State>The term \"State\" includes all authorities within the territory of India. It includes the [[Government of India]], the [[Parliament of India]], the Government and legislature of the [[states of India]].

For this purpose, the constitution guaranteed to all the citizens of India the freedom of speech and expression and various other freedoms in the form of the fundamental rights.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Laski\n | first = Harold Joseph\n | authorlink = Harold Laski\n | year = 1930\n | title = Liberty in the Modern State\n | publisher = Harpers and Brothers\n | location = New York and London\n}}</ref>\n\nAll people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have been given the right to petition directly the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] or the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] for the enforcement of their fundamental rights.

Some fundamental rights apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion.

These provisions act as a check both on state action as well as the action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled<ref>''[[Kesavananda Bharati vs. The State of Kerala]]''; AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225 \u2013 In what became famously known as the \"Fundamental Rights case\", the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decided that the basic structure of the [[Constitution of India]] was unamendable</ref> that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a [[Amendment of the Constitution of India|constitutional amendment]], their inclusion is a check not only on the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] but also on the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] and state legislatures.<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-24</ref>\n\nA [[State of Emergency in India|state of national emergency]] has an adverse effect on these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. The [[President of India|President]] may by order suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of other rights as well.\n\n== Right to equality ==\nThe right to equality is an important right provided in [[s: Constitution of India/Part III|Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18\n\nof the constitution]]. It is the principal foundation of all other rights and liberties and guarantees the following:\n\n*Equality before the law: Article 14 of the constitution guarantees that all people shall be equally protected by the laws of the country. It means that the State<ref name=State/> will treat people in the same circumstances alike. This article also means that individuals, whether citizens of India or otherwise shall be treated differently if the circumstances are different.\n*Social equality and equal access to public areas: Article 15 of the constitution states that no citizen of India shall be discriminated on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every person shall have equal access to public places like public parks, museums, wells, bathing ghats, etc. However, the State may make any special provision for women and children. Special provisions may be made for the advancements of any socially or educationally backward class or [[scheduled castes]] or [[scheduled tribes]].\n*Equality in matters of public employment: Article 16 of the Constitution lays down that the State cannot discriminate against citizen in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs, however, there are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State to bring up the weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the ''Citizenship (Amendment) Bill'', 2003, this right shall not be conferred to [[Overseas Citizenship of India|Overseas citizens of India]].<ref name=\"OCI\"/>\n*Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the constitution abolishes the practice of untouchability. The practice of untouchability is an offence and anyone doing so is punishable by law. The ''Untouchability Offences Act'' of 1955 (renamed to ''Protection of Civil Rights Act'' in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Bratnal.jpg|thumb|100px|''Bharat Ratna'' medallion.]] -->\n*Abolition of Titles: Article 18 of the constitution prohibits the State from conferring any titles. \"Citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign State. The British government had created an aristocratic class known as ''Rai Bahadurs'' and ''Khan Bahadurs'' in India \u2013 these titles were also abolished. However, [[Military rank|Military]] and [[Academic rank|academic]] distinctions can be conferred on the citizens of India.

It is a cluster of four main laws. The right to freedom in Article 19 guarantees the following six freedoms: all people have the right to go anywhere in their country.\n\n*Freedom of speech and expression, on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1218090/ |title=Article 19 in The Constitution Of India 1949 |publisher=Indiankanoon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208104425/http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1218090/ |archive-date=8 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*Freedom to assemble peacefully without arms on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order and the sovereignty and integrity of India.\n*Freedom to form associations or unions or co-operative societies on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality and the sovereignty and integrity of India.\n*Citizens have the freedom to move freely throughout India, although reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the public's interest. For example, to control an epidemic, restrictions on movement and travel can be imposed.\n*Freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India, subject to reasonable restrictions by the State in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the [[scheduled tribes]] because certain safeguards as are envisaged here seem to be justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion.<ref name=\"MVPylee\">{{cite book\n | last = Pylee | first = M.V. | year = 1999\n | title = India's Constitution\n | publisher = S.

Also, professional or technical qualifications may be prescribed for practising any profession or carrying on any trade.\n\nArticle 20 gives protection in respect of conviction for offences.\n\nArticle 21 gives the right to life, personal liberty and the right to die with dignity (passive euthanasia).\n\nArticle 21A gives free education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years such manner as the State may, by law, determine.\n\nArticle 22: Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.\n\nThe constitution also imposes restrictions on these rights. The government restricts these freedoms in the interest of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, the right to life and personal liberty cannot be suspended. The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.\n\nCourts in India have mandated that some of these rights are applicable to non-human entitles which have been given the status of the \"[[Legal_person#india|legal person]]\" and humans have the [[Duty#Legal_duties|legal duty]] to act as \"[[In loco parentis|loco parentis]]\" towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children ([[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] in 2018 [[Cattle_theft_in_India#Cattle_smuggling_in_India|cow-smuggling]] case), a [[deity]] as a legal person is entitled to the rights (Supreme Court in 2018 [[entry of women to Sabarimala]] granted Lord [[Ayyappan]] right to privacy), rivers are legal person ([[Uttarakhand High Court]] mandated that the river [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] have right to be protected against pollution caused by humans).<ref name=IndiaLaw>[https://qz.com/india/1636326/who-apart-from-human-beings-are-legal-persons-in-india/ Birds to holy rivers: A list of everything India considers \u201clegal persons\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109082418/https://qz.com/india/1636326/who-apart-from-human-beings-are-legal-persons-in-india/ |date=9 November 2019 }}, [[Quartz (publication)]], September 2019.</ref>\n\n===Right to information (RTI)===\n\n[[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to information]] has been given the status of a fundamental right under Article 19(1) of the Constitution in 2005.

Begar practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Human trafficking for the purpose of the slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military conscription is covered by this provision.\n\n== Right to freedom of religion ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Religion in India]] -->\nRight to freedom of religion, covered in Articles 25, 26, 27 and 28, provides [[religious freedom]] to all citizens of India. The objective of this right is to sustain the principle of [[secularism]] in India. According to the Constitution, all religions are equal before the State and no religion shall be given preference over the other. Citizens are free to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice.\n\nReligious communities can set up charitable institutions of their own. However, activities in such institutions that are not religious are performed according to the laws laid down by the government. Establishing a charitable institution can also be restricted in the interest of public order, morality, and health. No person shall be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of a particular religion. A state-run institution cannot impart education that is pro-religion. Also, nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any further law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity that may be associated with religious practice, or providing for social welfare and reform.\n\n== Right to life ==\nThe constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which in turn cites specific provisions in which these rights are applied and enforced:\n\n*Protection with respect to a conviction for offences is guaranteed in the right to life and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what the law of the land prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Compulsion in this article refers to what in law is called [[duress]] (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self-incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of [[double jeopardy]], that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo-Saxon law. This principle was first established in the [[Magna Carta]].\n*Protection of life and personal liberty is also stated under the right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law. This means that a person's life and personal liberty can be disputed only if that person has committed a crime. However, the [[right to life]] does not include the [[right to die]] and hence, suicide or any attempt thereof, was an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nandan G |title=Indian grants right to suicide |journal=BMJ |volume=308 |issue=6941 |page=1392 |date=May 1994 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6941/1392 |doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6941.1392 |access-date=15 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521193439/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6941/1392 |archive-date=21 May 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1996, another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one.<ref>[http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/papers/paper003.html Paper 3: Abolition and Restoration of Section 309 IPC \u2013 an overview by BR Sharma, A Sharma, D Harish: Anil Aggrawal's Internet Journal of Forensic Medicine: Vol. 7, No. 1 (January \u2013 June 2006)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072104/http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/papers/paper003.html |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref> But with the passage of the Mental Healthcare Bill 2017, attempted suicide has been decriminalised.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mental-health-bill-decriminalising-suicide-passed-by-parliament/|title=Mental health bill decriminalising suicide passed by Parliament|date=2017-03-27|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327160250/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mental-health-bill-decriminalising-suicide-passed-by-parliament/|archive-date=27 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Personal liberty\" includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms).

No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also, an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest [[magistrate]] within 24 hours. The rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the ''Preventive Detention Act''. Under [[preventive detention]], the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.\n\n== Cultural and educational rights ==\nThe constitution of India guarantees every single citizen of India has both rights to education and [[culture of India|cultures]]. The Constitution also provides special measures, to protect the rights of the minorities. Any community that has a language and a script of its own has the right to conserve and develop it. No citizen can be discriminated against for admission in the state or state-aided institutions.\n\nAll minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own educational institutions to preserve and develop their own culture. In granting aid to institutions, the state cannot discriminate against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a minority institution. The right to administer does not mean that the state cannot interfere in case of maladministration. \n\nIn a precedent-setting judgment in 1980, the Supreme Court held that the state can take regulatory measures to promote the efficiency and excellence of educational standards. It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgment delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could be only through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission.\n\n== Right to constitutional remedies ==\nRight to constitutional remedies (Articles 32 to 35) empowers the citizens to move to a court of law in case of any denial of the fundamental rights. For instance, in case of imprisonment, any citizen can ask the court to see if it is according to the provisions of the law of the country by lodging a [[Public interest litigation in India|public interest litigation]]. If the court finds that it is not, the person must be freed. This procedure of asking the courts to preserve or safeguard the citizen's fundamental rights can be done in various ways. The courts can issue various kinds of [[Writs#Indian law|writs]] protecting the rights of the citizens. These writs are:\n*[[habeas corpus]]\n*[[mandamus]]\n*[[Writ of Prohibition]]\n*[[quo warranto]]\n*[[certiorari]]\n\nThis allows a citizen to move to court if they believe that any of their Fundamental Rights have been violated by the state. Article 32 is also called the citizens right to protect and defend the constitution as it can be used by the citizens to enforce the constitution through the judiciary. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar declared the right to constitutional remedies \"the heart and soul\" of the Indian constitution. When a national or state emergency is declared, this right is suspended by the central government         \n\n\nThe right to '''[[constitutional remedies]]''' is present for enforcement of fundamental rights.\n\nThe ''right to privacy'' is an intrinsic part of Article 21 (the Right to Freedom) that protects the life and liberty of the citizens.\n\nThe right to [[privacy]] is the newest right assured by the [[Supreme Court of India]]. It assures the people's data and [[personal security]]\n\nFundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of the Constitution of India\n\n==Right to privacy==\nThe right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. It protects the inner sphere of the individual from interference from both state, and non-state actors and allows individuals to make autonomous life choices.

Political and other groups have demanded that the [[right to work]], the right to economic assistance in case of unemployment, old age, and similar rights be enshrined as constitutional guarantees to address issues of poverty and economic insecurity,<ref name=\"pgA33\"/> though these provisions have been enshrined in the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India#Directive Principles of State Policy|directive principles of state policy]].<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 41 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The right to freedom and personal liberty has a number of limiting clauses, and thus has been criticised for failing to check the sanctioning of powers often deemed \"excessive\".<ref name=\"pgA33\"/> There is also the provision of preventive detention and suspension of fundamental rights in times of [[State of Emergency in India|emergency]]. The provisions of acts like the [[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]] (MISA), Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the [[National Security Act (India)|National Security Act]] (NSA) are a means of countering the fundamental rights, because they sanction excessive powers with the aim of fighting internal and [[cross-border terrorism]] and political violence, without safeguards for [[civil rights]].<ref name=\"pgA33\"/> The phrases \"security of State\", \"public order\" and \"morality\" are of wide implication.

In nutshell, India is its people not its land as enshrined in its constitution.\n\nSince [[speedy trial]] is not the constitutional right of the citizens, the cases involving violations of fundamental rights take inordinate time for resolution by the Supreme Court which is against the [[legal maxim]] '[[justice delayed is justice denied]]'.<ref>{{cite web|title=What causes judicial delay?

This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. However, the number of members voting in support of the amendment shall not be less than the [[majority|absolute majority]] of the total members of a house \u2013 whether the [[Lok Sabha]] or [[Rajya Sabha]].\n\n==Fundamental rights not sacrosanct==\nWhile deciding the [[I.C. Golaknath and Ors. vs State of Punjab and Anrs.|Golaknath case]] in February 1967, Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament has no power to curtail the fundamental rights. They were made permanent and sacrosanct reversing the Supreme Court's earlier decision which had upheld Parliament's power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to fundamental rights. Up until the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|24th constitutional amendment]] in 1971, the fundamental rights given to the people were permanent and can not be repealed or diluted by the Parliament. The 24th constitutional amendment introduced a new [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Article 13(4)]] enabling Parliament to legislate on the subjects of [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Part III of the constitution]] using its constituent powers per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368 (1)]]. In 1973, the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|13 member constitutional bench]] of the Supreme Court also upheld with majority the validity of the 24th constitutional amendment. However, it ruled that the [[Basic structure doctrine|basic structure of the constitution]] which is built on the basic foundation representing the dignity and freedom of the individual, can not be altered. This is of supreme importance and cannot be destroyed by any form of amendment to the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/|title=Paras 316 and 317 of Kesavananda Bharati v.

Article 31B says that any acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule of the constitution by the Parliament can override the fundamental rights and such laws cannot be repealed or made void by the judiciary on the grounds of violating fundamental rights. Thus fundamental rights given in [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Part III]] are not equally applicable in each state /region and can be made different by making additions/deletions to Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review for the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule. Apex court also stated it shall examine laws included in the Ninth Schedule after 1973 for any incompatibility with the basic structure doctrine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/IX-Schedule-laws-open-to-review/article14705323.ece|title=IX Schedule laws open to review|year=2007|accessdate=21 October 2017|newspaper=The Hindu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001010818/https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/IX-Schedule-laws-open-to-review/article14705323.ece|archive-date=1 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Amendment to Article 31C===\nSection 4 of the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|42nd Amendment]], had changed [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Article 31C]] of the constitution to accord precedence to the [[Directive Principles]] [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of India|(earlier applicable only to clauses b & c of Article 39)]] over the fundamental rights of individuals. In [[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]] case, the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment to Article 31C is not valid and [[ultra vires]].\n\n=== Right to property ===\nThe Constitution originally provided for the [[right to property]] under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Article 31 provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes.\n\nThe provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The [[Forty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|44th Amendment]] of 1978 removed the right to property from the list of fundamental rights.<ref name=\"44amact\">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm 44th Amendment Act, 1978] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824065839/https://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm |date=24 August 2018 }}.</ref> A new provision, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\". Thus, if a legislator makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the state to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens.<ref name=\"pgA33\">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A.

Children, who had either dropped out of schools or never been to any educational institution, will get elementary education as it will be binding on the part of the local and state governments to ensure that all children in the 6\u201314 age group get schooling. As per the Act, private educational institutions should reserve 25 percent seats for children from the weaker sections of society. The centre and the states have agreed to share the financial burden in the ratio of 55:45, while the Finance Commission has given Rs.250&nbsp;billion to the States for implementing the Act. The Centre has approved an outlay of Rs.150&nbsp;billion for 2010\u20132011.\n\nThe school management committee or the local authority will identify the drop-outs or out-of-school children aged above six and admit them in classes appropriate to their age after giving special training.\n\n{{Wikisource|Constitution of India/Part III}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Lawmaking procedure in India]]\n* [[President's rule]]\n* [[President of India]]\n* [[Federalism in India]]\n* [[Part I of the Constitution of India]]\n* [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n* [[List of Acts of the Parliament of India]]\n* [[Secularism]]\n* [[The Constitution of India]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{ Navboxes\n|list ={{Government of India}}\n}}\n\n== Link of webpage ==\n* [http://pdfinhindi.com/download-indian-constitution-in-hindi-pdf/ Article in ''Indian Constitution In Hindi'']\n* [https://www.govjobportal.net/2018/10/indian-polity-in-hindi.html ''Indian Constitution In Hindi'']\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fundamental Rights In India}}\n[[Category:Constitution of India]]\n[[Category:National human rights instruments]]\n[[Category:Human rights in India]]\n", "name_user": "Ishani217", "label": "safe", "comment": "Complete definition of 'The State' as described in Indian Constitution.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights_in_India"}

G. Chitale, was an ordinary milk businessman located in a small village of Limb Gaon situated in the [[Satara district|Satara]] district of Maharashtra. Due to an unexpected turn of events, his cattle fell prey to an unknown disease resulting in their death. This caused a major loss in the business owned by the Chitale Family.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://indiasuccessstories.com/view_story/Evolution-of-Chitale-Bhandhu-Sweet-Mart-|title=Evolution of Chitale Bhandhu Sweet Mart|last=Chitale|first=Shrikrishna|website=India Success Stories|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> In 1939, with a fresh start B. G. Chitale founded the Chitale Group of industries by starting their first enterprise, Chitale Dairy. The brand quickly gained reputation for its quality after it expanded its reach after Raghunath Rao Chitale (Also known as Bhau Chitale; Son of B. G. Chitale) set up a shop in [[Mumbai|Mumbai, Maharashtra]] in a partnership.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the year 1946, the partnership came to an end and Raghunath Rao Chitale had to leave Mumbai. He then moved to Pune and started vending milk supplied to him from [[Bhiwandi]]. The business became a success in the city and in the year 1950 he bought a 500 [[Square foot|square feet]] shop where he set up a new enterprise, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The shop is still operational and is now considered the headquarters of Chitale Bandhu.\n\n=== Introduction to Bakarwadi ===\nChitale Bandhu started the sale of [[bakarwadi]] in 1970. Due to the growth of demand, the enterprise then installed machines to maintain the original shape and size of the bakarwadi.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early nineties, the bhakarwadi sale was around {{cvt|300|kg}} a day.<ref name=\":0\" /> Currently, the enterprise sells about {{cvt|3000|kg}} of the snack daily. Introduction of bakarwadi in Chitale Bandhu's shop increased the sales of the enterprise to a great extent.<ref name=\":2\" /> This growing demand for the new snack was fulfilled after B. G. Chitale's toured Japan in the 1970s. With the new innovations and technology, the enterprise adopted a semi-automatic production of bakarwadi in 1989.<ref name=\":2\" /> Later, the production was made completely automatic. This allowed the enterprise to grow faster. In the following years Chitale Bandhu started opening multiple branches around the city of Pune.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Computerized billing system ===\nIn 1985, the enterprise installed a computerized billing system.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Products ==\n\n=== Snacks and namkeen ===\nChitale Bandhu Mithaiwale has over 40 varieties of Namkeen sold at multiple outlets. Some of the common and widely sold Namkeen include: [[bakarwadi]], various [[Bombay mix|Chivda]], [[Farsan (food)|Farsan]], Gathi, Papadi, various [[Sev (food)|sev]], and [[Shankarpali]]. Along with these there are also multiple [[chaat]] products such as [[Samosa]] and [[Kachori]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flavorsofmycity.com/chitale-bandhu-mithaiwale|title=Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale - Pune (MH) - Shop By Cities :Flavors of My City|website=www.flavorsofmycity.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dineout.co.in/pune/chitale-bandhu-mithaiwale-deccan-gymkhana-west-pune-15688/menu|title=Menu of Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale, Deccan Gymkhana, Pune {{!}} Dineout discovery|website=www.dineout.co.in|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==== Bakarwadi ====\nChitale Bandhu has been known for selling [[bakarwadi]] since the early 1970s. Although this snack was originally made in [[Gujarat]], it gained popularity in Maharashtra when it was introduced (Many believe that this is due to its spice which is common in Maharashtra).<ref name=\":2\" /> Many sources, such as NDTV foods, believe that although the enterprise was performing well in the sweets sector, after the introduction of [[bakarwadi]] in the menu, its sales increased rapidly.

G. Chitale, was an ordinary milk businessman located in a small village of Limb Gaon situated in the [[Satara district|Satara]] district of Maharashtra. Due to an unexpected turn of events, his cattle fell prey to an unknown disease resulting in their death. This caused a major loss in the business owned by the Chitale Family.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://indiasuccessstories.com/view_story/Evolution-of-Chitale-Bhandhu-Sweet-Mart-|title=Evolution of Chitale Bhandhu Sweet Mart|last=Chitale|first=Shrikrishna|website=India Success Stories|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> In 1939, with a fresh start B. G. Chitale founded the Chitale Group of industries by starting their first enterprise, Chitale Dairy. The brand quickly gained reputation for its quality after it expanded its reach after Raghunath Rao Chitale (Also known as Bhau Chitale; Son of B. G. Chitale) set up a shop in [[Mumbai|Mumbai, Maharashtra]] in a partnership.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the year 1946, the partnership came to an end and Raghunath Rao Chitale had to leave Mumbai. He then moved to Pune and started vending milk supplied to him from [[Bhiwandi]]. The business became a success in the city and in the year 1950 he bought a 500 [[Square foot|square feet]] shop where he set up a new enterprise, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The shop is still operational and is now considered the headquarters of Chitale Bandhu.\n\n=== Introduction to Bakarwadi ===\nChitale Bandhu started the sale of [[bakarwadi]] in 1970. Due to the growth of demand, the enterprise then installed machines to maintain the original shape and size of the bakarwadi.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early nineties, the bhakarwadi sale was around {{cvt|300|kg}} a day.<ref name=\":0\" /> Currently, the enterprise sells about {{cvt|3000|kg}} of the snack daily. Introduction of bakarwadi in Chitale Bandhu's shop increased the sales of the enterprise to a great extent.<ref name=\":2\" /> This growing demand for the new snack was fulfilled after B. G. Chitale's toured Japan in the 1970s. With the new innovations and technology, the enterprise adopted a semi-automatic production of bakarwadi in 1989.<ref name=\":2\" /> Later, the production was made completely automatic. This allowed the enterprise to grow faster. In the following years Chitale Bandhu started opening multiple branches around the city of Pune.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Computerized billing system ===\nIn 1985, the enterprise installed a computerized billing system.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Products ==\n\n=== Snacks and namkeen ===\nChitale Bandhu Mithaiwale has over 40 varieties of Namkeen sold at multiple outlets.
