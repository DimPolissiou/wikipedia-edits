The [[China\u2013Indonesia relations|trade between China and the Indonesian archipelago]] flourished from the era of [[Srivijaya]] around the 10th century and intensified in the [[Majapahit]] era around the 15th century. By that time Chinese immigrants had begun to settle in the archipelago, bringing along with them their culture and [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine|cuisine]]. Chinese people usually favour freshly cooked hot food, and in their culture it is taboo to throw away uneaten foodstuffs.<ref name=\"Historia-NG\"/> As a result, the previous day's leftover rice was often recooked in the morning. Previously, Indonesians probably simply sun-dried the leftover rice to make ''intip'' or ''[[rengginang]]'' (rice cracker), the dried rice also could be ground to make rice flour.\n\nThe Chinese influences upon Indonesian cuisine can be seen in ''[[mie goreng]]'' that appeared simultaneously with the introduction of the [[stir frying]] technique that required the use of a Chinese [[wok]].<ref>{{cite book | title = A New Approach to Indonesian Cooking | author = Heinz Von Holzen | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd | year = 2014 | isbn = 9789814634953 | page = 15 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pRuiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Kwetiau+Goreng+Chinese+Indonesian+noodle#v=onepage&q=Kwetiau%20Goreng&f=false }}</ref> In China, the stir frying technique became increasingly popular during [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644 CE).<ref>{{cite book | title = Stir-Frying to the Sky's Edge: The Ultimate Guide to Mastery, with Authentic Recipes and Stories | author = Grace Young | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781416580577| url = https://books.google.com/?id=buSaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=Stir+frying+Ming+dynasty#v=onepage&q=Stir%20frying%20Ming%20dynasty&f=false | page = 49}}</ref> The introduction of stir frying technique, Chinese wok, and also soy sauce probably took place around or after this period, circa 17th century.

It is in the menu, introduced, offered and served in Indonesian Theater Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. [[Howard P. Jones|Howard Palfrey Jones]], the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of [[Sukarno]]'s reign in mid 1960s, in his memoir \"Indonesia: The Possible Dream\", said that he like ''nasi goreng''. He described his fondness for ''nasi goreng'' cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno's wives, and praise it as the most delicious ''nasi goreng'' he ever tasted.<ref name=\"Historia-NG\"/>\n\n''Nasi goreng'' is ubiquitous in Indonesia, and also popular in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, as well as the Netherlands through its colonial ties with Indonesia.<ref name=\"Scheerstra\"/> Today microwave-heated [[frozen food|frozen]] ''nasi goreng'' is available in convenience stores, such as [[7-Eleven]] and [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] in Indonesia.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Pete Kambing.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi goreng'' with [[Parkia speciosa|green stinky beans]] and goat meat in Jakarta.]]\n''Nasi goreng'' is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.femina.in/life/travel/travel-with-food-nasi-goreng-83223.html|title=Travel with food: Indonesia with Nasi Goreng|work=femina.in|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> owed to generous amount of caramelised ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) and ground powdered ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), and the flavour is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice.<ref name=\"Patterned\"/> ''Nasi goreng'' often includes ''[[krupuk]]'' and ''bawang goreng'' (fried shallots) or (fried onions) to give a crispier texture.\n\nThe main ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' include pre-cooked rice, sweet [[soy sauce]], powdered ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), salt, garlic, [[shallot]], [[chilli pepper]], [[spring onion]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[turmeric]], [[vegetable oil]], [[onions]], [[palm sugar]], [[Bumbu (seasoning)#Basic bumbu|ginger garlic paste]], and slices of [[cucumber]] and tomato for garnishing. Some recipes may add [[black pepper]], [[fish sauce]], or powdered broth as a seasoning and taste enhancer. Eggs might be mixed into fried rice or fried separately, either as ''telur ceplok''/''telur mata sapi'' ([[Fried egg|sunny side up eggs]]), or ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]), and also ''telur rebus'' (boiled eggs). Originally optional, the addition of fried egg is often named as ''nasi goreng spesial (pakai telur)'' or special fried rice topped with fried egg.\n\n=== Condiments ===\n''Nasi goreng'' often add condiments as add-on upon the fried rice. Fried shallot and traditional crackers are often sprinkled upon to give crispy texture, pickles are added to give sour freshness in otherwise rather oily dish, a fried [[Egg as food|egg]] is often placed on top of the dish to add savouriness, while chili paste is to add the zesty spiciness according to one's preference. Some common condiments are:\n*''[[Bawang goreng]]'': fried [[shallot]], spinkled upon ''nasi goreng''\n*''[[Kerupuk]]'': various types of crackers, usually ''[[emping]]'' or [[prawn cracker]]s\n*''[[Acar]]'': [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] made from vinegar preserved cucumber, shallots, carrot, and small chilli pepper\n*''[[Fried egg|Telur]]'': egg; could be cooked in many ways and placed on the nasi goreng, usually fried or [[omelette]]\n*''[[Sambal]]'': chilli sauce\n\n== Variations ==\nThere is no single recipe of ''nasi goreng'', as every fried rice dish with certain mixtures, additions, ingredients, and toppings could lead to another recipe of ''nasi goreng''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jo|first1=Andru|title=The Indonesians' nasi goreng recipes|url=https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/stir-fried-nasi-goreng-noodle/|accessdate=17 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130125644/https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/stir-fried-nasi-goreng-noodle/|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Usually, in Indonesian households, the ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' prepared for daily breakfast are the leftovers of the previous day's meals preserved in the refrigerator, with fresh vegetables and eggs added. The basic ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' are rice and sliced or ground ''[[Bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' (spices) mixture of [[shallot]], garlic, pepper, salt, tomato ketchup, [[sambal]] or chili sauce, and usually sweet soy sauce. Some variants may add ''saus tiram'' ([[oyster sauce]]), ''ang-ciu'' (Chinese cooking red wine), ''kecap ikan'' ([[fish sauce]]), or ''kecap inggris'' (like [[Worcestershire sauce]]). The texture of leftover cooked rice is considered more suitable for ''nasi goreng'' than that of newly cooked rice, as freshly cooked rice is too moist and soft.\n\n''Nasi goreng'' is known as fried rice variants commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Despite myriad specific regional variants, it is notable that certain recipe appears in multiple countries, ''kampung'' (village), shrimp paste, ''sambal'', salted fish and egg-wrapped fried rices are appears in both Indonesia and Malaysia. There are similar fried rice dishes from neighbouring countries, such as ''[[Thai fried rice|khao phat]]'' from Thailand, and ''[[sinangag]]'' from the Philippines.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Kambing Kebon Sirih Jakarta 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cooking ''nasi goreng kambing'' (fried rice with goat meat) in bulk in Kebon Sirih area, [[Central Jakarta]].]]\nIn most parts of Indonesia, ''nasi goreng'' is cooked with ample amounts of ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) that creates a golden brownish colour, and the flavour is mildly sweet.<ref name=\"Chesman\"/> However, in other places such as Eastern Indonesia ([[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]), the sweet soy sauce is usually absent and is replaced by bottled tomato and chili sauce, creating reddish-coloured ''nasi goreng''.

Indonesian migrants (or their offspring) cater Indonesian food both in restaurants and as take-away. Also, take-away versions of ''nasi goreng'' are plentiful in ''[[Toko (shop)|toko]]'' Asian grocery shop and supermarkets.<ref name=\"Scheerstra\"/> Supermarkets also commonly carry several brands of spice mix for ''nasi goreng'', along with ''krupuk'' and other Indonesian cooking supplies. Chinese take-aways and restaurants have also adapted ''nasi goreng'', plus a selection of other Indonesian dishes, but spice them Cantonese style. In [[Flanders]], the name ''nasi goreng'' is often used for any Asian style of fried rice. Distinctive version of ''nasi goreng'' has been developed, such as Javanese-Suriname version of the dish.<ref name=\"Tropilab\"/> In the Netherlands, ''nasi goreng'' has been developed into snack called ''[[nasischijf]]'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"nasi disk\"), it is a Dutch deep-fried fast food, consisting of ''nasi goreng'' inside a crust of breadcrumbs.\n\n== Servings ==\n\n=== Homemade ===\n''Nasi goreng'' can be eaten at any time of day, and many Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans eat ''nasi goreng'' for breakfast.<ref name=\"Street Food Around the World\"/> In most of households, last night leftovers stored in refrigerator are often used to create ''nasi goreng'' for breakfast; such as chunks of chicken, shrimp, vegetables, fish, beef, ''bakso'' or sausages. The rice used to make ''nasi goreng'' is cooked ahead of time and left to cool down (so it is not soggy), which is one reason to use rice cooked from the day before.\n\n=== Street vendor ===\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Travelling Vendor in Jakarta.JPG|thumb|right|A [[street vendor]] cooking ''nasi goreng'' in his cart. The travelling night hawkers often frequenting [[Jakarta]] residential area.]]\nWhile most Indonesian households serve it for breakfast, ''nasi goreng'' is also a popular choice for late night supper served by [[street vendor]]s, in ''[[warung]]s'' and also by travelling night hawkers that frequent Indonesian residential neighbourhoods with their wheeled carts.<ref name=\"Street Food Around the World\"/> The ''nasi goreng'' is usually cooked on order for each serving, since the cook usually asks the client their preference on the degree of spiciness: mild, medium, hot or extra hot. The spiciness corresponds to the amount of ''[[sambal]]'' or chili pepper paste used. The cook might also ask how the client would like their egg done: mixed into nasi goreng or fried separately as ''telur mata sapi'' or ''ceplok'' (fried whole egg) or as ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]). The term ''spesial pakai telur'' means the ''nasi goreng'' has two eggs per serving, one mixed into the ''nasi goreng'' as scrambled egg, another fried separately. As well as offering ''nasi goreng'', the travelling ''nasi goreng'' cart vendors usually also serve ''[[mi goreng]], [[mi rebus]]'', and ''[[kwetiau goreng]]''. ''Nasi goreng'' usually made by order, nevertheless, some popular ''nasi goreng'' ''warung'' or food stall might cook them in bulk, due to large demand. The degree of spiciness is applied by customer through the addition of ''sambal'' hot sauces.\n\n=== Restaurant ===\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Breakfast Set in Solo.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi goreng'' breakfast in a hotel in [[Surakarta|Solo]], [[Central Java]], with papaya juice and Java black coffee.]]\n\n''Nasi goreng'' is a popular dish in Indonesian restaurants and Asian fusion restaurants.

The common [[soy sauce]] has its origin in 2nd century CE China, however, ''kecap manis'' ([[sweet soy sauce]]) was developed in Indonesia with a generous addition of local [[palm sugar]].<ref name=\"Soyinfo-Tempeh\">{{cite book | title = History of Tempeh and Tempeh Products (1815\u20132011): Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook | author1= William Shurtleff| author2= Akiko Aoyagi | publisher = Soyinfo Center | year = 2011 |isbn = 9781928914396 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qhsOY1z6-T8C&pg=PA618&dq=Kecap+manis+Indonesia#v=onepage&q=Kecap%20manis%20Indonesia&f=false | page = 618 }}</ref> Sweet soy sauce plus the addition of [[shrimp paste]] are the elements that distinguish Indonesian ''nasi goreng'' from [[Chinese fried rice]].\n\nOther than Chinese influence, there is another theory suggested that ''nasi goreng'' was actually inspired by a Middle Eastern dish called ''[[pilaf]]'', which is rice cooked in seasoned broth.<ref name=\"JP-Ulung\">{{cite news | title = Tracing history of Indonesian culinary fare | author = A.

It is in the menu, introduced, offered and served in Indonesian Theater Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. [[Howard P. Jones|Howard Palfrey Jones]], the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of [[Sukarno]]'s reign in mid 1960s, in his memoir \"Indonesia: The Possible Dream\", said that he like ''nasi goreng''. He described his fondness for ''nasi goreng'' cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno's wives, and praise it as the most delicious ''nasi goreng'' he ever tasted.<ref name=\"Historia-NG\"/>\n\n''Nasi goreng'' is ubiquitous in Indonesia, and also popular in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, as well as the Netherlands through its colonial ties with Indonesia.<ref name=\"Scheerstra\"/> Today microwave-heated [[frozen food|frozen]] ''nasi goreng'' is available in convenience stores, such as [[7-Eleven]] and [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] in Indonesia.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Pete Kambing.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi goreng'' with [[Parkia speciosa|green stinky beans]] and goat meat in Jakarta.]]\n''Nasi goreng'' is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.femina.in/life/travel/travel-with-food-nasi-goreng-83223.html|title=Travel with food: Indonesia with Nasi Goreng|work=femina.in|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> owed to generous amount of caramelised ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) and ground powdered ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), and the flavour is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice.<ref name=\"Patterned\"/> ''Nasi goreng'' often includes ''[[krupuk]]'' and ''bawang goreng'' (fried shallots) or (fried onions) to give a crispier texture.\n\nThe main ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' include pre-cooked rice, sweet [[soy sauce]], powdered ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), salt, garlic, [[shallot]], [[chilli pepper]], [[spring onion]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[turmeric]], [[vegetable oil]], [[onions]], [[palm sugar]], [[Bumbu (seasoning)#Basic bumbu|ginger garlic paste]], and slices of [[cucumber]] and tomato for garnishing. Some recipes may add [[black pepper]], [[fish sauce]], or powdered broth as a seasoning and taste enhancer. Eggs might be mixed into fried rice or fried separately, either as ''telur ceplok''/''telur mata sapi'' ([[Fried egg|sunny side up eggs]]), or ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]), and also ''telur rebus'' (boiled eggs). Originally optional, the addition of fried egg is often named as ''nasi goreng spesial (pakai telur)'' or special fried rice topped with fried egg.\n\n=== Condiments ===\n''Nasi goreng'' often add condiments as add-on upon the fried rice. Fried shallot and traditional crackers are often sprinkled upon to give crispy texture, pickles are added to give sour freshness in otherwise rather oily dish, a fried [[Egg as food|egg]] is often placed on top of the dish to add savouriness, while chili paste is to add the zesty spiciness according to one's preference. Some common condiments are:\n*''Bawang goreng'': fried [[shallot]], spinkled upon ''nasi goreng''\n*''[[Kerupuk]]'': various types of crackers, usually ''[[emping]]'' or [[prawn cracker]]s\n*''[[Acar]]'': [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] made from vinegar preserved cucumber, shallots, carrot, and small chilli pepper\n*''[[Fried egg|Telur]]'': egg; could be cooked in many ways and placed on the nasi goreng, usually fried or [[omelette]]\n*''[[Sambal]]'': chilli sauce\n\n== Variations ==\nThere is no single recipe of ''nasi goreng'', as every fried rice dish with certain mixtures, additions, ingredients, and toppings could lead to another recipe of ''nasi goreng''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jo|first1=Andru|title=The Indonesians' nasi goreng recipes|url=https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/stir-fried-nasi-goreng-noodle/|accessdate=17 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130125644/https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/stir-fried-nasi-goreng-noodle/|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Usually, in Indonesian households, the ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' prepared for daily breakfast are the leftovers of the previous day's meals preserved in the refrigerator, with fresh vegetables and eggs added. The basic ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' are rice and sliced or ground ''[[Bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' (spices) mixture of [[shallot]], garlic, pepper, salt, tomato ketchup, [[sambal]] or chili sauce, and usually sweet soy sauce. Some variants may add ''saus tiram'' ([[oyster sauce]]), ''ang-ciu'' (Chinese cooking red wine), ''kecap ikan'' ([[fish sauce]]), or ''kecap inggris'' (like [[Worcestershire sauce]]). The texture of leftover cooked rice is considered more suitable for ''nasi goreng'' than that of newly cooked rice, as freshly cooked rice is too moist and soft.\n\n''Nasi goreng'' is known as fried rice variants commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Despite myriad specific regional variants, it is notable that certain recipe appears in multiple countries, ''kampung'' (village), shrimp paste, ''sambal'', salted fish and egg-wrapped fried rices are appears in both Indonesia and Malaysia. There are similar fried rice dishes from neighbouring countries, such as ''[[Thai fried rice|khao phat]]'' from Thailand, and ''[[sinangag]]'' from the Philippines.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Kambing Kebon Sirih Jakarta 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cooking ''nasi goreng kambing'' (fried rice with goat meat) in bulk in Kebon Sirih area, [[Central Jakarta]].]]\nIn most parts of Indonesia, ''nasi goreng'' is cooked with ample amounts of ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) that creates a golden brownish colour, and the flavour is mildly sweet.<ref name=\"Chesman\"/> However, in other places such as Eastern Indonesia ([[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]), the sweet soy sauce is usually absent and is replaced by bottled tomato and chili sauce, creating reddish-coloured ''nasi goreng''. This variant is called ''nasi goreng merah'' (red fried rice) or ''nasi goreng Makassar'' after the [[Makassar|South Sulawesi capital]]. Some variants of ''nasi goreng'', such as salted fish or ''teri Medan'' ([[Medan]]'s [[anchovy]]) ''nasi goreng'', do not use ''kecap manis'' at all, creating a lighter colour similar to Chinese fried rice or Japanese ''[[Chahan (food)|chahan]]''.\n\n''Nasi goreng Kambing Kebon Sirih'' is a popular variant of goat meat fried rice sold in the Kebon Sirih area, Central Jakarta;<ref>{{cite news | title = Legendary 'nasi goreng' continues to draw crowds | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | location = Jakarta | date = 17 October 2015 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/10/17/legendary-nasi-goreng-continues-draw-crowds.html}}</ref> while ''[[nasi goreng amplop]]'' is fried rice \"enveloped\" inside thin [[omelette]] skin, almost identical to Malaysian ''[[nasi goreng pattaya]]''.\n\nThe most common ''nasi goreng'' variants usually use chicken and egg, however, some variants are named after their additional ingredients.

Indonesian migrants (or their offspring) cater Indonesian food both in restaurants and as take-away. Also, take-away versions of ''nasi goreng'' are plentiful in ''[[Toko (shop)|toko]]'' Asian grocery shop and supermarkets.<ref name=\"Scheerstra\"/> Supermarkets also commonly carry several brands of spice mix for ''nasi goreng'', along with ''krupuk'' and other Indonesian cooking supplies. Chinese take-aways and restaurants have also adapted ''nasi goreng'', plus a selection of other Indonesian dishes, but spice them Cantonese style. In [[Flanders]], the name ''nasi goreng'' is often used for any Asian style of fried rice. Distinctive version of ''nasi goreng'' has been developed, such as Javanese-Suriname version of the dish.<ref name=\"Tropilab\"/> In the Netherlands, ''nasi goreng'' has been developed into snack called ''[[nasischijf]]'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"nasi disk\"), it is a Dutch deep-fried fast food, consisting of ''nasi goreng'' inside a crust of breadcrumbs.\n\n== Servings ==\n\n=== Homemade ===\n''Nasi goreng'' can be eaten at any time of day, and many Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans eat ''nasi goreng'' for breakfast.<ref name=\"Street Food Around the World\"/> In most of households, last night leftovers stored in refrigerator are often used to create ''nasi goreng'' for breakfast; such as chunks of chicken, shrimp, vegetables, fish, beef, ''bakso'' or sausages. The rice used to make ''nasi goreng'' is cooked ahead of time and left to cool down (so it is not soggy), which is one reason to use rice cooked from the day before.\n\n=== Street vendor ===\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Travelling Vendor in Jakarta.JPG|thumb|right|A [[street vendor]] cooking ''nasi goreng'' in his cart. The travelling night hawkers often frequenting [[Jakarta]] residential area.]]\nWhile most Indonesian households serve it for breakfast, ''nasi goreng'' is also a popular choice for late night supper served by [[street vendor]]s, in ''[[warung]]s'' and also by travelling night hawkers that frequent Indonesian residential neighbourhoods with their wheeled carts.<ref name=\"Street Food Around the World\"/> The ''nasi goreng'' is usually cooked on order for each serving, since the cook usually asks the client their preference on the degree of spiciness: mild, medium, hot or extra hot. The spiciness corresponds to the amount of ''[[sambal]]'' or chili pepper paste used. The cook might also ask how the client would like their egg done: mixed into nasi goreng or fried separately as ''telur mata sapi'' or ''ceplok'' (fried whole egg) or as ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]). The term ''spesial pakai telur'' means the ''nasi goreng'' has two eggs per serving, one mixed into the ''nasi goreng'' as scrambled egg, another fried separately. As well as offering ''nasi goreng'', the travelling ''nasi goreng'' cart vendors usually also serve ''[[mi goreng]], [[mi rebus]]'', and ''[[kwetiau goreng]]''. ''Nasi goreng'' usually made by order, nevertheless, some popular ''nasi goreng'' ''warung'' or food stall might cook them in bulk, due to large demand. The degree of spiciness is applied by customer through the addition of ''sambal'' hot sauces.\n\n=== Restaurant ===\n[[File:Nasi Goreng Breakfast Set in Solo.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi goreng'' breakfast in a hotel in [[Surakarta|Solo]], [[Central Java]], with papaya juice and Java black coffee.]]\n\n''Nasi goreng'' is a popular dish in Indonesian restaurants and Asian fusion restaurants.
