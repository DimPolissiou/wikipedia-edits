Commonly used drying oils include [[linseed oil]], [[poppy seed oil]], [[walnut oil]], and [[safflower oil]]. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the [[oil paint]], such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a [[resin]], such as pine resin or [[frankincense]], to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\n\nAlthough oil paint was first used for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] paintings by painters in central and western [[Afghanistan]] sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Carolyn|title=Earliest Oil Paintings Found in Famed Afghan Caves|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080205-afghan-paintings_2.html|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>  it did not gain popularity until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in Northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\nIn recent years, [[water miscible oil paint]] has become available. Water-soluble paints are either engineered or an [[emulsifier]] has been added that allows them to be thinned with water rather than [[paint thinner]], and allows, when sufficiently diluted, very fast drying times (1\u20133 days) when compared with traditional oils (1\u20133 weeks).\n\n==Techniques==\n[[Image:Sj\u00e4lvportr\u00e4tt av Anders Zorn 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|''Self-portrait, at work'', [[Anders Zorn]], ''1897''|alt=Painting shows a man in the foreground with a loose-fitting white outfit and a mustache holding a wooden palette with his paints. A pair of feminine legs are visible upper right.]]\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. [[Oil paint]] is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade [[mineral spirits]], or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is '[[fat over lean]]', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. \n\nThere are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint. \n\nTraditionally, paint was transferred to the painting surface using [[paintbrush]]es, but there are other methods, including using [[palette knife|palette knives]] and rags. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some [[turpentine]] for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped. Oil paint dries by [[oxidation]], not [[evaporation]], and is usually dry to the touch within a span of two weeks (some colors dry within days). It is generally dry enough to be [[varnish]]ed in six months to a year. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Selfportrait (Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn) - Nationalmuseum - 22374.tif|thumb|upright|Self-portrait of [[Rembrandt]], 1630.

However, [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, ''On Various Arts'', written in 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. However, [[early Netherlandish painting]] with artists like Van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] in the 15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.\n\nEarly works were still [[panel painting]]s on wood, but around the end of the 15th century [[canvas]] became more popular as the support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of [[gesso]] (a fine type of plaster). [[Venice]], where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small [[cabinet painting]]s were also made on metal, especially copper plates.  These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from [[printmaking]] were reused for this purpose. The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based [[fresco]] for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.\n\n==Ingredients==\n[[File:Flax seeds.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flax#Flax seeds|Flax seed]] is the source of linseed oil.|alt=A close-up of glistening, golden flax seeds.]]\n\nThe linseed oil itself comes from the [[flax]] seed, a common fiber crop. [[Linen]], a \"support\" for oil painting (see relevant section), also comes from the flax plant. [[Safflower]] oil or the [[walnut]] or [[poppyseed oil]] are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they \"yellow\" less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film.  Linseed oil tends to dry yellow and can change the hue of the color.\n\nRecent advances in [[chemistry]] have produced modern [[water miscible oil paint]]s that can be used and cleaned up with water. Small alterations in the [[molecule|molecular]] structure of the oil creates this water [[miscible]] property.\n\n==Supports for oil painting==\n[[Image:Splined Canvas.jpg|thumb|[[Splined canvas]]|alt=A square canvas rests atop another with its back showing a thick frame of wood.]]\n\nTraditional artists' [[canvas]] is made from [[linen]], but less expensive [[cotton]] fabric has gained popularity. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a \"stretcher\" or \"strainer\". The difference between the two names is that ''stretchers'' are slightly adjustable, while ''strainers'' are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a \"[[sizing|size]]\" to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of [[animal glue]] (modern painters will use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a ''gesso'', a mixture of glue and chalk.\n\nModern acrylic \"[[gesso]]\" is made of [[titanium dioxide]] with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a \"sandable\" acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white.  The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible in the surface of finished paintings as a change that's not from the paint.\n\nStandard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century. The standards were used by most artists, not only the French, as it was\u2014and evidently still is\u2014supported by the main suppliers of artists' materials. Size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate \"runs\" for figures (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage'') and marines (''marine'') that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a ''0 figure'' corresponds in height with a ''paysage 1'' and a ''marine 2''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Haaf|first= Beatrix|title=Industriell vorgrundierte Malleinen.

Panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Oil painting palette.jpg|thumb|A traditional wood [[Palette (painting)|palette]] used to hold and mix small amounts of paint while working.|alt=A man's finger sticks through a hole in a large wooden palette. One of his hands is dipping a brush into the paint and the other holds numerous brushes in reserve.]]\nOil paint is made by mixing [[pigment]]s of colors with an oil medium.  Different colors are made, or purchased premixed, before painting begins, but further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities together as the painting process is underway. An [[artist's palette]], traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints of different colors. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as [[sulphide]]s for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods of time; the appearance of many old paintings today is very different from the original. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\n\nTraditionally, artists mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves and [[List of artistic media#Painting|medium]]. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the [[studio]]. This changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter [[John Goffe Rand]]'s invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841 (the year of [[Claude Monet]]'s birth). Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient [[plein air]] painting (a common approach in French [[Impressionism]]).\n\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and [[mongoose]] hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red [[sable]] brushes ([[weasel]] hair). The finest quality brushes are called \"[[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|kolinsky sable]]\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the [[Siberian weasel]]. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \"snap.\" Floppy fibers with no snap, such as [[squirrel]] hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\n\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as [[cost efficient]].\n \nBrushes come in many sizes and are used for different purposes. The ''type'' of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their [[Fingerpaint|fingers]].\n\n[[File:Tubes of paint, artist's paint PNG.png|thumb|left|Tubes of paint]]\nOil painters traditionally applied paint in layers known as \"glazes\", a method also simply called \"indirect painting\".  This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the [[egg tempera]] painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\". The first coat (the [[underpainting]]) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in [[fresco]] technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \"mosaic\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\n\nArtists in later periods, such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] era (late 19th century), often expanded on this [[wet-on-wet]] method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"[[alla prima]]\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\n\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from [[dammar gum]] crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and [[Art Conservation and Restoration|conservation]]. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.\n\n==Examples of famous works==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', [[Jan van Eyck]], ''1434'' (on panel)\nImage:La donna velata v2.jpg|''[[La velata|La donna velata]]'', [[Raphael]], ''1516''\nImage:Tizian_085.jpg|''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', [[Titian]], ''1562''\nImage:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''1610\u201311''\nImage:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg| ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', [[Rembrandt]], ''1632''\nImage:Innocent-x-velazquez.jpg| ''[[Portrait of Innocent X|Innocent X]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''c 1650''\nImage:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'', [[Johannes Vermeer]], ''1658\u20131660''\nImage:The_Toilet_of_Venus,_by_Fran\u00e7ois_Boucher.jpg| ''The Toilet of Venus'', [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''1751''\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg| ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', Thomas Gainsborough, ''1770''\nImage:Battle of Somosierra by Piotr Micha\u0142owski.PNG|''[[Battle of Somosierra]]'', [[Piotr Micha\u0142owski]], 1837\nImage:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', [[Claude Monet]], ''1875''\nImage:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg| ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] ''1876''\nImage:Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpg|''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''1890''\nImage:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1892-95, Les joueurs de carte (The Card Players), 60 x 73 cm, oil on canvas, Courtauld Institute of Art, London.jpg|''[[The Card Players]]'', [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''1892''\nImage:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1903\nImage:Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1907\nImage:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|''Composition VII'', [[Wassily Kandinsky]], ''1913''\nImage:Chagall Bella.jpg| ''[[Bella with White Collar]]'', [[Marc Chagall]], ''1917''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikibooks|Introduction to Art}}\n{{commons category|Oil paintings}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Britannica|426194|Oil painting}}\n* Chieffo, Clifford T.:Contemporary Oil Painter's Handbook, Prentice Hall, 1976\n* Borchert, Till-Holger.

Size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate \"runs\" for figures (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage'') and marines (''marine'') that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a ''0 figure'' corresponds in height with a ''paysage 1'' and a ''marine 2''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Haaf|first= Beatrix|title=Industriell vorgrundierte Malleinen.

Panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Oil painting palette.jpg|thumb|A traditional wood [[Palette (painting)|palette]] used to hold and mix small amounts of paint while working.|alt=A man's finger sticks through a hole in a large wooden palette. One of his hands is dipping a brush into the paint and the other holds numerous brushes in reserve.]]\nOil paint is made by mixing [[pigment]]s of colors with an oil medium.  Different colors are made, or purchased premixed, before painting begins, but further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities together as the painting process is underway. An [[artist's palette]], traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints of different colors. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as [[sulphide]]s for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods of time; the appearance of many old paintings today is very different from the original. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\n\nTraditionally, artists mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves and [[List of artistic media#Painting|medium]]. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the [[studio]]. This changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter [[John Goffe Rand]]'s invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841 (the year of [[Claude Monet]]'s birth). Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient [[plein air]] painting (a common approach in French [[Impressionism]]).\n\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and [[mongoose]] hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red [[sable]] brushes ([[weasel]] hair). The finest quality brushes are called \"[[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|kolinsky sable]]\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the [[Siberian weasel]]. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \"snap.\" Floppy fibers with no snap, such as [[squirrel]] hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\n\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as [[cost efficient]].\n \nBrushes come in many sizes and are used for different purposes. The ''type'' of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their [[Fingerpaint|fingers]].\n\n[[File:Tubes of paint, artist's paint PNG.png|thumb|left|Tubes of paint]]\nOil painters traditionally applied paint in layers known as \"glazes\", a method also simply called \"indirect painting\".  This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the [[egg tempera]] painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\". The first coat (the [[underpainting]]) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in [[fresco]] technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \"mosaic\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\n\nArtists in later periods, such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] era (late 19th century), often expanded on this [[wet-on-wet]] method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"[[alla prima]]\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\n\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from [[dammar gum]] crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and [[Art Conservation and Restoration|conservation]]. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.\n\n==Examples of famous works==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', [[Jan van Eyck]], ''1434'' (on panel)\nImage:La donna velata v2.jpg|''[[La velata|La donna velata]]'', [[Raphael]], ''1516''\nImage:Tizian_085.jpg|''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', [[Titian]], ''1562''\nImage:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''1610\u201311''\nImage:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg| ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', [[Rembrandt]], ''1632''\nImage:Innocent-x-velazquez.jpg| ''[[Portrait of Innocent X|Innocent X]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''c 1650''\nImage:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'', [[Johannes Vermeer]], ''1658\u20131660''\nImage:The_Toilet_of_Venus,_by_Fran\u00e7ois_Boucher.jpg| ''The Toilet of Venus'', [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''1751''\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg| ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', Thomas Gainsborough, ''1770''\nImage:Battle of Somosierra by Piotr Micha\u0142owski.PNG|''[[Battle of Somosierra]]'', [[Piotr Micha\u0142owski]], 1837\nImage:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', [[Claude Monet]], ''1875''\nImage:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg| ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] ''1876''\nImage:Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpg|''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''1890''\nImage:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1892-95, Les joueurs de carte (The Card Players), 60 x 73 cm, oil on canvas, Courtauld Institute of Art, London.jpg|''[[The Card Players]]'', [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''1892''\nImage:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1903\nImage:Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1907\nImage:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|''Composition VII'', [[Wassily Kandinsky]], ''1913''\nImage:Chagall Bella.jpg| ''[[Bella with White Collar]]'', [[Marc Chagall]], ''1917''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikibooks|Introduction to Art}}\n{{commons category|Oil paintings}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Britannica|426194|Oil painting}}\n* Chieffo, Clifford T.:Contemporary Oil Painter's Handbook, Prentice Hall, 1976\n* Borchert, Till-Holger.

His mother was Pilar Terreros Segade, an [[illustrator]] and [[comedy|comedic]] author and his sister, [[Pilar Mill\u00e1n Astray]] was to be a noted writer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/12790/pilar-millan-astray-y-terreros|title=Pilar Mill\u00e1n Astray y Terreros {{!}} Real Academia de la Historia|website=dbe.rah.es|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> Though pressed to study law, Mill\u00e1n-Astray aspired to a military career.\n\nOn August 30, 1894, he entered the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de Toledo|Academia de Infanter\u00eda de Toledo]]'' (\"Infantry Academy of Toledo\"). He graduated as a [[second lieutenant]] at the age of sixteen, and later served in the army in Madrid. On September 1, 1896, he enrolled in the ''Escuela Superior de Guerra'' (\"Superior Military School\").\n\nOn March 2, 1906, he married Elvira Guti\u00e9rrez de la Torre, daughter of General [[Guti\u00e9rrez C\u00e1mara]]. Only after the wedding did she reveal her intention to remain [[chastity|chaste]]. From this point on, the couple would maintain (in Mill\u00e1n-Astray's own words) a \"fraternal relationship\". It appears, nevertheless, that Elvira was a very devoted, if not subservient, wife.\n\n== Career ==\nUpon graduation, he joined the [[General staff]] of the [[Army of Spain|Spanish army]]. Soon after, rebellion broke out in the [[Philippines]], and he left his position to serve there as a volunteer second lieutenant. He would earn numerous decorations for his valor (''Cruz de [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Mar\u00eda Cristina]]'', ''Cruz Roja al M\u00e9rito Militar'', and ''Cruz Primera Clase al M\u00e9rito Militar'') and became something of a [[war hero]] for his defence at the age of 18 of the city of [[San Rafael, Bulacan|San Rafael]], in which he fought off a rebel force of two thousand with only thirty men. He subsequently served in the [[Rif War]].\n\nOn October 26, 1924, while stationed in [[Morocco]], he was wounded in the left arm during an ambush resulting in it needing to be amputated. \n\nHe continued leading his men and a month later, he lost his right eye when it was hit by a bullet. <ref>http://spartacus-educational.com/SPastray.htm</ref>\n\nThis earned him the sobriquet ''Glorioso mutilado'' (\"Glorious amputee\"). He habitually wore an eyepatch and a white glove on his right hand when appearing in public.\n\nInterested in forming a corps of foreign volunteers after the fashion of the [[French Foreign Legion]], he traveled to [[Algeria]] to study its workings. With the support of then Major [[Francisco Franco]], he created the [[Spanish Legion]], and, with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]], served as its first commander. He would popularize the [[motto]]s ''\u00a1Viva la Muerte!'' (\"Long live death!\") and ''\u00a1A m\u00ed la Legi\u00f3n!'' (\"To me the legion!\"). \n\nMill\u00e1n-Astray gave the legion a powerful ideology intended to evoke Spain's [[Spanish Empire|Imperial]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Christian]] traditions. For instance, the legion adopted a regimental unit called the ''[[tercio]]'' in memory of the famed Spanish infantry formations that had terrorized their opponents on the battlefields of [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Mill\u00e1n-Astray also revived the [[Spaniard]]'s ancient feud with the [[Moors]] and portrayed his men first as [[crusade]]rs on an extended ''[[Reconquista]]'' against the [[Islam]]ic civilization; and later as the [[salvation|saviour]]s of Spain warding off the twin evils of [[Communism]] and [[liberal democracy|democratic liberalism]].  Favored by King Alfonso XIII and rewarded for his heroic leadership of the Legion in the aftermath of the Spanish military defeat at Annual, in 1924, he was promoted to full colonel. In 1927, he was promoted to brigadier general.  In 1932, the Republican government of Aza\u00f1a placed him on the retirement list along with other generals regarded as hostile to the Republic. \n\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]] he sided with the [[Nationalist Spain|Nationalists]]. He served as director of the Office of Radio, Press, and Propaganda (1936-1937) on the Nationalist side and later (1937) was named head of the Corps of Wounded Veterans. It is said that he administered the press office like a military barracks, forcing journalists to fall in line in response to his whistle, and subjecting them to the same brutal harangues he had given as commander of the Legion.\n\n== Confrontation with Unamuno ==\nMill\u00e1n-Astray is perhaps best remembered for a heated response to [[Miguel de Unamuno]], the writer and philosopher, on October 12, 1936. The celebration of the 12th of October had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the [[University of Salamanca]], including [[Enrique Pla y Deniel]], the Archbishop of Salamanca, and [[Carmen Polo|Carmen Polo Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e9s]], the wife of Franco, and Mill\u00e1n-Astray himself. According to the [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] in his magnum opus ''The Spanish Civil War'' (1961), the affair began with an impassioned speech by the [[Falangism|Falangist]] writer [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pem\u00e1n]]. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as \"cancers on the body of the nation,\" adding that \"Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism.\" \n\nFrom somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto ''\"\u00a1Viva la Muerte!\"''. As was his habit, Mill\u00e1n-Astray responded with ''\"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"''; the crowd replied with ''\"\u00a1Una!\"''. He repeated ''\"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"''; the crowd then replied ''\"\u00a1Grande!\"''. A third time, Mill\u00e1n-Astray shouted ''\"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"''; the crowd responded ''\"\u00a1Libre!\"''. This was a common Falangist cheer. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, [[Roman salute|saluting]] the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. \n\nUnamuno, who was presiding over the meeting, rose up slowly and addressed the crowd: \"''You are waiting for my words. You know me well, and know I cannot remain silent for long. Sometimes, to remain silent is to lie, since silence can be interpreted as assent. I want to comment on the so-called speech of Professor Maldonado, who is with us here. I will ignore the personal offence to the Basques and Catalans. I myself, as you know, was born in Bilbao. The Bishop,''\" Unamuno gestured to the Archbishop of Salamanca, \"''Whether you like it or not, is Catalan, born in Barcelona. But now I have heard this insensible and necrophilous oath, ''\"\u00a1Viva la Muerte!\"'', and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Mill\u00e1n-Astray is an invalid. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is an invalid of war. So was [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many invalids. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Mill\u00e1n-Astray might dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. It should be expected from a mutilated who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes to find horrible solace in seeing how the number of mutilated ones multiplies around him.''\" Unamuno went on to praise the executed Filipino rebel [[Jose Rizal]], infuriating Millan-Astray who had actually fought against the rebels in the Spanish-ruled Philippines.\n\nMill\u00e1n-Astray reportedly responded: ''\"\u00a1Muera la inteligencia! \u00a1Viva la Muerte!\"'' (\"Death to intelligence! Long live death!\"), provoking applause from the Falangists (although some versions suggest he actually said: \"Death to traitor intellectuality\" but in the commotion in the auditorium this was not perceived). Pem\u00e1n, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed: ''\"\u00a1No! \u00a1Viva la inteligencia! \u00a1Mueran los malos intelectuales!\"'' (\"No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!\").\n\nUnamuno continued: \"This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win, because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken.\" Mill\u00e1n-Astray, controlling himself, shouted \"Take the lady's arm!\" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left in her protection.\n\nUnamuno's quote ''\"Vencer\u00e9is, pero no convencer\u00e9is\"'' (\"You will win, but you will not convince\") was, paradoxically, the slogan of the Salamanca municipality protesting the devolution from the [[General Archive of the Spanish Civil War]] to the [[Catalan Government]] of Catalan documentation seized during the war by the nationalist forces. Unamuno's heirs publicly decried this use. Unamuno left the hall escorting the wife of Franco, Carmen Polo de Franco, who had been present.\n\nIn 2018, the details of Unamuno's speech were disputed by the historian Severiano Delgado, who suggested that the account in a 1941 article by [[Luis Gabriel Portillo]] (who was not present at Salamanca) in the British magazine [[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]] may not have been an accurate representation of events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/famous-spanish-civil-war-speech-may-be-invented-says-historian | work=The Guardian | title=Spanish civil war speech invented by father of Michael Portillo, says historian | date=11 May 2018 | first=Sam | last=Jones}}</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\n \nIn 1941, during a game of [[bridge (card game)|bridge]], he fell in love with Rita Gasset, daughter of former public works minister [[Rafael Gasset]], and cousin of philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]. As a result, Mill\u00e1n-Astray separated from his wife Elvira. Franco, seeking to avoid a scandal, relocated Mill\u00e1n-Astray to [[Lisbon]]. Here, Rita gave birth to Mill\u00e1n-Astray's only child, a daughter named Peregrina, on January 23, 1942.\n\nAfter the affair, Mill\u00e1n-Astray was largely forgotten by the Spanish public. He eventually returned to Madrid, where he died of [[heart failure]] on January 1, 1954.\n\n== Reputation ==\nKnown for his flamboyant personality and his penchant for bold, chauvinist and self-aggrandizing antics, Mill\u00e1n-Astray was by all accounts prone to actions and general demeanor, both in and out of the battlefield, frequently described as reckless, impulsive and disturbingly ruthless, even by the hardened standards of most [[Spanish Empire#Territories in Africa (1898\u20131975)|Africanist]] officials;<ref>[http://rromerol.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!CAA802B80A85420E!126.entry The \"happy\" twenties]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caum.es/CARPETAS/cuadernos/cuadernospdf/libro1/marruecos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213201451/http://www.caum.es/CARPETAS/cuadernos/cuadernospdf/libro1/marruecos.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-13 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/astray.htm Analysis of Mill\u00e1n Astray's personality]</ref> there is no conclusive analysis concerning the causes of these actions, which could be prompted by environmental conditioning, [[antisocial personality disorder]], his alleged drug (mainly [[cocaine]]<ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/astray.htm] see the description by [[Domingo Batet]]</ref>) abuse or undiagnosed and untreated medical conditions, or perhaps by a combination thereof.

His mother was Pilar Terreros Segade, an [[illustrator]] and [[comedy|comedic]] author and his sister, [[Pilar Mill\u00e1n Astray]] was to be a noted writer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/12790/pilar-millan-astray-y-terreros|title=Pilar Mill\u00e1n Astray y Terreros {{!}} Real Academia de la Historia|website=dbe.rah.es|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> Though pressed to study law, Mill\u00e1n-Astray aspired to a military career.\n\nOn August 30, 1894, he entered the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de Toledo|Academia de Infanter\u00eda de Toledo]]'' (\"Infantry Academy of Toledo\"). He graduated as a [[second lieutenant]] at the age of sixteen, and later served in the army in Madrid. On September 1, 1896, he enrolled in the ''Escuela Superior de Guerra'' (\"Superior Military School\").\n\nOn March 2, 1906, he married Elvira Guti\u00e9rrez de la Torre, daughter of General [[Guti\u00e9rrez C\u00e1mara]]. Only after the wedding did she reveal her intention to remain [[chastity|chaste]]. From this point on, the couple would maintain (in Mill\u00e1n-Astray's own words) a \"fraternal relationship\". It appears, nevertheless, that Elvira was a very devoted, if not subservient, wife.\n\n== Career ==\nUpon graduation, he joined the [[General staff]] of the [[Army of Spain|Spanish army]]. Soon after, rebellion broke out in the [[Philippines]], and he left his position to serve there as a volunteer second lieutenant. He would earn numerous decorations for his valor (''Cruz de [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Mar\u00eda Cristina]]'', ''Cruz Roja al M\u00e9rito Militar'', and ''Cruz Primera Clase al M\u00e9rito Militar'') and became something of a [[war hero]] for his defence at the age of 18 of the city of [[San Rafael, Bulacan|San Rafael]], in which he fought off a rebel force of two thousand with only thirty men. He subsequently served in the [[Rif War]].\n\nOn October 26, 1924, while stationed in [[Morocco]], he was wounded in the left arm during an ambush resulting in it needing to be amputated. \n\nHe continued leading his men and a month later, he lost his right eye when it was hit by a bullet. <ref>http://spartacus-educational.com/SPastray.htm</ref>\n\nThis earned him the sobriquet ''Glorioso mutilado'' (\"Glorious amputee\"). He habitually wore an eyepatch and a white glove on his right hand when appearing in public.\n\nInterested in forming a corps of foreign volunteers after the fashion of the [[French Foreign Legion]], he traveled to [[Algeria]] to study its workings. With the support of then Major [[Francisco Franco]], he created the [[Spanish Legion]], and, with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]], served as its first commander. He would popularize the [[motto]]s ''\u00a1Viva la Muerte!'' (\"Long live death!\") and ''\u00a1A m\u00ed la Legi\u00f3n!'' (\"To me the legion!\"). \n\nMill\u00e1n-Astray gave the legion a powerful ideology intended to evoke Spain's [[Spanish Empire|Imperial]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Christian]] traditions. For instance, the legion adopted a regimental unit called the ''[[tercio]]'' in memory of the famed Spanish infantry formations that had terrorized their opponents on the battlefields of [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Mill\u00e1n-Astray also revived the [[Spaniard]]'s ancient feud with the [[Moors]] and portrayed his men first as [[crusade]]rs on an extended ''[[Reconquista]]'' against the [[Islam]]ic civilization; and later as the [[salvation|saviour]]s of Spain warding off the twin evils of [[Communism]] and [[liberal democracy|democratic liberalism]].  Favored by King Alfonso XIII and rewarded for his heroic leadership of the Legion in the aftermath of the Spanish military defeat at Annual, in 1924, he was promoted to full colonel. In 1927, he was promoted to brigadier general.  In 1932, the Republican government of Aza\u00f1a placed him on the retirement list along with other generals regarded as hostile to the Republic. \n\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]] he sided with the [[Nationalist Spain|Nationalists]]. He served as director of the Office of Radio, Press, and Propaganda (1936-1937) on the Nationalist side and later (1937) was named head of the Corps of Wounded Veterans. It is said that he administered the press office like a military barracks, forcing journalists to fall in line in response to his whistle, and subjecting them to the same brutal harangues he had given as commander of the Legion.\n\n== Confrontation with Unamuno ==\nMill\u00e1n-Astray is perhaps best remembered for a heated response to [[Miguel de Unamuno]], the writer and philosopher, on October 12, 1936. The celebration of the 12th of October had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the [[University of Salamanca]], including [[Enrique Pla y Deniel]], the Archbishop of Salamanca, and [[Carmen Polo|Carmen Polo Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e9s]], the wife of Franco, and Mill\u00e1n-Astray himself. According to the [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] in his magnum opus ''The Spanish Civil War'' (1961), the affair began with an impassioned speech by the [[Falangism|Falangist]] writer [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pem\u00e1n]]. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as \"cancers on the body of the nation,\" adding that \"Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism.\" \n\nFrom somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto ''\"\u00a1Viva la Muerte!\"''. As was his habit, Mill\u00e1n-Astray responded with ''\"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"''; the crowd replied with ''\"\u00a1Una!\"''. He repeated ''\"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"''; the crowd then replied ''\"\u00a1Grande!\"''. A third time, Mill\u00e1n-Astray shouted ''\"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"''; the crowd responded ''\"\u00a1Libre!\"''. This was a common Falangist cheer. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, [[Roman salute|saluting]] the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. \n\nUnamuno, who was presiding over the meeting, rose up slowly and addressed the crowd: \"''You are waiting for my words. You know me well, and know I cannot remain silent for long. Sometimes, to remain silent is to lie, since silence can be interpreted as assent. I want to comment on the so-called speech of Professor Maldonado, who is with us here. I will ignore the personal offence to the Basques and Catalans. I myself, as you know, was born in Bilbao. The Bishop,''\" Unamuno gestured to the Archbishop of Salamanca, \"''Whether you like it or not, is Catalan, born in Barcelona. But now I have heard this insensible and necrophilous oath, ''\"\u00a1Viva la Muerte!\"'', and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Mill\u00e1n-Astray is an invalid. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is an invalid of war. So was [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many invalids. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Mill\u00e1n-Astray might dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. It should be expected from a mutilated who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes to find horrible solace in seeing how the number of mutilated ones multiplies around him.''\" Unamuno went on to praise the executed Filipino rebel [[Jose Rizal]], infuriating Millan-Astray who had actually fought against the rebels in the Spanish-ruled Philippines.\n\nMill\u00e1n-Astray reportedly responded: ''\"\u00a1Muera la inteligencia! \u00a1Viva la Muerte!\"'' (\"Death to intelligence! Long live death!\"), provoking applause from the Falangists (although some versions suggest he actually said: \"Death to traitor intellectuality\" but in the commotion in the auditorium this was not perceived). Pem\u00e1n, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed: ''\"\u00a1No! \u00a1Viva la inteligencia! \u00a1Mueran los malos intelectuales!\"'' (\"No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!\").\n\nUnamuno continued: \"This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win, because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken.\" Mill\u00e1n-Astray, controlling himself, shouted \"Take the lady's arm!\" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left in her protection.\n\nUnamuno's quote ''\"Vencer\u00e9is, pero no convencer\u00e9is\"'' (\"You will win, but you will not convince\") was, paradoxically, the slogan of the Salamanca municipality protesting the devolution from the [[General Archive of the Spanish Civil War]] to the [[Catalan Government]] of Catalan documentation seized during the war by the nationalist forces. Unamuno's heirs publicly decried this use. Unamuno left the hall escorting the wife of Franco, Carmen Polo de Franco, who had been present.\n\nIn 2018, the details of Unamuno's speech were disputed by the historian Severiano Delgado, who suggested that the account in a 1941 article by [[Luis Gabriel Portillo]] (who was not present at Salamanca) in the British magazine [[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]] may not have been an accurate representation of events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/famous-spanish-civil-war-speech-may-be-invented-says-historian | work=The Guardian | title=Spanish civil war speech invented by father of Michael Portillo, says historian | date=11 May 2018 | first=Sam | last=Jones}}</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\n \nIn 1941, during a game of [[bridge (card game)|bridge]], he fell in love with Rita Gasset, daughter of former public works minister [[Rafael Gasset]], and cousin of philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]. As a result, Mill\u00e1n-Astray separated from his wife Elvira. Franco, seeking to avoid a scandal, relocated Mill\u00e1n-Astray to [[Lisbon]]. Here, Rita gave birth to Mill\u00e1n-Astray's only child, a daughter named Peregrina, on January 23, 1942.\n\nAfter the affair, Mill\u00e1n-Astray was largely forgotten by the Spanish public.

The most controversial issue was nationalisation of steel, which was profitable unlike the others. Economic recovery was slow, housing was in short supply, bread was rationed along with many necessities in short supply. It was an \"age of austerity\". American loans and Marshall Plan grants kept the economy afloat. India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon gained independence.

Tauris: London & New York, 2002), pp. 91-92.</ref> The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] returned to power in 1951, accepting most of Labour's postwar reforms, but introduced prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalized steel in 1953. They presided over 13 years of economic recovery and stability. However the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 demonstrated Britain was no longer a [[superpower]]. [[Ghana]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Kenya]] were granted independence during this period. Labour returned to power under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964 and oversaw a series of social reforms including the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the relaxing of divorce laws and the end of capital punishment. [[Edward Heath]] returned the Conservatives to power from 1970 to 1974, and oversaw the decimalisation of British currency, the accession of Britain to the [[European Economic Community]], and the height of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. In the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]] and a miner's strike, Heath introduced the three-day working week to conserve power.\n\nLabour made a return to power in 1974 but a series of strikes carried out by trade unions over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]) paralysed the country and as Labour lost its majority in parliament, a general election was called in 1979 which took [[Margaret Thatcher]] to power and began 18 years of Conservative government. Victory in the [[Falklands War]] (1982) and the government's strong opposition to trade unions helped lead the Conservative Party to another three terms in government. Thatcher initially pursued [[monetarism|monetarist]] policies and went on to privatise many of Britain's nationalised companies such as [[British Telecom]], [[British Gas Corporation]], [[British Airways]] and [[British Steel Corporation]]. She kept the National Health Service.  The controversial [[Community Charge]] (commonly called the \"Poll Tax\"), used to fund local government was unpopular and the Conservatives removed Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990.\n\nThatcher's successor [[John Major]] replaced the Poll Tax with the [[Council Tax]] and oversaw successful British involvement in the [[Gulf War]]. Despite a recession, Major led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in 1992. The events of [[Black Wednesday]] in 1992, party disunity over the [[European Union]] and several scandals involving Conservative politicians led to Labour under [[Tony Blair]] winning a landslide election victory in 1997. Labour had shifted its policies closer to the political centre, under the new slogan 'New Labour'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were given a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] respectively. A devolved power sharing [[Northern Ireland Executive]] was established in 1998, believed by many to be the end of The Troubles.\n\nBlair led Britain into the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] before leaving office in 2007, when he was succeeded by his Chancellor, [[Gordon Brown]]. A [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global recession in 2008\u201310]] led to Labour's defeat in the 2010 election. It was replaced by a Conservative-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] coalition, headed by [[David Cameron]], that pursued a series of public spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit. In June 2016, the UK [[Brexit|voted to leave the European Union]], which led to Cameron's resignation. Cameron was succeeded by his Home Secretary, [[Theresa May]].\n\nMay engaged in a policy to take the country out of the European Union with her flagship [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. With this deal having failed in the House of Commons three times, May resigned. A [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative leadership election]] ensued, which former [[Foreign Secretary]] and [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]] won. On the 24th July 2019, Johnson was appointed Prime Minister.\n\n==Labour Government, 1945\u201351==\n{{Further|Attlee ministry}}\n[[File:Attlee BW cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Clement Attlee]]]]\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the landslide [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] returned the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to power and [[Clement Attlee]] became Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Butler|1989|p=5}} The party quickly nationalised critical sectors of the economy, especially declining industries.

In fact labour ''shortages'' proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\nDespite the heavy American grants of [[Lend Lease]] food oil and munitions (which did not have to be repaid) plus American loans, and a grant of money and loans from Canada at the end of the war Britain was on the verge of bankruptcy.

Independence strengthened the Commonwealth, and had a valuable impact on the British economy, with large sums transferring back and forth, as well as fresh migrants arriving from India.

The U.S. provided  [[Anglo-American loan|a loan of $3.75 billion (US$57 billion in 2017) at a low 2% interest rate]]; Canada loaned an additional US$1.19 billion (US$16 billion in 2017).<ref>Philip A.

These funds came through the [[Marshall Plan]] and did not have to be repaid, however they carried the proviso that Britain modernize the management of its major corporations. The aid permitted Britain to provide consumption at tolerable levels despite the austerity.  About 40 per cent of the dollars went for food, drink and tobacco from the U.S. and 40 per cent on raw materials. The remainder went mostly for machinery and oil.<ref>Jim Tomlinson,  \"Marshall Aid and the \u2018Shortage Economy\u2019 in Britain in the 1940s.\" ''Contemporary European History'' 9#1 (2000): 137-155.

His third government \u2014 after the wartime national government and the short caretaker government of 1945 \u2014 would last until his resignation in 1955. During this period he renewed what he called the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States, and engaged himself in the formation of the post-war order.\n\nHis domestic priorities were, however, overshadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power.  Being a strong proponent of Britain as an international power, Churchill would often meet such moments with direct action.\n\nIn February 1952, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] died and was succeeded by his eldest daughter [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]].

When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the Mau Mau rebellion in 1952. On 17 August 1952, a state of emergency was declared, and British troops were flown to [[Kenya]] to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the ferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil war.\n\n====Malayan Emergency====\n{{main|Malayan Emergency}}\nIn [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948, led by Communists based in the local Chinese community.  Once again, Churchill's government inherited a crisis, and once again Churchill chose to use direct military action against those in rebellion while attempting to build an alliance with those who were not. He stepped up the implementation of a \"hearts and minds\" campaign and approved the creation of fortified villages, a tactic that would become a recurring part of Western military strategy in South-East Asia, especially in the American role in the  [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Richard Stubbs, ''Hearts and Minds in Guerrilla Warfare: The Malayan Emergency 1948-1960'' (1989).</ref><ref>Karl Hack, (1999) \"'Iron claws on Malaya': the historiography of the Malayan Emergency.\" ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'' 30#1 (1999): 99-125.</ref>\n\n===Anthony Eden (1955\u201357)===\n{{Further|Eden ministry}}\n[[File:Anthony Eden (retouched).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Eden]]]]\n\n====Suez crisis====\n{{main|Suez crisis}}\nIn April 1955, Churchill finally retired, and [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]] succeeded him as Prime Minister. Eden was a very popular figure, as a result of his long wartime service and also his famous good looks and charm. On taking office he immediately called a [[1955 United Kingdom general election|general election]], at which the Conservatives were returned with an increased majority. He left domestic issues to his lieutenants such as [[Rab Butler]], and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close alliance with US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]].<ref>Kevin Ruane, \"Anglo-American relations, the cold war and Middle East defence, 1953\u20131955.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 4#1 (2006): 1-25.</ref>\n\nOn 26 July 1956 [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], President of Egypt, nationalised the [[Suez Canal]] company, in violation of the international agreement he had signed with the UK in 1954. It had been owned and controlled by Britain since 1875 and was seen as essential to national defence and access to the Far East. Eden drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] who had to be stopped. In November 1956, after months of negotiation and attempts at mediation had failed to dissuade Nasser, Britain and France, in conjunction with Israel, invaded Egypt and occupied the Suez Canal Zone.\n\nEisenhower had warned Eden not to do it, saying the American people would never approve of a military solution to the crisis.<ref>Jonathan Pearson, ''Sir Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis: Reluctant Gamble'' (Springer, 2002).

Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US in the wake of World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.<ref>G.C.

He brought the economic concerns of the exchequer into the premiership, but his approach to the economy was to seek high employment; whereas his treasury ministers argued that to support the Bretton-Wood's requirement on the pound sterling would require strict control of the money base, and hence a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958, all the Treasury ministers resigned. Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bogdanor|first=Vernon|title=Harold Macmillan {{!}} Obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1986/dec/30/obituaries|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 May 2013|location=London|date=1 July 2005}}</ref>\n\nMacmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as part of his growth without inflation policy; it failed when the unions boycotted it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black|title=The Tory World: Deep History and the Tory Theme in British Foreign Policy, 1679-2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9mqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA343|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=343|isbn=9781317013785}}</ref>\n\nOne of Macmillan's more noteworthy actions was the [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|end of conscription]].

In terms of the Empire, Macmillan continued [[Decolonization#Decolonization after 1945|decolonisation]], his [[Wind of Change speech]] in February 1960 indicating his policy. [[Ghana]] and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] were granted independence in 1957, [[Nigeria]] in 1960 and [[Kenya]] in 1963.

Previously he had agreed to base sixty [[Thor missile]]s in Britain under joint control, and since late 1957 the American [[McMahon Act]] had been eased to allow Britain more access to nuclear technology. Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union signed the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] in autumn 1963. Britain's application to join the Common Market was vetoed by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 29 January 1963, in due to his fear that 'the end would be a colossal Atlantic Community dependent on America', and personal anger at the Anglo-American nuclear deal.<ref>Peter Mangold, ''Almost Impossible Ally: Harold Macmillan & Charles de Gaulle'' (2006).</ref>\n\nBritain's [[balance of payments]] problems led to the imposition of a seven-month [[wage freeze]] in 1961.<ref name=\"papers\">http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/strained-consensus-labour.htm Cabinet Papers - Strained consensus and Labour]</ref>   This caused the government to lose popularity and led to a series of [[by-election]] defeats.

However, as no prime minister had led from the House of Lords since the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] in 1902, Home chose to become a member of parliament so he could enter the House of Commons. He disclaimed his earldom and, as \"Sir Alec Douglas-Home\", contested a [[by-election]] in the safe seat of [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross & West Perthshire]]. He won and is the only prime minister to resign the Lords to enter the Commons.  His demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned, however. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor [[Reginald Maudling]] [[Rein|free rein]] to handle financial affairs. Home's few domestic policies were not well received, but he did abolish retail price maintenance, which allowed consumers to find more bargains on sale.  He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister [[Rab Butler]] was not especially energetic.  Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by de Gaulle, the Cuban missile crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again on the back burner. Decolonization issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.<ref>Andrew Holt, ''The Foreign Policy of the Douglas-Home Government: Britain, the United States and the End of Empire'' (Springer, 2014).</ref>\n\nIn the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], the Labour Party was returned to power under [[Harold Wilson]]. Douglas-Home became Leader of the Opposition. In July 1965, [[Edward Heath]] defeated Reginald Maudling and [[Enoch Powell]] to succeed him as Conservative Party leader. Enoch Powell was given the post of Shadow Defence Secretary and became a figure of national prominence when he made the controversial [[Rivers of Blood speech]] in 1968, warning on the dangers of mass [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|immigration from Commonwealth nations]]. It is possible that the Conservatives' success in the 1970 general election was a result of the large public following Powell attained, even as he was sacked from the shadow cabinet.\n\n===Thirteen Wasted Years?===\n\"Thirteen Wasted Years!\" was a popular slogan attacking the Conservative record 1951-1964. Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative Party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education. It is unrealistic to expect that Britain could have continued as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.<ref>Graham Goodlad,  \"Thirteen Wasted Years: \"Do the Conservative governments of  1951-64 deserve this label\" ''Modern History Review''  (2001) 13#2 pp 2-5.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Clements|title=My Revision Notes: AQA AS/A-level History: The Making of Modern Britain, 1951-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDMaDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT13|year=2017|publisher=Hodder Education|page=13|isbn=9781471876295}}</ref>\n\n==Labour Government, 1964\u201370==\n{{Further|First Wilson ministry}}\n[[File:Harold Wilson (1967).jpg|thumb|[[Harold Wilson]]]]\n\n===Harold Wilson===\nIn 1964, Labour regained the premiership, as [[Harold Wilson]] narrowly won the general election with a majority of five. This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after a short period of competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As Prime Minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast had seemed to present it as a triumph.\n\n====Open University====\nWilson regarded with special pride setting up  the [[Open University]] as a model for Europe. Plans were  drafted by Jennie Lee, the Minister for the Arts; she had Wilson's full support.  He saw the Open University as a major marker of the Labour Party's commitment to modernisation. He emphasized that it would strengthen a more competitive economy while also fostering greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. He especially favoured heavy use of technology, such as television and radio broadcast of its courses.  There were strong doubters and opponents in the  government and in commercial broadcasting; Wilson outmaneuvered them to get the budget approved, even though its sums proved far too small.<ref>Pete Dorey,  \"\u2018Well, Harold Insists on Having It!\u2019\u2014The Political Struggle to Establish The Open University, 1965\u201367.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 29.2 (2015): 241-272.</ref>\n\n====Vietnam War ====\nOverseas, Wilson was troubled by crises in  [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]]. The Vietnam War was a delicate issue, as President Lyndon Johnson urgently needed a symbolic British military presence. \"Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam,\" Wilson told his Cabinet in December 1964. Labour decided not to antagonize its strong antiwar element and refused Johnson's pleas.<ref>Sylvia A. Ellis, \"Promoting solidarity at home and abroad: the goals and tactics of the anti-Vietnam War movement in Britain.\" ''European Review of History: Revue europ\u00e9enne d\u2019histoire 21.4'' (2014): 557-576.</ref> However, Wilson provided the Americans with intelligence, military weapons, and jungle training, and allowed some 2000 British soldiers to volunteer for service in Vietnam.<ref>Marc Tiley, \"Britain, Vietnam and the Special Relationship,\" ''History Today'' 63#12 (2013) pp  1-4.</ref>\n\n====Industrial strike====\n{{See also|In Place of Strife}}\nIn addition to the damage done to its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the [[National Union of Seamen]], which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's own sense of insecurity in office.\n\n==Conservative Government, 1970\u201374==\n{{Further|Heath ministry}}\n[[File:Heathdod.JPG|thumb|[[Edward Heath]]]]\n\n===Edward Heath===\nThe premiership of his successor, [[Edward Heath|Sir Edward Heath]] was the bloodiest in the history of the [[Northern Ireland]] [[Troubles]]. He was prime minister at the time of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1972 when 14 unarmed men were killed by British soldiers during a banned [[civil rights]] march in [[Derry]]. In 2003, he gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and claimed that he never promoted or agreed to the use of unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland. In July 1972, he permitted his [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[William Whitelaw]] to hold unofficial talks in London with a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] delegation by [[Se\u00e1n Mac Stiof\u00e1in]]. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties. In 1974, the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] was produced but fiercely repudiated by many Unionists and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] ceased to support the Conservatives at Westminster.\n\nHeath took Britain into the [[EEC]] (later renamed The European Union) on 1 January 1973 after winning the decisive vote in the House by 336-244. It was, says biographer John Campbell, \"Heath's finest hour.\"<ref>John Campbell, ''Edward Heath'' (1993) p 404-5.</ref> Meanwhile, on the domestic front, galloping inflation led him into confrontation with some of the most powerful trade unions. Energy shortages related to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock]] resulted in much of the country's industry working a [[Three-Day Week]] to conserve power. In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives. Heath began negotiations with leaders of the Liberal Party to form a coalition, but, when these failed, resigned as Prime Minister.\n\n==Labour Government, 1974\u201379==\n{{Main|Labour government 1974\u201379}}\n\n===Harold Wilson (1974\u201376)===\nHeath was replaced by Harold Wilson, who returned on 4 March 1974 to form a minority government. Wilson was confirmed in office, with a three-seat majority, in a [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|second election in October of the same year]].<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Wilson: The Authorised Life'' (1993).</ref>  It was a manifesto pledge in the general election of February 1974 for a Labour government to re-negotiate better terms for Britain in the EEC, and then hold a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC on the new terms. After the House of Commons voted in favour of retaining the Common Market on the renegotiated terms, a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] was held on 5 June 1975. A majority were in favour of retaining the Common Market.<ref>Roy Pierce, Henry Valen, and Ola Listhaug. \"Referendum voting behaviour: The Norwegian and British referenda on membership in the European Community.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' (1983): 43-63. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111052 in JSTOR]</ref>  But Wilson was not able to end the economic crisis. Unemployment remained well in excess of 1,000,000, inflation peaked at 24% in 1975, and the national debt was increasing. The rise of punk rock bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]] were a reflection of the discontent felt by British youth during the difficulties of the late 1970s.\n\n===James Callaghan (1976\u201379)===\n[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Callaghan]]]]\nWilson announced his surprise resignation on 16 March 1976 and unofficially endorsed his Foreign Secretary [[James Callaghan]] as his successor. His broad popularity in many parts of the Labour movement saw him through [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|three ballots]] of Labour MPs, defeating the arch-Bevanite [[Michael Foot]], the main left-wing candidate. Callaghan was the first Prime Minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions \u2014 Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary \u2014 prior to becoming Prime Minister.<ref>[[Kenneth O. Morgan]], ''Callaghan: A Life'' (Oxford UP, 1997).</ref>\n\nCallaghan's support for and from the union movement should not be mistaken for a left wing position. Callaghan continued Wilson's policy of a balanced Cabinet and relied heavily on Michael Foot. Foot was made [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and given the task of steering through the government's legislative programme.\n\nCallaghan's time as Prime Minister was dominated by the troubles in running a Government with a minority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]; by-election defeats had wiped out Labour's three-seat majority by early 1977. Callaghan was forced to make deals with minor parties in order to survive, including the [[Lib-Lab pact]]. He had been forced to accept referendums on devolution in Scotland and Wales (the first went in favour but did not reach the required majority, and the second went heavily against).\n\nHowever, by the autumn of 1978 the economy was showing signs of recovery \u2013 although unemployment now stood at 1,500,000, economic growth was strong and inflation had fallen below 10%.<ref>biz/ed{{clarify|date=February 2018}}</ref> Most opinion polls were showing Labour ahead and he was expected to call an election before the end of the year. His decision not to has been described as the biggest mistake of his premiership.\n\nCallaghan's way of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success. He gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in 1979, and so attempted to hold pay rises to 5% or less. The Trade Unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]) secured higher pay, although it had virtually paralysed the country, tarnished Britain's political reputation and seen the Conservatives surge ahead in the opinion polls.<ref>John Shepherd, ''Crisis? What Crisis?: The Callaghan Government and the British 'winter of Discontent'. '' (Manchester University Press, 2013).</ref><ref>Colin Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\" ''The Political Quarterly'' 80.4 (2009): 545\u2013552.</ref>\n\nHe was forced to call an election when the House of Commons passed a [[Motion of No Confidence]] by one vote on 28 March 1979. The Conservatives, with advertising consultants [[Saatchi and Saatchi]], ran a campaign on the slogan \"Labour isn't working.\" As expected, [[Margaret Thatcher]] (who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in [[1975 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|February 1975]]) won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] held on 3 May, becoming Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nHistorian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] states:\n{{quote|The fall of James Callahan in the summer of 1979 meant, according to most commentators across the political spectrum, the end of an ''ancien r\u00e9gime,'' a system of corporatism, Keynesian spending programmes, subsidized welfare, and trade union power.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular ''modus vivendi'' with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.<ref>Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (4th ed. 1993)  p324.</ref>}}\n\n==Conservative Government, 1979\u201397==\n\n===Margaret Thatcher (1979\u201390)===\n{{Main|Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher ministry (disambiguation){{!}}Thatcher ministry}}\n[[File:Margaret Thatcher (1983).jpg|thumb|[[Margaret Thatcher]]]]\nThatcher formed a government on 4 May 1979, with a mandate to reverse the UK's economic decline and to reduce the role of the state in the economy. Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of Empire, and wanted the country to punch above its weight in international affairs. She was a philosophic soulmate with [[Ronald Reagan]], elected in 1980 in the United States, and to a lesser extent, [[Brian Mulroney]], who was elected in 1984 in Canada. It seemed for a time that conservatism might be the dominant political philosophy in the major English-speaking nations for the era.\n\n====Irish issues====\n{{See also|Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1980\u201389)}}\nNorthern Ireland was in a violent phase.<ref>Frank Gaffikin, ''Northern Ireland: The Thatcher Years'' (1989).</ref> Insurgents planted bombs and assassinated its foes, including in 1979 [[Airey Neave]], Thatcher's close friend who was slated to take charge there.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/260640 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThatcher continued the policy of \"Ulsterisation\" promoted by the previous Labour government, believing that the [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] of [[Ulster]] should be at the forefront in combating [[Irish republicanism]]. This meant relieving the burden on the mainstream [[British army]] and elevating the role of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=William J.

The [[Ulster Unionists]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]] made an electoral pact and on 23 January 1986, staged an ad-hoc referendum by re-fighting their seats in by-elections, and won with one seat lost to the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP). Then, unlike the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974, they found they could not bring the agreement down by a general strike. This was another effect of the changed balance of power in industrial relations. The Hillsborough agreement stood, and Thatcher punished the unionists for their non-cooperation by abolishing the devolved assembly she had created only four years before.<ref>{{cite book|author=Feargal Cochrane|title=Unionist Politics and the Politics of Unionism Since the Anglo-Irish Agreement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnAyhBCnpLQC&pg=PA16|year=1997|publisher=Cork UP|page=16|isbn=9781859181386}}</ref>\n\n====Economics====\nIn economic policy, Thatcher and her Chancellor Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] started out with policies, including higher interest rates, to [[Monetarism|drive down the rate of growth of the money supply]]. She had a preference for indirect taxation over taxes on income: in 1979 [[Exchange Control|exchange controls]] were abolished and the top rate of income tax on \"unearned\" income cut from 98% to 60%, but [[value added tax]] (VAT) was increased sharply to 15% with the result that inflation also rose. These moves hit businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, and [[unemployment]] \u2013 which had stood at 1,500,000 by the time of the 1979 general election \u2013 was above 2,000,000 by the end of 1980. It continued to rise throughout 1981, passing the 2,500,000 mark during the summer of that year \u2013 although inflation was now down to 12% compared to 27% two years earlier. The economy was now in [[Early 1980s recession|recession]].\n\nHer early tax policy reforms were based on the monetarist theories of [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]] rather than the [[supply-side economics]] of [[Art Laffer|Arthur Laffer]] and [[Jude Wanniski]], which the government of [[Ronald Reagan]] espoused. There was a severe recession in the early 1980s, and the Government's economic policy was widely blamed. In January 1982, the inflation rate dropped to single figures and interest rates fell. Unemployment peaked at 3.1 million and remained at that level until 1986.<ref>See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm \"1982: UK unemployment tops three million\" ''BBC: On This Day'']</ref>  The recession of the early 1980s was the deepest in Britain since the depression of the 1930s and Thatcher's popularity plummeted; most predictions had her losing the next election.\n\n====Falklands War====\n{{Main|Falklands War}}\n[[File:ARA General Belgrano underway.jpg|thumb|The British sank the Argentine cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano]] during the Falklands War.]]\n\nIn Argentina, an unstable military junta was in power and keen on reversing its huge economic unpopularity. On 2 April 1982, it invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], the only invasion of a British territory since World War II. [[History of the Falkland Islands|Argentina has claimed]] the islands since an 1830s dispute on their settlement. Thatcher sent a naval task force to recapture the Islands. The ensuing [[Falklands War]] saw the swift defeat of Argentina in only a few days of fighting, resulting in a wave of patriotic enthusiasm for Thatcher personally, at a time when her popularity had been at an all-time low for a serving Prime Minister. Opinion polls showed a huge surge in Conservative support which would be sufficient to win a general election. In the end, the war probably raised the Conservative vote by about six points, according to scholarly studies of the polling data.<ref>Helmut Norpoth,  \"The Falklands war and government popularity in Britain: Rally without consequence or surge without decline?.\" ''Electoral Studies'' 6.1 (1987): 3-16.</ref><ref>Harold D.

Thatcher negotiated directly in September 1982 with that country's leader [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>Chi-kwan Mark, \"To \u2018educate\u2019 Deng Xiaoping in capitalism: Thatcher\u2019s visit to China and the future of Hong Kong in 1982.\" ''Cold War History'' (2015): 1-20.</ref>  They agreed on the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration|Sino-British Joint Declaration over the Question of Hong Kong]] which provided for a peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to Beijing's control in 15 years' time, after which the city would be allowed to retain its \"capitalistic\" system for another 50 years.\n\nThatcher's strong opposition against communism as represented by the Soviet Union as well as the decisive military victory against Argentina, re-affirmed Britain's influential position on the world stage and bolstered Thatcher's firm leadership. In addition the economy was showing positive signs of recovery thanks mainly to substantial oil revenues from the [[North Sea]].<ref>James T. H. Tang,  \"From empire defence to imperial retreat: Britain's postwar China policy and the decolonization of Hong Kong.\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 28.02 (1994): 317-337.</ref>\n\n====Nuclear disarmament====\nThe 1983 election was also influenced by events in the opposition parties. Since their 1979 defeat, Labour was increasingly dominated by its \"[[hard left]]\" that had emerged from the 1970s union militancy, and in opposition its policies had swung very sharply to the left while the Conservatives had drifted further to the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. This drove a significant number of right wing Labour members and MPs to form a breakaway party in 1981, the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. Labour fought the election on [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|unilateral nuclear disarmament]], which proposed to abandon the British nuclear deterrent despite the threat from a nuclear armed Soviet Union, withdrawal from the [[European Community]], and total reversal of Thatcher's economic and trade union changes. Indeed, one Labour MP, [[Gerald Kaufman]], has called the party's 1983 manifesto \"the longest suicide note in history\". Consequently, upon the Labour split, there was a new centrist challenge, the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|Alliance]], from the Social Democrats in electoral pact with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], to break the major parties' dominance and win [[proportional representation]]. The British Electoral Study found that Alliance voters were preferentially tilted towards the Conservatives [https://web.archive.org/web/20071108021324/http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/voting/av_apend1.html], but this possible loss of vote share by the Conservatives was more than compensated for by the [[first past the post]] electoral system, where marginal changes in vote numbers and distribution have disproportionate effects on the number of seats won.  Accordingly, despite the Alliance vote share coming very close to that of Labour and preventing an absolute majority in votes for the Conservatives, the Alliance failed to break into Parliament in significant numbers and the Conservatives were returned in a landslide.\n\n====Trade union power====\nThatcher was committed to reducing the power of the [[trade union]]s but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched [[strike action|strike]]s that were wholly or partly aimed at damaging her politically.  The most significant of these was carried out by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM). However, Thatcher had made preparations long in advance for an NUM strike by building up coal stocks, and there were no cuts in electric power, unlike 1972. Police tactics during the strike concerned civil libertarians: stopping suspected strike sympathisers travelling towards coalfields when they were still long distances from them, phone tapping as evidenced by Labour's [[Tony Benn]], and a violent battle with mass pickets at Orgreave, Yorkshire. But images of massed militant miners using violence to prevent other miners from working, along with the fact that (illegally under a recent Act) the NUM had not held a national ballot to approve strike action. Scargill's policy of letting each region of the NUM call its own strike backfired when nine areas held ballots that resulted in majority votes against striking,<ref>[http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2008/11/04/great-miners-strike-1984-5-twelve-months-shook-britain-story-strike The Great Miners Strike 1984-5: Twelve Months that Shook Britain: the Story of the Strike, Workers' Liberty, written by Sean Matgamna and Martin Thomas, 4 November 2008]</ref> and violence against strikebreakers escalated with time until reaching a tipping point with the [[killing of David Wilkie]] (a taxi-driver who was taking a strikebreaker to work). The [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] lasted a full year, March 1984 until March 1985, before the drift of half the miners back to work forced the NUM leadership to give in without a deal. Thatcher had won a decisive victory and the unions never recovered their political power. This aborted political strike marked a turning point in UK politics: no longer could militant unions remove a democratically elected government. It also marked to beginning of a new economic and political culture in the UK based upon small government intervention in the economy and reduced dominance of the trade unions and welfare state.\n\n====Thatcher's political and economic philosophy====\n{{Further|Thatcherism}}\nThatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised [[free market]]s and entrepreneurialism. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small nationalised company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly large response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and sold off many of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of [[privatisation]], while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with Thatcherism.\n\n[[File:President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Camp David 1986.jpg|thumb|upright|Thatcher with President Ronald Reagan, 1986.]]\nIn the Cold War, Thatcher supported [[Reagan Doctrine|Ronald Reagan's policies]] of [[Rollback]] with the goal of reducing or ending Soviet Communist power.<ref>Sally-Ann Treharne, ''Reagan and Thatcher's Special Relationship'' (Edinburgh UP, 2015).</ref>  This contrasted with the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]] which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies still wedded to the idea of d\u00e9tente. US forces were permitted by Mrs. Thatcher to station nuclear [[cruise missile]]s at British bases, arousing mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], declaring she liked him and \"We can do business together\" after a meeting three months before he came to power in 1985. This was a start in swinging the West back to a new d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union in his era, as it proved to be an indication that the Soviet regime's power was decaying. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and voices who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and d\u00e9tente postures.\n\nShe supported the US bombing raid on [[Libya]] from bases in the UK in 1986 when other NATO allies would not. Her liking for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the [[Westland affair]] when she acted with colleagues to prevent the helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Aircraft|Westland]], a vital defence contractor, from linking with a European Consortium including the Italian firm [[Agusta]] in favour of a link with [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] of the United States. Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]], who had pushed the European Consortium, resigned in protest at her style of leadership, and thereafter became a potential leadership challenger. Trade and Industry Secretary [[Leon Brittan]] then had to resign for having ordered the leak of a confidential legal letter critical of Heseltine; Thatcher survived the crisis as her personal involvement in the leak was not proven.\n\nBy winning the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], on the economic boom (with unemployment finally falling below 3,000,000 that spring) and against a stubbornly anti-nuclear Labour opposition (now led by [[Neil Kinnock]] after [[Michael Foot|Michael Foot's]] resignation four years earlier), she became the longest serving [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] since the 1820s. Most newspapers supported her \u2014 with the exception of ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' \u2014 and were rewarded with regular press briefings by her press secretary, [[Bernard Ingham]].\n\nShe was known as \"Maggie\" in the popular tabloids, which inspired the well-known [[Maggie Out protest song|\"Maggie Out!\" protest song]], sung throughout that period by some of her opponents. Her unpopularity on the left is evident from the lyrics of several contemporary popular songs: \"Stand Down Margaret\" ([[The Beat (British band)|The Beat]]), \"Tramp the Dirt Down\" ([[Elvis Costello]]), \"Mother Knows Best\" ([[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]), and \"Margaret on the Guillotine\" ([[Morrissey]]).<ref>Matthew Worley, \"Shot by both sides: punk, politics and the end of \u2018consensus\u2019.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 26.3 (2012): 333-354.</ref>\n\nMany opponents believed she and her policies created a significant North-South divide from the [[Bristol Channel]] to [[The Wash]], between the \"haves\" in the economically dynamic south and the \"have nots\" in the northern rust belt.  Hard welfare reforms in her third term created an adult Employment Training system that included full-time work done for the dole plus a \u00a310 top-up, on the [[workfare]] model from the US. The \"Social Fund\" system that placed one-off welfare payments for emergency needs under a local budgetary limit, and where possible changed them into loans, and rules for assessing jobseeking effort by the week, were breaches of social consensus unprecedented since the 1920s.\n\nThe sharp fall in unemployment continued. By the end of 1987, it stood at just over 2,600,000 \u2013 having started the year still in excess of 3,000,000. It stood at just over 2,000,000 by the end of 1988, and by the end of 1989 less than 1,700,000 were unemployed. However, total economic growth for 1989 stood at 2% \u2013 the lowest since 1982 \u2013 signalling an end to the economic boom. Several other countries had now entered recession, and fears were now rife that Britain was also on the verge of another recession.<ref name=autogenerated1>Biz/ed{{clarify|date=February 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Thatcher, a trained chemist, became concerned with environmental issues, putting on the national agenda such technical issues as  [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[acid rain]].   In 1990, she opened the [[Hadley Centre]] for climate prediction and research.<ref>Jon Agar,  \"\u2018Future Forecast\u2014Changeable and Probably Getting Worse\u2019: The UK Government\u2019s Early Response to Anthropogenic Climate Change.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 26.4 (2015): 602-628; Andrew Blowers, \"Transition or Transformation?\u2010Environmental Policy Under Thatcher.\" ''Public Administration'' 65.3 (1987): 277-294.\n</ref>\n\nIn September 1988, at [[Bruges, Belgium|Bruges]], Thatcher announced her opposition to proposals from the [[European Community]] for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making. Although she had supported British membership, Thatcher believed that the role of the EC should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that new EC regulations would reverse the changes she was making in the UK. \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a new super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\". The speech caused an outcry from other European leaders, and exposed for the first time the deep split that was emerging over European policy inside her Conservative Party. Since 1985 Thatcher had been blocking British membership of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM), a preparation for [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]], through which a single currency would replace national currencies, which the EC began seriously to discuss by 1990.\n\nThatcher's popularity once again declined in 1989 as the economy suffered from high interest rates imposed to stop an unsustainable [[Boom and bust|boom]]. She blamed her Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], who had exacerbated the boom by trying to keep the pound sterling low (\"shadowing the Deutschmark\") as a preparation for ERM membership; Thatcher claimed not to have been told of this and did not approve. At the [[Madrid]] European summit, Lawson and Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] forced Thatcher to agree the circumstances under which she would join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Thatcher took revenge on both by demoting Howe, and by listening more to her adviser Sir [[Alan Walters]] on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.\n\nThat November, Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by Sir [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Meyer]]. As Meyer was a virtually unknown [[backbencher|backbench]] MP, he was viewed as a [[stalking horse]] candidate for more prominent members of the party.  Thatcher easily defeated Meyer's challenge, but there were 60 ballot papers either cast for Meyer or abstaining, a surprisingly large number for a sitting Prime Minister.\n\nThatcher's new system to replace local government rates was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales in 1990. Rates were replaced by the \"Community Charge\" (more widely known as the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]), which applied the same amount to every individual resident, with only limited discounts for low earners. This was to be the most universally unpopular policy of her premiership, and saw the Conservative government split further behind the Labour opposition (still led by Neil Kinnock) in the opinion polls. The Charge was introduced early in Scotland as the rateable values would in any case have been reassessed in 1989. However, it led to accusations that Scotland was a 'testing ground' for the tax. Thatcher apparently believed that the new tax would be popular, and had been persuaded by Scottish Conservatives to bring it in early and in one go. Despite her hopes, the early introduction led to a sharp decline in the already low support for the Conservative party in Scotland.\n\nAdditional problems emerged when many of the tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions.  Some have argued that local councils saw the introduction of the new system of taxation as the opportunity to make significant increases in the amount taken, assuming (correctly) that it would be the originators of the new tax system and not its local operators who would be blamed.\n\nA large London demonstration against the poll tax in [[Trafalgar Square]] on 31 March 1990 \u2014 the day before it was introduced in England and Wales \u2014 turned into a [[Poll tax riots|riot]]. Millions of people resisted paying the tax. Opponents of the tax banded together to resist [[bailiff]]s and disrupt court hearings of poll tax debtors. Mrs Thatcher refused to compromise, or change the tax, and its unpopularity was a major factor in Thatcher's downfall.\n\nBy the autumn of 1990, opposition to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (especially high interest rates of 15%, which were undermining her core voting base within the home-owning, entrepreneurial and business sectors), and the divisions opening within her party over the appropriate handling of [[European integration]] made Thatcher and her party seem increasingly politically vulnerable. Her increasingly combative, irritable personality also made opposition to her grow fast and by this point, even many in her own party could not stand her.\n\n===John Major (1990\u201397)===\n{{Further|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|[[John Major]]]]\nIn November 1990, [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party. Thatcher fell short of the required 15% majority in the first round and was persuaded to withdraw from the second round on 22 November, ending her 11-year premiership. Her Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Major]] contested the second round and defeated Michael Heseltine as well as Foreign Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], becoming prime minister on 27 November 1990.<ref>Philip Cowley and John Garry, \"The British conservative party and Europe: the choosing of John major.\" ''British Journal of Political Science'' 28#3 (1998): 473-499, on how Major won.</ref>\n\nBy this stage, however, Britain had slid into [[Early 1990s|recession]] for the third time in less than 20 years. Unemployment had started to rise in the spring of 1990 but by the end of the year it was still lower than in many other European economies, particularly France and Italy.\n\n[[File:British gulf war.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British troops in the Gulf]]\nJohn Major was Prime Minister during British involvement in the [[Gulf War]]. Polls improved for the Conservatives despite the recession deepening throughout 1991 and into 1992, with the economy for 1991 falling 2% and unemployment passing the 2,000,000 mark.<ref>Dennis Kavanagh and Anthony Seldon, eds., ''The Major Effect: An Overview of John Major's Premiership'' (1994)</ref>  Major called a [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for April 1992 and took his campaign onto the streets, famously delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox as in his Lambeth days. This populist \"common touch\", in contrast to the Labour Party's more slick campaign, chimed with the electorate and Major won, albeit with a small parliamentary majority.<ref>Peter Dorey, ''The Major Premiership: Politics and Policies under John Major, 1990\u201397'' (1999)</ref>\n\nThe narrow majority for the Conservative government proved to be unmanageable, particularly after the United Kingdom's forced exit from the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] on [[Black Wednesday]] (16 September 1992) just five months into the new parliament. From this stage onwards, Labour \u2013 now led by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] \u2013 was ascendant in the opinion polls. Major allowed his economic team to stay in place unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before forcing the resignation of his Chancellor, [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], whom he replaced with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This delay was seen as indicative of one of his weaknesses, an indecisiveness towards personnel issues that was to undermine his authority through the rest of his premiership.<ref name=\"Dorey, 1999\">Dorey, ''The Major Premiership: Politics and Policies under John Major, 1990\u201397'' (1999)</ref>\n\nAt the 1993 Conservative Party Conference, Major began his ill-fated  \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to be about the economy, education, policing, and other such issues, but it was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) as an attempt to revert to the moral and family values that the Conservative Party were often associated with. A number of sleaze scandals involving Conservative MP's were exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail in tabloid newspapers following this and further reduced the Conservative's popularity. Despite Major's best efforts, the Conservative Party collapsed into political infighting. Major took a moderate approach but found himself undermined by the right-wing within the party and the Cabinet.\n\nMajor's policy towards the [[European Union]] aroused opposition as the Government attempted to ratify the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Although the Labour opposition supported the treaty, they were prepared to undertake tactical moves to weaken the government, which included passing an amendment that required a vote on the social chapter aspects of the treaty before it could be ratified. Several Conservative MPs (the [[Maastricht Rebels]]) voted against the Government and the vote was lost. Major hit back by calling another vote on the following day (23 July 1993), which he declared a [[vote of confidence]]. He won by 40 but had damaged his authority.<ref name=\"Dorey, 1999\"/>\n\nOne of the few bright spots of 1993 for the Conservative government came in April when the end of the recession was finally declared after nearly three years.  Unemployment had touched 3,000,000 by the turn of the year, but had dipped to 2,800,000 by Christmas as the economic recovery continued.   The economic recovery was strong and sustained throughout 1994, with unemployment falling below 2,500,000 by the end of the year.  However, Labour remained ascendant in the opinion polls and their popularity further increased with the election of [[Tony Blair]] \u2013 who redesignated the party as [[New Labour]] \u2013 as leader following the sudden death of John Smith on 12 May 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}</ref> Labour remained ascendant in the polls throughout 1995, despite the Conservative government overseeing the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/chron/kf1995.htm |title=Key Facts on 1995 |publisher=Biz/ed |date=26 May 1999 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> It was a similar story throughout 1996, despite the economy still being strong and unemployment back below 2,000,000 for the first time since early 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/chron/kf1996.htm |title=Key Facts on 1996 |publisher=Biz/ed |date=26 May 1999 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref>  The [[Railways Act 1993]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/43/contents/enacted|title=Railways Act 1993 (as enacted)|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref> was introduced by John Major's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government and passed on 5 November 1993. It provided for the restructuring of the [[British Railways Board]] (BRB), the public corporation that owned and operated the national railway system.  A few residual responsibilities of the BRB remained with [[BRB (Residuary) Ltd.]]\n\nFew were surprised when Major lost the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] to [[Tony Blair]], though the immense scale of the defeat was not widely predicted. In the new parliament Labour won 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, leaving the Labour party with a majority of 179 which was the biggest majority since [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]]. In addition, the Conservatives lost all their seats in Scotland and Wales and several cabinet ministers including [[Michael Portillo]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Ian Lang]] lost their seats, as did former cabinet minister [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]]. Major carried on as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] until [[William Hague]] was elected to lead the Conservative Party the month after the election.<ref>Michael Foley, ''John Major, Tony Blair & a Conflict of Leadership: Collision Course'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==Labour Government, 1997\u20132010==\n{{See also|New Labour}}\n\n===Tony Blair (1997\u20132007)===\n{{Main|Premiership of Tony Blair|Blair ministry}}\n[[File:TonyBlairBasra.JPG|thumb|[[Tony Blair]]]]\nTony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 after a [[1997 United Kingdom general election|landslide victory]] over the Conservative Party. Under the title of ''[[New Labour]]'', he promised economic and social reform and brought Labour closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] of the political spectrum. Early policies of the Blair government included the [[minimum wage]] and the introduction of university [[tuition fees]]. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] also gave the [[Bank of England]] the power to set the base rate of interest autonomously. The traditional tendency of governments to manipulate interest rates around the time of general elections for political gain is thought to have been deleterious to the UK economy and helped reinforce a cyclical pattern of [[boom and bust]]. Brown's decision was popular with [[City of London|the City]], which the Labour Party had been courting since the early 1990s. Blair presided over the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century and his premiership saw large investment into social aspects, in particular health and education, areas particularly under-invested during the Conservative government of the 1980s and early 1990s. The [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] was introduced in 1998 and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] came into force in 2000. Most hereditary peers were removed from the [[House of Lords]] in 1999 and the [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|Civil Partnership Act]] of 2005 allowed [[homosexual]] couples the right to register their partnership with the same rights and responsibilities comparable to heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe nation was stunned when Princess Diana [[death of Princess Diana|died in a car accident in Paris]] on 31 August 1997, even though she had divorced Prince Charles a few years earlier. Numerous conspiracy theories arose about her being assassinated due to her plans to marry an Muslim businessman, although nothing was ever proven.\n\nFrom the beginning, New Labour's record on the economy and unemployment was strong, suggesting that they could break with the trend of Labour governments overseeing an economic decline while in power. They had inherited an unemployment count of 1,700,000 from the Conservatives, and by the following year unemployment was down to 1,300,000 \u2013 a level not seen since [[James Callaghan]] was in power some 20 years previously. A minimum wage was announced in May 1998, coming into force from April 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/chron/kf1998.htm |title=Key Facts on 1998 |publisher=Biz/ed |date=26 May 1999 |accessdate=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929212354/http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/chron/kf1998.htm |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Unemployment would remain similarly low for the next 10 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10604117 | publisher=BBC News | title=Economy tracker | date=19 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TonyBlairArmagh1998.jpg|thumb|left|Blair addresses Armagh in 1998]]\nThe long-running [[Northern Ireland peace process]] was brought to a conclusion in 1998 with the [[Belfast Agreement]] which established a devolved [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and de-escalated the violence associated with [[the Troubles]]. It was signed in April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and was endorsed by all the main political parties in Northern Ireland with the exception of [[Ian Paisley]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. Voters in Northern Ireland approved the agreement in a referendum in May 1998 and it came into force in December 1999. In August 1998, a car-bomb [[Omagh bombing|exploded]] in the Northern Ireland town of [[Omagh]], killing 29 people and injuring 220. The attack was carried out by the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] who opposed the Belfast Agreement. It was reported in 2005, that the IRA had renounced violence and had ditched its entire arsenal.\n\nIn foreign policy, following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, Blair greatly supported [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s new [[War on Terror]] which began with the forced withdrawal of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]]. Blair's case for the subsequent war in Iraq was based on their alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's weapons of mass destruction]]. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that \"the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so\". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the \"[[Iraq Dossier|Dodgy Dossier]]\".\n\n[[File:Operation Sond Chara 02.jpg|thumb|British troops in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghan War]].]]\n46,000 British troops, one-third of the total strength of the [[British Army]] (land forces), were deployed to assist with the invasion of Iraq. When after the war, no WMDs were found in Iraq, the two dossiers, together with Blair's other pre-war statements, became an issue of considerable controversy. Many Labour Party members, including a number who had supported the war, were among the critics. Successive independent inquiries (including those by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons, the senior judge Lord Hutton, and the former senior civil servant Lord Butler of Brockwell) have found that Blair honestly stated what he believed to be true at the time, though Lord Butler's report did imply that the Government's presentation of the intelligence evidence had been subject to some degree of exaggeration. These findings have not prevented frequent accusations that Blair was deliberately deceitful, and, during the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election campaign]], Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] made political capital out of the issue. The new threat of international terrorism ultimately led to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005 bomb attacks]] in London which killed 52 people as well as the four suicide bombers who led the attack.\n\nThe Labour government was re-elected with a second successive landslide in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|general election]] of June 2001.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}</ref> Blair became the first Labour leader to lead the party to three successive election victories when they won the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], though this time he had a drastically reduced majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519863.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Blair secures historic third term | date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives had so far failed to represent a serious challenge to Labour's rule, with John Major's successor William Hague unable to make any real improvement upon the disastrous 1997 general election result at the next election four years later. He stepped down after the 2001 election to be succeeded by [[Iain Duncan Smith]], who did not even hold the leadership long enough to contest a general election \u2013 being ousted by his own MP's in October 2003<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3225127.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Tory leader ousted | date=29 October 2003}}</ref> and being replaced by [[Michael Howard]], who had served as [[Home Secretary]] in the government of John Major. Howard failed to win the 2005 general election for the Conservatives but he at least had the satisfaction of narrowing the Labour majority, giving his successor (he announced his resignation shortly after the election) a decent platform to build upon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3245561.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Howard crowned Tory leader | date=6 November 2003}}</ref> However, the Conservatives began to re-emerge as an electable prospect following the election of [[David Cameron]] as Howard's successor in December 2005. Within months of Cameron becoming Conservative leader, opinion polls during 2006 were showing a regular Conservative lead for the first time since Black Wednesday 14 years earlier. Despite the economy still being strong and unemployment remaining low, Labour's decline in support was largely blamed upon poor control of immigration and allowing Britain to become what was seen by many as an easy target for terrorists.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/22/uk.topstories3 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Julian | last=Glover | title=Tories open nine-point lead as Labour drops to 19-year low | date=22 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Devolution for Scotland and Wales====\nBlair also came into power with a policy of [[devolution]]. A pre-legislative [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum]] was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions:  whether to create a devolved [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] for Scotland and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. Following a clear 'yes' vote on both questions, a [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum]] on the proposal for creating a devolved [[Welsh Assembly|Assembly]] was held two weeks later. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. The [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first election to the Scottish parliament]] saw the creation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition with [[Donald Dewar]] as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]]. In Wales, the Labour Party achieved a complete majority with [[Alun Michael]] as the [[First Minister for Wales|Welsh First Minister]]. In the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish election]], the [[Scottish National Party]] gained enough seats to form a minority government with its leader [[Alex Salmond]] as First Minister.\n\nDevolution also returned to [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], leaving England as the only constituent [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country of the United Kingdom]] without a devolved administration. Within England, a devolved authority for [[London Assembly|London]] was re-established following a 'yes' vote in a London-wide referendum.\n\nOn 18 September 2014, [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|a referendum on Scottish independence]] failed with a 55/44 percentage.\n\n===Gordon Brown (2007\u201310)===\n{{Main|Premiership of Gordon Brown|Brown ministry}}\n[[File:Gordon_Brown_official.jpg|thumb|[[Gordon Brown]]]]\n\nTony Blair tendered his resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the Queen on 27 June 2007, his successor [[Gordon Brown]] assuming office the same afternoon. Brown took over as Prime Minister without having to face either a general election or a contested election for leadership of the Labour Party.\n\nBrown's style of government differed from that of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had been seen as presidential. Brown rescinded some of the policies which had either been introduced or were planned by Blair's administration. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the Iraq war, although he established an inquiry into the reasons why Britain had participated in the conflict. He proposed a \"government of all the talents\" which would involve co-opting leading personalities from industry and other professional walks of life into government positions. Brown also appointed [[Jacqui Smith]] as the UK's first female Home Secretary, while Brown's old position as Chancellor was taken over by [[Alistair Darling]].\n\nBrown was closer to American thinking, and more distant from Europe, than Blair. In major issues with foreign policy complications, He paid close attention to both the United States and the EU, especially regarding the deregulation of the Bank of England, the Welfare to Work program, and his response to the worldwide financial crisis at the G20 summit in London in 2009. Brown decided in 1997 to follow the American model and grant operational independence to set interest rates  to the [[Bank of England]], rather than have the power remain with the Treasury. He explained the Bank's monetary policy objective \"will be to deliver price stability and...to support the Government's economic policy.\"<ref>Philip Gannon,  \"Between America and Europe: Transatlantic influences on the policies of Gordon Brown.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 13.1 (2015): 1-19, quote p 5.</ref>  Brown argued for a neoliberal policy on welfare in 1997. His goal was to move people off welfare and into actual employment. He stated: \n{{quote|We cannot build a dynamic economy unless we can unleash the potential and everyone. A welfare state that thwarts the opportunities that we need to hold the economy back. A welfare state that encourages work is not only fair but makes for greater dynamism in the economy.<ref>Gannon,  \"Between America and Europe\" p 9</ref>}}\nBrown's reaction to the great 2008 banking crisis was much more pro active than France or Germany, and in many ways resembled the Bush policies in Washington. Brown's goals were to provide more liquidity to the financial system, to recapitalise the banks and to guarantee bank debt. He lowered the VAT to encourage consumer spending and to keep the economy from sinking.<ref>Gannon,  \"Between America and Europe\" p 12</ref>\n\nBrown's rise to prime minister sparked a brief surge in Labour support as the party topped most opinion polls. There was talk of a \"snap\" general election, which it was widely believed Labour could win, but Brown decided against calling an election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7031749.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Brown rules out autumn election | date=6 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nBrown's government introduced a number of fiscal policies to help keep the British economy afloat during the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial crisis]] which occurred throughout the latter part of the 2000s (decade) and early 2010, although the United Kingdom saw a dramatic increase in its national debt. Unemployment soared through 2008 as the [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] set in, and Labour standings in the opinion polls plummeted as the Conservatives became ascendant.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/2462085/Fresh-blow-for-Gordon-Brown-as-Conservatives-sweep-marginals-in-new-poll.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Hennessy | title=Fresh blow for Gordon Brown as Conservatives sweep marginals in new poll | date=26 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nSeveral major banks were nationalised after falling into financial difficulties, while large amounts of money were pumped into the economy to encourage spending. Brown was also press ganged into giving [[Gurkha]]s settlement rights in Britain by the actress and campaigner [[Joanna Lumley]] and attracted criticism for its handling of the [[Release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohamed Al Megrahi|release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi]], the only person to have been convicted over the [[Pan Am Flight 103|1988 Lockerbie bombing]].\n\nFurther European integration was introduced under the Labour governments after 1997, including the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] (1997) and the [[Treaty of Nice]] (2001). The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] (2007)introduced many further changes.  Prominent changes included more [[qualified majority voting]] in the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], increased involvement of the [[European Parliament]] in the legislative process through extended [[Codecision procedure|codecision]] with the Council of Ministers, eliminating the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar system]] established by the Maastricht Treaty of the early 1990s and the creation of a [[President of the European Council]] with a term of two and a half years and a [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] to present a united position on EU policies. The Treaty of Lisbon will also make the Union's human rights charter, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]], legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty also leads to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the [[Treaty of Lisbon#Council|Council of the European Union]] from 8.4% to 12.4%. In July 2008 the Labour government under [[Gordon Brown]] approved the treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7511281.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK ratifies the EU Lisbon Treaty|date=17 July 2008|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially, during the first four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a solid lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may be due to his handling of numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity had fallen significantly, with two contributing factors believed to be his perceived change of mind over plans to call a snap general election in October 2007, and his handling of the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and dithering. His unpopularity led eight labour MPs to call for a leadership contest in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to his perceived strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit an all-time low, and his position became increasingly under threat after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009 [[2009 United Kingdom local elections|Local]] and [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections]]. Brown's cabinet began to rebel with several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009.\n\nIn January 2010, it was revealed that Britain's economy had resumed growth after a recession which had seen a record six successive quarters of economic detraction. However, it was a narrow return to growth, and it came after the other major economies had come out of recession.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8479639.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=UK economy emerges from recession | date=27 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] \u2013 Britain's first for 36 years \u2013 with the Conservative Party controlling 306 Seats, the Labour Party 258 Seats and the Liberal Democrats 57 Seats. Brown remained as prime minister while the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] negotiated with Labour and the Conservatives to form a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 in order to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely, and on 11 May Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party. This paved the way for the Conservatives to return to power after 13 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8675265.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Cameron is new UK prime minister | date=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nHis deputy [[Harriet Harman]] became Leader of the Opposition until September 2010, when [[Ed Miliband]] was elected Leader of the Labour Party.\n\n==Coalition Government, 2010\u201315==\n{{Main|Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Premiership of David Cameron}}\n{{See also|Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition agreement}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | image1    = David Cameron - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2010.jpg\n | alt1      = David Cameron\n | caption1  = [[David Cameron]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) was Prime Minister (senior coalition partner)\n | image2    = Nick Clegg by the 2009 budget cropped.jpg\n | alt2      = Nick Clegg\n | caption2  = [[Nick Clegg]] ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) was [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] (junior coalition partner)\n}}\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the 2010 general election but did not win enough seats to win an outright majority. [[David Cameron]], who had led the party since 2005 became Prime Minister on 11 May 2010 after the Conservatives formed a [[coalition government]] with the Liberal Democrats. [[Nick Clegg]], leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and several other Liberal Democrats were given cabinet positions. Cameron promised to reduce Britain's spiralling budget deficit by cutting back on public service spending and by transferring more power to local authorities. He committed his government to Britain's continuing role in Afghanistan and stated that he hopes to remove British troops from the region by 2015. An [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget|emergency budget]] was prepared in June 2010 by Chancellor of the Exchequer [[George Osborne]] which stated that VAT will be raised to 20% and there will be a large reduction in public spending. A key Liberal Democrat policy is that of voting reform, to which a [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum]] took place in May 2011 on whether or not Britain should adopt a system of [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] to elect MPs to Westminster. However, the proposal was rejected overwhelmingly, with 68% of voters in favour of retaining first-past-the-post.  The Liberal Democrat turnabout on tuition policy at the universities alienated their younger supporters, and the continuing weakness of the economy, despite spending cutbacks, alienated the elders.\n\nIn March 2011, UK, along with France and USA voted for military intervention against Gaddafi's Libya leading to [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. Prince William married Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011 in a globally televised event much like his parents' wedding 30 years earlier. In July 2013, the royal couple welcomed their first child, Prince George. In May 2015, they welcomed their second child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.

The United States claimed the largest count of gold medals, with Britain running third place after China.\n\nIn 2014, Scotland [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|voted in a referendum]] on the question of becoming an independent country. The No side, supported by the three major UK parties, secured a 55% to 45% majority for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Following the result on 18 September 2014, Scotland's First Minister, [[Alex Salmond]], announced his intention to step down as First Minister and leader of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]. He was replaced by his deputy, [[Nicola Sturgeon]].\n\n==Conservative Government, 2015\u2013present==\n\n===David Cameron (2015\u201316)===\n{{Main|Second Cameron ministry}}\nAfter years of austerity, the British economy was on an upswing in 2015. In line with the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] was called for 7 May 2015. The Conservatives claimed credit for the upswing, promising to keep taxes low and reduce the deficit as well as promising an In/Out referendum on the UK's relationship with the European Union. The rival Labour party called for a higher minimum wage, and higher taxes on the rich. In Scotland, the SNP attacked the austerity programme, opposed nuclear weapons and demanded that promises of more autonomy for Scotland made during the independence referendum be delivered.\n\nPre-election polls had predicted a close race and a hung parliament, but the surprising result was that a majority Conservative government was elected. The Conservatives with 37% of the popular vote held a narrow majority with 331 of the 650 seats. The other main victor was the [[Scottish National Party]] which won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. Labour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and 232 seats; they lost 40 of their 41 seats in Scotland. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] vote fell by 2/3 and they lost 49 of their 57 seats, as their coalition with the Conservatives had alienated the great majority of their supporters. The new [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), rallying voters against Europe and against immigration, did well with 13% of the vote count. It came in second in over 115 constituencies but came in first in only one.

The [[Bank of England]], railways, heavy industry, and coal mining were all [[Nationalization|nationalised]]. The most controversial issue was nationalisation of steel, which was profitable unlike the others. Economic recovery was slow, housing was in short supply, bread was rationed along with many necessities in short supply. It was an \"age of austerity\". American loans and Marshall Plan grants kept the economy afloat. India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon gained independence. Britain was a strong anti-Soviet factor in the [[Cold War]] and helped found [[NATO]] in 1949.\n\nThe Labour Party introduced charges for NHS dental services and glasses in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/nhs_at_50/special_report/121091.stm|title=Special report Handle with care|last=Assinder|first=Nick|date=1 July 1998|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, 'Aneurin Bevan' in Kevin Jeffreys (ed.), ''Labour Forces: From Ernie Bevin to Gordon Brown'' (I.B. Tauris: London & New York, 2002), pp. 91-92.</ref> The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] returned to power in 1951, accepting most of Labour's postwar reforms, but introduced prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalized steel in 1953. They presided over 13 years of economic recovery and stability. However the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 demonstrated Britain was no longer a [[superpower]]. [[Ghana]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Kenya]] were granted independence during this period. Labour returned to power under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964 and oversaw a series of social reforms including the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the relaxing of divorce laws and the end of capital punishment. [[Edward Heath]] returned the Conservatives to power from 1970 to 1974, and oversaw the decimalisation of British currency, the accession of Britain to the [[European Economic Community]], and the height of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. In the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]] and a miner's strike, Heath introduced the three-day working week to conserve power.\n\nLabour made a return to power in 1974 but a series of strikes carried out by trade unions over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]) paralysed the country and as Labour lost its majority in parliament, a general election was called in 1979 which took [[Margaret Thatcher]] to power and began 18 years of Conservative government. Victory in the [[Falklands War]] (1982) and the government's strong opposition to trade unions helped lead the Conservative Party to another three terms in government. Thatcher initially pursued [[monetarism|monetarist]] policies and went on to privatise many of Britain's nationalised companies such as [[British Telecom]], [[British Gas Corporation]], [[British Airways]] and [[British Steel Corporation]]. She kept the National Health Service.  The controversial [[Community Charge]] (commonly called the \"Poll Tax\"), used to fund local government was unpopular and the Conservatives removed Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990.\n\nThatcher's successor [[John Major]] replaced the Poll Tax with the [[Council Tax]] and oversaw successful British involvement in the [[Gulf War]]. Despite a recession, Major led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in 1992. The events of [[Black Wednesday]] in 1992, party disunity over the [[European Union]] and several scandals involving Conservative politicians led to Labour under [[Tony Blair]] winning a landslide election victory in 1997. Labour had shifted its policies closer to the political centre, under the new slogan 'New Labour'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were given a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] respectively. A devolved power sharing [[Northern Ireland Executive]] was established in 1998, believed by many to be the end of The Troubles.\n\nBlair led Britain into the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] before leaving office in 2007, when he was succeeded by his Chancellor, [[Gordon Brown]]. A [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global recession in 2008\u201310]] led to Labour's defeat in the 2010 election. It was replaced by a Conservative-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] coalition, headed by [[David Cameron]], that pursued a series of public spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit. In June 2016, the UK [[Brexit|voted to leave the European Union]], which led to Cameron's resignation. Cameron was succeeded by his Home Secretary, [[Theresa May]].\n\nMay engaged in a policy to take the country out of the European Union with her flagship [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. With this deal having failed in the House of Commons three times, May resigned. A [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative leadership election]] ensued, which former [[Foreign Secretary]] and [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]] won. On the 24th July 2019, Johnson was appointed Prime Minister.\n\n==Labour Government, 1945\u201351==\n{{Further|Attlee ministry}}\n[[File:Attlee BW cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Clement Attlee]]]]\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the landslide [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] returned the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to power and [[Clement Attlee]] became Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Butler|1989|p=5}} The party quickly nationalised critical sectors of the economy, especially declining industries. The [[Bank of England]] was [[nationalisation|nationalised]] along with railways (see [[Transport Act 1947]]), coal mining, public utilities and heavy industry. The most controversial case was the takeover of the highly profitable{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} iron and steel industry, which was opposed and finally reversed by the Conservatives.<ref>Kenneth O.

In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate [[pension]]s, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income.<ref>Morgan, ''Labour in Power, 1945-1951'' (1985) pp. 142-87.</ref>\n\nIn the estimation of historians, and later politicians of the major parties, the most successful and permanent program was the creation of a [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] which started operations in 1947.<ref>Morgan, ''Labour in Power, 1945-1951'' (1985) pp. 152-63.</ref> It entitled all citizens to healthcare, which, funded by taxation, was free at the point of delivery. The opposition from physicians was bought off by allowing them to keep lucrative private practices on the side.  All hospitals were nationalized and brought into the system. John Carrier and Ian Kendall find that the mission for Minister of Health [[Aneurin Bevan]] was resolving \"The potential conflict between the aim of providing a universalist, comprehensive health service of a good standard and that of containing health costs to a reasonable level, and how to finance the system in such a way that certainty and sufficiency of funds could be guaranteed.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=John Carrier and Ian Kendall|title=Health and the National Health Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9CPCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT61|year=2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=61|isbn=9781135310950}}</ref> [[Michael Foot]] adds that Bevan had to persuade \"the most conservative and respected profession in the country to accept and operate the Labour government's most intrinsically socialist proposition.<ref>Michael Foot, ''Aneurin Bevan'' (1975) 2: 105</ref>  In the end historians give Bevan the major credit for the success.<ref>Frank Honigsbaum, ''Health, happiness, and security: the creation of the National Health Service'' (1989).</ref>\n\nOne of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour ''shortages'' proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\nDespite the heavy American grants of [[Lend Lease]] food oil and munitions (which did not have to be repaid) plus American loans, and a grant of money and loans from Canada at the end of the war Britain was on the verge of bankruptcy.

With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible.

None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated.<ref>Chandler, David ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 331</ref> The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947.

A major reason that Churchill was in the wilderness during the 1930s was his refusal to support the Conservative position in favor of independence for India. Independence strengthened the Commonwealth, and had a valuable impact on the British economy, with large sums transferring back and forth, as well as fresh migrants arriving from India. In sharp contrast, France felt humiliated by its loss of its colonies, especially Algeria and Vietnam. The success  in India encouraged and embolden the development programs of ambitious young British colonial officials in Africa and the rest of Asia.<ref>Kenneth O.

These funds came through the [[Marshall Plan]] and did not have to be repaid, however they carried the proviso that Britain modernize the management of its major corporations. The aid permitted Britain to provide consumption at tolerable levels despite the austerity.

His third government \u2014 after the wartime national government and the short caretaker government of 1945 \u2014 would last until his resignation in 1955. During this period he renewed what he called the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States, and engaged himself in the formation of the post-war order.\n\nHis domestic priorities were, however, overshadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power.  Being a strong proponent of Britain as an international power, Churchill would often meet such moments with direct action.\n\nIn February 1952, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] died and was succeeded by his eldest daughter [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]]. Her [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]] on 2 June 1953 gave the British people a renewed sense of national pride and enthusiasm which had been lowered by the war.

The International Court of Justice was called in to settle the dispute, but a 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement, with recognition of nationalisation, was rejected by Mossadegh.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerome B.

When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the Mau Mau rebellion in 1952. On 17 August 1952, a state of emergency was declared, and British troops were flown to [[Kenya]] to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the ferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil war.\n\n====Malayan Emergency====\n{{main|Malayan Emergency}}\nIn [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948, led by Communists based in the local Chinese community.  Once again, Churchill's government inherited a crisis, and once again Churchill chose to use direct military action against those in rebellion while attempting to build an alliance with those who were not. He stepped up the implementation of a \"hearts and minds\" campaign and approved the creation of fortified villages, a tactic that would become a recurring part of Western military strategy in South-East Asia, especially in the American role in the  [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Richard Stubbs, ''Hearts and Minds in Guerrilla Warfare: The Malayan Emergency 1948-1960'' (1989).</ref><ref>Karl Hack, (1999) \"'Iron claws on Malaya': the historiography of the Malayan Emergency.\" ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'' 30#1 (1999): 99-125.</ref>\n\n===Anthony Eden (1955\u201357)===\n{{Further|Eden ministry}}\n[[File:Anthony Eden (retouched).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Eden]]]]\n\n====Suez crisis====\n{{main|Suez crisis}}\nIn April 1955, Churchill finally retired, and [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]] succeeded him as Prime Minister. Eden was a very popular figure, as a result of his long wartime service and also his famous good looks and charm. On taking office he immediately called a [[1955 United Kingdom general election|general election]], at which the Conservatives were returned with an increased majority. He left domestic issues to his lieutenants such as [[Rab Butler]], and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close alliance with US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]].<ref>Kevin Ruane, \"Anglo-American relations, the cold war and Middle East defence, 1953\u20131955.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 4#1 (2006): 1-25.</ref>\n\nOn 26 July 1956 [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], President of Egypt, nationalised the [[Suez Canal]] company, in violation of the international agreement he had signed with the UK in 1954. It had been owned and controlled by Britain since 1875 and was seen as essential to national defence and access to the Far East. Eden drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] who had to be stopped. In November 1956, after months of negotiation and attempts at mediation had failed to dissuade Nasser, Britain and France, in conjunction with Israel, invaded Egypt and occupied the Suez Canal Zone.\n\nEisenhower had warned Eden not to do it, saying the American people would never approve of a military solution to the crisis.<ref>Jonathan Pearson, ''Sir Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis: Reluctant Gamble'' (Springer, 2002).

Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US in the wake of World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.<ref>G.C.

He brought the economic concerns of the exchequer into the premiership, but his approach to the economy was to seek high employment; whereas his treasury ministers argued that to support the Bretton-Wood's requirement on the pound sterling would require strict control of the money base, and hence a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958, all the Treasury ministers resigned. Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bogdanor|first=Vernon|title=Harold Macmillan {{!}} Obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1986/dec/30/obituaries|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 May 2013|location=London|date=1 July 2005}}</ref>\n\nMacmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as part of his growth without inflation policy; it failed when the unions boycotted it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black|title=The Tory World: Deep History and the Tory Theme in British Foreign Policy, 1679-2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9mqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA343|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=343|isbn=9781317013785}}</ref>\n\nOne of Macmillan's more noteworthy actions was the [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|end of conscription]]. National Service ended gradually from 1957; in November 1960 the last men entered service.\nWith British youth no longer subject to military service and with postwar rationing and reconstruction ended, the stage was set for the social uprisings of the 1960s to commence.\n\nMacmillan took close control of foreign policy. He worked to narrow the post-Suez rift with the US, where his wartime friendship with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was useful, and the two had a pleasant conference in Bermuda as early as March 1957.<ref>Nigel J.

In terms of the Empire, Macmillan continued [[Decolonization#Decolonization after 1945|decolonisation]], his [[Wind of Change speech]] in February 1960 indicating his policy. [[Ghana]] and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] were granted independence in 1957, [[Nigeria]] in 1960 and [[Kenya]] in 1963.  However, in the Middle East Macmillan ensured Britain remained a force \u2014 intervening over [[Iraq]] in 1958 ([[14 July Revolution]]) and 1960<!---what happened ??---> and becoming involved in [[Oman]]. Immigrants from the Commonwealth flocked to England after The British Government posted invitations in the [[British West Indies]], for Workers to come to England to \"help the mother Country\".\n\nHe led the Tories to victory in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|October 1959 general election]], increasing his party's majority from 67 to 107 seats.\n\nFollowing the technical failures of a British independent nuclear deterrent with the [[Blue Streak missile|Blue Streak]] and the [[Blue Steel missile|Blue Steel]] projects, Macmillan negotiated the supply of American [[Polaris missile]]s under the [[Nassau agreement]] in December 1962.  Previously he had agreed to base sixty [[Thor missile]]s in Britain under joint control, and since late 1957 the American [[McMahon Act]] had been eased to allow Britain more access to nuclear technology. Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union signed the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] in autumn 1963. Britain's application to join the Common Market was vetoed by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 29 January 1963, in due to his fear that 'the end would be a colossal Atlantic Community dependent on America', and personal anger at the Anglo-American nuclear deal.<ref>Peter Mangold, ''Almost Impossible Ally: Harold Macmillan & Charles de Gaulle'' (2006).</ref>\n\nBritain's [[balance of payments]] problems led to the imposition of a seven-month [[wage freeze]] in 1961.<ref name=\"papers\">http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/strained-consensus-labour.htm Cabinet Papers - Strained consensus and Labour]</ref>   This caused the government to lose popularity and led to a series of [[by-election]] defeats. He organised [[Conservative Government 1957\u201364#July 1962 \u2013 October 1963|a major Cabinet change in July 1962]] but he continued to lose support from within his party.\n\nHe [[Harold Macmillan#Resignation|resigned on 18 October 1963]] after he had been admitted to hospital for [[prostate]] trouble. He died 23 years later, in 1986.\n\n===Alec Douglas-Home (1963\u201364)===\n[[File:Alec_Douglas-Home_(c1963).jpg|thumb|[[Alec Douglas-Home]]]]\n\nMacmillan's successor was the [[Earl of Home]], [[Alec Douglas-Home]]. However, as no prime minister had led from the House of Lords since the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] in 1902, Home chose to become a member of parliament so he could enter the House of Commons. He disclaimed his earldom and, as \"Sir Alec Douglas-Home\", contested a [[by-election]] in the safe seat of [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross & West Perthshire]]. He won and is the only prime minister to resign the Lords to enter the Commons.  His demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned, however. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor [[Reginald Maudling]] [[Rein|free rein]] to handle financial affairs. Home's few domestic policies were not well received, but he did abolish retail price maintenance, which allowed consumers to find more bargains on sale.  He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister [[Rab Butler]] was not especially energetic.  Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by de Gaulle, the Cuban missile crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again on the back burner. Decolonization issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.<ref>Andrew Holt, ''The Foreign Policy of the Douglas-Home Government: Britain, the United States and the End of Empire'' (Springer, 2014).</ref>\n\nIn the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], the Labour Party was returned to power under [[Harold Wilson]]. Douglas-Home became Leader of the Opposition. In July 1965, [[Edward Heath]] defeated Reginald Maudling and [[Enoch Powell]] to succeed him as Conservative Party leader. Enoch Powell was given the post of Shadow Defence Secretary and became a figure of national prominence when he made the controversial [[Rivers of Blood speech]] in 1968, warning on the dangers of mass [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|immigration from Commonwealth nations]]. It is possible that the Conservatives' success in the 1970 general election was a result of the large public following Powell attained, even as he was sacked from the shadow cabinet.\n\n===Thirteen Wasted Years?===\n\"Thirteen Wasted Years!\" was a popular slogan attacking the Conservative record 1951-1964. Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative Party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education. It is unrealistic to expect that Britain could have continued as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.<ref>Graham Goodlad,  \"Thirteen Wasted Years: \"Do the Conservative governments of  1951-64 deserve this label\" ''Modern History Review''  (2001) 13#2 pp 2-5.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Clements|title=My Revision Notes: AQA AS/A-level History: The Making of Modern Britain, 1951-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDMaDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT13|year=2017|publisher=Hodder Education|page=13|isbn=9781471876295}}</ref>\n\n==Labour Government, 1964\u201370==\n{{Further|First Wilson ministry}}\n[[File:Harold Wilson (1967).jpg|thumb|[[Harold Wilson]]]]\n\n===Harold Wilson===\nIn 1964, Labour regained the premiership, as [[Harold Wilson]] narrowly won the general election with a majority of five. This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after a short period of competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As Prime Minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast had seemed to present it as a triumph.\n\n====Open University====\nWilson regarded with special pride setting up  the [[Open University]] as a model for Europe. Plans were  drafted by Jennie Lee, the Minister for the Arts; she had Wilson's full support.  He saw the Open University as a major marker of the Labour Party's commitment to modernisation. He emphasized that it would strengthen a more competitive economy while also fostering greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. He especially favoured heavy use of technology, such as television and radio broadcast of its courses.  There were strong doubters and opponents in the  government and in commercial broadcasting; Wilson outmaneuvered them to get the budget approved, even though its sums proved far too small.<ref>Pete Dorey,  \"\u2018Well, Harold Insists on Having It!\u2019\u2014The Political Struggle to Establish The Open University, 1965\u201367.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 29.2 (2015): 241-272.</ref>\n\n====Vietnam War ====\nOverseas, Wilson was troubled by crises in  [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]]. The Vietnam War was a delicate issue, as President Lyndon Johnson urgently needed a symbolic British military presence. \"Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam,\" Wilson told his Cabinet in December 1964. Labour decided not to antagonize its strong antiwar element and refused Johnson's pleas.<ref>Sylvia A. Ellis, \"Promoting solidarity at home and abroad: the goals and tactics of the anti-Vietnam War movement in Britain.\" ''European Review of History: Revue europ\u00e9enne d\u2019histoire 21.4'' (2014): 557-576.</ref> However, Wilson provided the Americans with intelligence, military weapons, and jungle training, and allowed some 2000 British soldiers to volunteer for service in Vietnam.<ref>Marc Tiley, \"Britain, Vietnam and the Special Relationship,\" ''History Today'' 63#12 (2013) pp  1-4.</ref>\n\n====Industrial strike====\n{{See also|In Place of Strife}}\nIn addition to the damage done to its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the [[National Union of Seamen]], which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's own sense of insecurity in office.\n\n==Conservative Government, 1970\u201374==\n{{Further|Heath ministry}}\n[[File:Heathdod.JPG|thumb|[[Edward Heath]]]]\n\n===Edward Heath===\nThe premiership of his successor, [[Edward Heath|Sir Edward Heath]] was the bloodiest in the history of the [[Northern Ireland]] [[Troubles]]. He was prime minister at the time of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1972 when 14 unarmed men were killed by British soldiers during a banned [[civil rights]] march in [[Derry]]. In 2003, he gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and claimed that he never promoted or agreed to the use of unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland. In July 1972, he permitted his [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[William Whitelaw]] to hold unofficial talks in London with a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] delegation by [[Se\u00e1n Mac Stiof\u00e1in]]. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties. In 1974, the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] was produced but fiercely repudiated by many Unionists and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] ceased to support the Conservatives at Westminster.\n\nHeath took Britain into the [[EEC]] (later renamed The European Union) on 1 January 1973 after winning the decisive vote in the House by 336-244. It was, says biographer John Campbell, \"Heath's finest hour.\"<ref>John Campbell, ''Edward Heath'' (1993) p 404-5.</ref> Meanwhile, on the domestic front, galloping inflation led him into confrontation with some of the most powerful trade unions. Energy shortages related to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock]] resulted in much of the country's industry working a [[Three-Day Week]] to conserve power. In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives. Heath began negotiations with leaders of the Liberal Party to form a coalition, but, when these failed, resigned as Prime Minister.\n\n==Labour Government, 1974\u201379==\n{{Main|Labour government 1974\u201379}}\n\n===Harold Wilson (1974\u201376)===\nHeath was replaced by Harold Wilson, who returned on 4 March 1974 to form a minority government. Wilson was confirmed in office, with a three-seat majority, in a [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|second election in October of the same year]].<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Wilson: The Authorised Life'' (1993).</ref>  It was a manifesto pledge in the general election of February 1974 for a Labour government to re-negotiate better terms for Britain in the EEC, and then hold a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC on the new terms. After the House of Commons voted in favour of retaining the Common Market on the renegotiated terms, a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] was held on 5 June 1975. A majority were in favour of retaining the Common Market.<ref>Roy Pierce, Henry Valen, and Ola Listhaug. \"Referendum voting behaviour: The Norwegian and British referenda on membership in the European Community.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' (1983): 43-63. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111052 in JSTOR]</ref>  But Wilson was not able to end the economic crisis. Unemployment remained well in excess of 1,000,000, inflation peaked at 24% in 1975, and the national debt was increasing. The rise of punk rock bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]] were a reflection of the discontent felt by British youth during the difficulties of the late 1970s.\n\n===James Callaghan (1976\u201379)===\n[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Callaghan]]]]\nWilson announced his surprise resignation on 16 March 1976 and unofficially endorsed his Foreign Secretary [[James Callaghan]] as his successor. His broad popularity in many parts of the Labour movement saw him through [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|three ballots]] of Labour MPs, defeating the arch-Bevanite [[Michael Foot]], the main left-wing candidate. Callaghan was the first Prime Minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions \u2014 Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary \u2014 prior to becoming Prime Minister.<ref>[[Kenneth O. Morgan]], ''Callaghan: A Life'' (Oxford UP, 1997).</ref>\n\nCallaghan's support for and from the union movement should not be mistaken for a left wing position. Callaghan continued Wilson's policy of a balanced Cabinet and relied heavily on Michael Foot. Foot was made [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and given the task of steering through the government's legislative programme.\n\nCallaghan's time as Prime Minister was dominated by the troubles in running a Government with a minority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]; by-election defeats had wiped out Labour's three-seat majority by early 1977. Callaghan was forced to make deals with minor parties in order to survive, including the [[Lib-Lab pact]]. He had been forced to accept referendums on devolution in Scotland and Wales (the first went in favour but did not reach the required majority, and the second went heavily against).\n\nHowever, by the autumn of 1978 the economy was showing signs of recovery \u2013 although unemployment now stood at 1,500,000, economic growth was strong and inflation had fallen below 10%.<ref>biz/ed{{clarify|date=February 2018}}</ref> Most opinion polls were showing Labour ahead and he was expected to call an election before the end of the year. His decision not to has been described as the biggest mistake of his premiership.\n\nCallaghan's way of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success. He gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in 1979, and so attempted to hold pay rises to 5% or less. The Trade Unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]) secured higher pay, although it had virtually paralysed the country, tarnished Britain's political reputation and seen the Conservatives surge ahead in the opinion polls.<ref>John Shepherd, ''Crisis? What Crisis?: The Callaghan Government and the British 'winter of Discontent'. '' (Manchester University Press, 2013).</ref><ref>Colin Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\" ''The Political Quarterly'' 80.4 (2009): 545\u2013552.</ref>\n\nHe was forced to call an election when the House of Commons passed a [[Motion of No Confidence]] by one vote on 28 March 1979. The Conservatives, with advertising consultants [[Saatchi and Saatchi]], ran a campaign on the slogan \"Labour isn't working.\" As expected, [[Margaret Thatcher]] (who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in [[1975 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|February 1975]]) won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] held on 3 May, becoming Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nHistorian [[Kenneth O.

Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of Empire, and wanted the country to punch above its weight in international affairs. She was a philosophic soulmate with [[Ronald Reagan]], elected in 1980 in the United States, and to a lesser extent, [[Brian Mulroney]], who was elected in 1984 in Canada. It seemed for a time that conservatism might be the dominant political philosophy in the major English-speaking nations for the era.\n\n====Irish issues====\n{{See also|Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1980\u201389)}}\nNorthern Ireland was in a violent phase.<ref>Frank Gaffikin, ''Northern Ireland: The Thatcher Years'' (1989).</ref> Insurgents planted bombs and assassinated its foes, including in 1979 [[Airey Neave]], Thatcher's close friend who was slated to take charge there.

This meant relieving the burden on the mainstream [[British army]] and elevating the role of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=William J.

P. J. McLoughlin finds the consensus of scholars is that it was a significant factor contributing to the development of the Northern Ireland peace process.<ref>P. J. McLoughlin, \"\u2018The First Major Step in the Peace Process\u2019? Exploring the Impact of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on Irish Republican Thinking.\" ''Irish Political Studies'' 29.1 (2014): 116-133.</ref>   However, the agreement was greeted with fury by Irish unionists. The [[Ulster Unionists]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]] made an electoral pact and on 23 January 1986, staged an ad-hoc referendum by re-fighting their seats in by-elections, and won with one seat lost to the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP). Then, unlike the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974, they found they could not bring the agreement down by a general strike. This was another effect of the changed balance of power in industrial relations. The Hillsborough agreement stood, and Thatcher punished the unionists for their non-cooperation by abolishing the devolved assembly she had created only four years before.<ref>{{cite book|author=Feargal Cochrane|title=Unionist Politics and the Politics of Unionism Since the Anglo-Irish Agreement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnAyhBCnpLQC&pg=PA16|year=1997|publisher=Cork UP|page=16|isbn=9781859181386}}</ref>\n\n====Economics====\nIn economic policy, Thatcher and her Chancellor Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] started out with policies, including higher interest rates, to [[Monetarism|drive down the rate of growth of the money supply]]. She had a preference for indirect taxation over taxes on income: in 1979 [[Exchange Control|exchange controls]] were abolished and the top rate of income tax on \"unearned\" income cut from 98% to 60%, but [[value added tax]] (VAT) was increased sharply to 15% with the result that inflation also rose. These moves hit businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, and [[unemployment]] \u2013 which had stood at 1,500,000 by the time of the 1979 general election \u2013 was above 2,000,000 by the end of 1980. It continued to rise throughout 1981, passing the 2,500,000 mark during the summer of that year \u2013 although inflation was now down to 12% compared to 27% two years earlier. The economy was now in [[Early 1980s recession|recession]].\n\nHer early tax policy reforms were based on the monetarist theories of [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]] rather than the [[supply-side economics]] of [[Art Laffer|Arthur Laffer]] and [[Jude Wanniski]], which the government of [[Ronald Reagan]] espoused. There was a severe recession in the early 1980s, and the Government's economic policy was widely blamed. In January 1982, the inflation rate dropped to single figures and interest rates fell. Unemployment peaked at 3.1 million and remained at that level until 1986.<ref>See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm \"1982: UK unemployment tops three million\" ''BBC: On This Day'']</ref>  The recession of the early 1980s was the deepest in Britain since the depression of the 1930s and Thatcher's popularity plummeted; most predictions had her losing the next election.\n\n====Falklands War====\n{{Main|Falklands War}}\n[[File:ARA General Belgrano underway.jpg|thumb|The British sank the Argentine cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano]] during the Falklands War.]]\n\nIn Argentina, an unstable military junta was in power and keen on reversing its huge economic unpopularity. On 2 April 1982, it invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], the only invasion of a British territory since World War II. [[History of the Falkland Islands|Argentina has claimed]] the islands since an 1830s dispute on their settlement. Thatcher sent a naval task force to recapture the Islands. The ensuing [[Falklands War]] saw the swift defeat of Argentina in only a few days of fighting, resulting in a wave of patriotic enthusiasm for Thatcher personally, at a time when her popularity had been at an all-time low for a serving Prime Minister. Opinion polls showed a huge surge in Conservative support which would be sufficient to win a general election. In the end, the war probably raised the Conservative vote by about six points, according to scholarly studies of the polling data.<ref>Helmut Norpoth,  \"The Falklands war and government popularity in Britain: Rally without consequence or surge without decline?.\" ''Electoral Studies'' 6.1 (1987): 3-16.</ref><ref>Harold D.

Thatcher negotiated directly in September 1982 with that country's leader [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>Chi-kwan Mark, \"To \u2018educate\u2019 Deng Xiaoping in capitalism: Thatcher\u2019s visit to China and the future of Hong Kong in 1982.\" ''Cold War History'' (2015): 1-20.</ref>  They agreed on the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration|Sino-British Joint Declaration over the Question of Hong Kong]] which provided for a peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to Beijing's control in 15 years' time, after which the city would be allowed to retain its \"capitalistic\" system for another 50 years.\n\nThatcher's strong opposition against communism as represented by the Soviet Union as well as the decisive military victory against Argentina, re-affirmed Britain's influential position on the world stage and bolstered Thatcher's firm leadership. In addition the economy was showing positive signs of recovery thanks mainly to substantial oil revenues from the [[North Sea]].<ref>James T. H. Tang,  \"From empire defence to imperial retreat: Britain's postwar China policy and the decolonization of Hong Kong.\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 28.02 (1994): 317-337.</ref>\n\n====Nuclear disarmament====\nThe 1983 election was also influenced by events in the opposition parties. Since their 1979 defeat, Labour was increasingly dominated by its \"[[hard left]]\" that had emerged from the 1970s union militancy, and in opposition its policies had swung very sharply to the left while the Conservatives had drifted further to the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. This drove a significant number of right wing Labour members and MPs to form a breakaway party in 1981, the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. Labour fought the election on [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|unilateral nuclear disarmament]], which proposed to abandon the British nuclear deterrent despite the threat from a nuclear armed Soviet Union, withdrawal from the [[European Community]], and total reversal of Thatcher's economic and trade union changes. Indeed, one Labour MP, [[Gerald Kaufman]], has called the party's 1983 manifesto \"the longest suicide note in history\". Consequently, upon the Labour split, there was a new centrist challenge, the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|Alliance]], from the Social Democrats in electoral pact with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], to break the major parties' dominance and win [[proportional representation]]. The British Electoral Study found that Alliance voters were preferentially tilted towards the Conservatives [https://web.archive.org/web/20071108021324/http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/voting/av_apend1.html], but this possible loss of vote share by the Conservatives was more than compensated for by the [[first past the post]] electoral system, where marginal changes in vote numbers and distribution have disproportionate effects on the number of seats won.  Accordingly, despite the Alliance vote share coming very close to that of Labour and preventing an absolute majority in votes for the Conservatives, the Alliance failed to break into Parliament in significant numbers and the Conservatives were returned in a landslide.\n\n====Trade union power====\nThatcher was committed to reducing the power of the [[trade union]]s but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched [[strike action|strike]]s that were wholly or partly aimed at damaging her politically.  The most significant of these was carried out by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM). However, Thatcher had made preparations long in advance for an NUM strike by building up coal stocks, and there were no cuts in electric power, unlike 1972. Police tactics during the strike concerned civil libertarians: stopping suspected strike sympathisers travelling towards coalfields when they were still long distances from them, phone tapping as evidenced by Labour's [[Tony Benn]], and a violent battle with mass pickets at Orgreave, Yorkshire. But images of massed militant miners using violence to prevent other miners from working, along with the fact that (illegally under a recent Act) the NUM had not held a national ballot to approve strike action. Scargill's policy of letting each region of the NUM call its own strike backfired when nine areas held ballots that resulted in majority votes against striking,<ref>[http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2008/11/04/great-miners-strike-1984-5-twelve-months-shook-britain-story-strike The Great Miners Strike 1984-5: Twelve Months that Shook Britain: the Story of the Strike, Workers' Liberty, written by Sean Matgamna and Martin Thomas, 4 November 2008]</ref> and violence against strikebreakers escalated with time until reaching a tipping point with the [[killing of David Wilkie]] (a taxi-driver who was taking a strikebreaker to work). The [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] lasted a full year, March 1984 until March 1985, before the drift of half the miners back to work forced the NUM leadership to give in without a deal. Thatcher had won a decisive victory and the unions never recovered their political power. This aborted political strike marked a turning point in UK politics: no longer could militant unions remove a democratically elected government. It also marked to beginning of a new economic and political culture in the UK based upon small government intervention in the economy and reduced dominance of the trade unions and welfare state.\n\n====Thatcher's political and economic philosophy====\n{{Further|Thatcherism}}\nThatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised [[free market]]s and entrepreneurialism. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small nationalised company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly large response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and sold off many of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of [[privatisation]], while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with Thatcherism.\n\n[[File:President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Camp David 1986.jpg|thumb|upright|Thatcher with President Ronald Reagan, 1986.]]\nIn the Cold War, Thatcher supported [[Reagan Doctrine|Ronald Reagan's policies]] of [[Rollback]] with the goal of reducing or ending Soviet Communist power.<ref>Sally-Ann Treharne, ''Reagan and Thatcher's Special Relationship'' (Edinburgh UP, 2015).</ref>  This contrasted with the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]] which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies still wedded to the idea of d\u00e9tente. US forces were permitted by Mrs. Thatcher to station nuclear [[cruise missile]]s at British bases, arousing mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], declaring she liked him and \"We can do business together\" after a meeting three months before he came to power in 1985. This was a start in swinging the West back to a new d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union in his era, as it proved to be an indication that the Soviet regime's power was decaying. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and voices who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and d\u00e9tente postures.\n\nShe supported the US bombing raid on [[Libya]] from bases in the UK in 1986 when other NATO allies would not. Her liking for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the [[Westland affair]] when she acted with colleagues to prevent the helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Aircraft|Westland]], a vital defence contractor, from linking with a European Consortium including the Italian firm [[Agusta]] in favour of a link with [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] of the United States. Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]], who had pushed the European Consortium, resigned in protest at her style of leadership, and thereafter became a potential leadership challenger. Trade and Industry Secretary [[Leon Brittan]] then had to resign for having ordered the leak of a confidential legal letter critical of Heseltine; Thatcher survived the crisis as her personal involvement in the leak was not proven.\n\nBy winning the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], on the economic boom (with unemployment finally falling below 3,000,000 that spring) and against a stubbornly anti-nuclear Labour opposition (now led by [[Neil Kinnock]] after [[Michael Foot|Michael Foot's]] resignation four years earlier), she became the longest serving [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] since the 1820s. Most newspapers supported her \u2014 with the exception of ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' \u2014 and were rewarded with regular press briefings by her press secretary, [[Bernard Ingham]].\n\nShe was known as \"Maggie\" in the popular tabloids, which inspired the well-known [[Maggie Out protest song|\"Maggie Out!\" protest song]], sung throughout that period by some of her opponents. Her unpopularity on the left is evident from the lyrics of several contemporary popular songs: \"Stand Down Margaret\" ([[The Beat (British band)|The Beat]]), \"Tramp the Dirt Down\" ([[Elvis Costello]]), \"Mother Knows Best\" ([[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]), and \"Margaret on the Guillotine\" ([[Morrissey]]).<ref>Matthew Worley, \"Shot by both sides: punk, politics and the end of \u2018consensus\u2019.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 26.3 (2012): 333-354.</ref>\n\nMany opponents believed she and her policies created a significant North-South divide from the [[Bristol Channel]] to [[The Wash]], between the \"haves\" in the economically dynamic south and the \"have nots\" in the northern rust belt.  Hard welfare reforms in her third term created an adult Employment Training system that included full-time work done for the dole plus a \u00a310 top-up, on the [[workfare]] model from the US. The \"Social Fund\" system that placed one-off welfare payments for emergency needs under a local budgetary limit, and where possible changed them into loans, and rules for assessing jobseeking effort by the week, were breaches of social consensus unprecedented since the 1920s.\n\nThe sharp fall in unemployment continued. By the end of 1987, it stood at just over 2,600,000 \u2013 having started the year still in excess of 3,000,000. It stood at just over 2,000,000 by the end of 1988, and by the end of 1989 less than 1,700,000 were unemployed. However, total economic growth for 1989 stood at 2% \u2013 the lowest since 1982 \u2013 signalling an end to the economic boom. Several other countries had now entered recession, and fears were now rife that Britain was also on the verge of another recession.<ref name=autogenerated1>Biz/ed{{clarify|date=February 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Thatcher, a trained chemist, became concerned with environmental issues, putting on the national agenda such technical issues as  [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[acid rain]].   In 1990, she opened the [[Hadley Centre]] for climate prediction and research.<ref>Jon Agar,  \"\u2018Future Forecast\u2014Changeable and Probably Getting Worse\u2019: The UK Government\u2019s Early Response to Anthropogenic Climate Change.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 26.4 (2015): 602-628; Andrew Blowers, \"Transition or Transformation?\u2010Environmental Policy Under Thatcher.\" ''Public Administration'' 65.3 (1987): 277-294.\n</ref>\n\nIn September 1988, at [[Bruges, Belgium|Bruges]], Thatcher announced her opposition to proposals from the [[European Community]] for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making. Although she had supported British membership, Thatcher believed that the role of the EC should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that new EC regulations would reverse the changes she was making in the UK. \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a new super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\". The speech caused an outcry from other European leaders, and exposed for the first time the deep split that was emerging over European policy inside her Conservative Party. Since 1985 Thatcher had been blocking British membership of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM), a preparation for [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]], through which a single currency would replace national currencies, which the EC began seriously to discuss by 1990.\n\nThatcher's popularity once again declined in 1989 as the economy suffered from high interest rates imposed to stop an unsustainable [[Boom and bust|boom]]. She blamed her Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], who had exacerbated the boom by trying to keep the pound sterling low (\"shadowing the Deutschmark\") as a preparation for ERM membership; Thatcher claimed not to have been told of this and did not approve. At the [[Madrid]] European summit, Lawson and Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] forced Thatcher to agree the circumstances under which she would join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Thatcher took revenge on both by demoting Howe, and by listening more to her adviser Sir [[Alan Walters]] on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.\n\nThat November, Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by Sir [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Meyer]]. As Meyer was a virtually unknown [[backbencher|backbench]] MP, he was viewed as a [[stalking horse]] candidate for more prominent members of the party.  Thatcher easily defeated Meyer's challenge, but there were 60 ballot papers either cast for Meyer or abstaining, a surprisingly large number for a sitting Prime Minister.\n\nThatcher's new system to replace local government rates was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales in 1990. Rates were replaced by the \"Community Charge\" (more widely known as the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]), which applied the same amount to every individual resident, with only limited discounts for low earners. This was to be the most universally unpopular policy of her premiership, and saw the Conservative government split further behind the Labour opposition (still led by Neil Kinnock) in the opinion polls. The Charge was introduced early in Scotland as the rateable values would in any case have been reassessed in 1989. However, it led to accusations that Scotland was a 'testing ground' for the tax. Thatcher apparently believed that the new tax would be popular, and had been persuaded by Scottish Conservatives to bring it in early and in one go. Despite her hopes, the early introduction led to a sharp decline in the already low support for the Conservative party in Scotland.\n\nAdditional problems emerged when many of the tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions.  Some have argued that local councils saw the introduction of the new system of taxation as the opportunity to make significant increases in the amount taken, assuming (correctly) that it would be the originators of the new tax system and not its local operators who would be blamed.\n\nA large London demonstration against the poll tax in [[Trafalgar Square]] on 31 March 1990 \u2014 the day before it was introduced in England and Wales \u2014 turned into a [[Poll tax riots|riot]]. Millions of people resisted paying the tax. Opponents of the tax banded together to resist [[bailiff]]s and disrupt court hearings of poll tax debtors. Mrs Thatcher refused to compromise, or change the tax, and its unpopularity was a major factor in Thatcher's downfall.\n\nBy the autumn of 1990, opposition to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (especially high interest rates of 15%, which were undermining her core voting base within the home-owning, entrepreneurial and business sectors), and the divisions opening within her party over the appropriate handling of [[European integration]] made Thatcher and her party seem increasingly politically vulnerable. Her increasingly combative, irritable personality also made opposition to her grow fast and by this point, even many in her own party could not stand her.\n\n===John Major (1990\u201397)===\n{{Further|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|[[John Major]]]]\nIn November 1990, [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party. Thatcher fell short of the required 15% majority in the first round and was persuaded to withdraw from the second round on 22 November, ending her 11-year premiership. Her Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Major]] contested the second round and defeated Michael Heseltine as well as Foreign Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], becoming prime minister on 27 November 1990.<ref>Philip Cowley and John Garry, \"The British conservative party and Europe: the choosing of John major.\" ''British Journal of Political Science'' 28#3 (1998): 473-499, on how Major won.</ref>\n\nBy this stage, however, Britain had slid into [[Early 1990s|recession]] for the third time in less than 20 years. Unemployment had started to rise in the spring of 1990 but by the end of the year it was still lower than in many other European economies, particularly France and Italy.\n\n[[File:British gulf war.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British troops in the Gulf]]\nJohn Major was Prime Minister during British involvement in the [[Gulf War]]. Polls improved for the Conservatives despite the recession deepening throughout 1991 and into 1992, with the economy for 1991 falling 2% and unemployment passing the 2,000,000 mark.<ref>Dennis Kavanagh and Anthony Seldon, eds., ''The Major Effect: An Overview of John Major's Premiership'' (1994)</ref>  Major called a [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for April 1992 and took his campaign onto the streets, famously delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox as in his Lambeth days. This populist \"common touch\", in contrast to the Labour Party's more slick campaign, chimed with the electorate and Major won, albeit with a small parliamentary majority.<ref>Peter Dorey, ''The Major Premiership: Politics and Policies under John Major, 1990\u201397'' (1999)</ref>\n\nThe narrow majority for the Conservative government proved to be unmanageable, particularly after the United Kingdom's forced exit from the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] on [[Black Wednesday]] (16 September 1992) just five months into the new parliament. From this stage onwards, Labour \u2013 now led by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] \u2013 was ascendant in the opinion polls. Major allowed his economic team to stay in place unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before forcing the resignation of his Chancellor, [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], whom he replaced with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This delay was seen as indicative of one of his weaknesses, an indecisiveness towards personnel issues that was to undermine his authority through the rest of his premiership.<ref name=\"Dorey, 1999\">Dorey, ''The Major Premiership: Politics and Policies under John Major, 1990\u201397'' (1999)</ref>\n\nAt the 1993 Conservative Party Conference, Major began his ill-fated  \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to be about the economy, education, policing, and other such issues, but it was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) as an attempt to revert to the moral and family values that the Conservative Party were often associated with. A number of sleaze scandals involving Conservative MP's were exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail in tabloid newspapers following this and further reduced the Conservative's popularity. Despite Major's best efforts, the Conservative Party collapsed into political infighting. Major took a moderate approach but found himself undermined by the right-wing within the party and the Cabinet.\n\nMajor's policy towards the [[European Union]] aroused opposition as the Government attempted to ratify the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Although the Labour opposition supported the treaty, they were prepared to undertake tactical moves to weaken the government, which included passing an amendment that required a vote on the social chapter aspects of the treaty before it could be ratified. Several Conservative MPs (the [[Maastricht Rebels]]) voted against the Government and the vote was lost. Major hit back by calling another vote on the following day (23 July 1993), which he declared a [[vote of confidence]]. He won by 40 but had damaged his authority.<ref name=\"Dorey, 1999\"/>\n\nOne of the few bright spots of 1993 for the Conservative government came in April when the end of the recession was finally declared after nearly three years.  Unemployment had touched 3,000,000 by the turn of the year, but had dipped to 2,800,000 by Christmas as the economic recovery continued.   The economic recovery was strong and sustained throughout 1994, with unemployment falling below 2,500,000 by the end of the year.

A few residual responsibilities of the BRB remained with [[BRB (Residuary) Ltd.]]\n\nFew were surprised when Major lost the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] to [[Tony Blair]], though the immense scale of the defeat was not widely predicted. In the new parliament Labour won 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, leaving the Labour party with a majority of 179 which was the biggest majority since [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]]. In addition, the Conservatives lost all their seats in Scotland and Wales and several cabinet ministers including [[Michael Portillo]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Ian Lang]] lost their seats, as did former cabinet minister [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]].

Under the title of ''[[New Labour]]'', he promised economic and social reform and brought Labour closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] of the political spectrum. Early policies of the Blair government included the [[minimum wage]] and the introduction of university [[tuition fees]]. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] also gave the [[Bank of England]] the power to set the base rate of interest autonomously. The traditional tendency of governments to manipulate interest rates around the time of general elections for political gain is thought to have been deleterious to the UK economy and helped reinforce a cyclical pattern of [[boom and bust]]. Brown's decision was popular with [[City of London|the City]], which the Labour Party had been courting since the early 1990s. Blair presided over the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century and his premiership saw large investment into social aspects, in particular health and education, areas particularly under-invested during the Conservative government of the 1980s and early 1990s. The [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] was introduced in 1998 and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] came into force in 2000. Most hereditary peers were removed from the [[House of Lords]] in 1999 and the [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|Civil Partnership Act]] of 2005 allowed [[homosexual]] couples the right to register their partnership with the same rights and responsibilities comparable to heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe nation was stunned when Princess Diana [[death of Princess Diana|died in a car accident in Paris]] on 31 August 1997, even though she had divorced Prince Charles a few years earlier. Numerous conspiracy theories arose about her being assassinated due to her plans to marry an Muslim businessman, although nothing was ever proven.\n\nFrom the beginning, New Labour's record on the economy and unemployment was strong, suggesting that they could break with the trend of Labour governments overseeing an economic decline while in power. They had inherited an unemployment count of 1,700,000 from the Conservatives, and by the following year unemployment was down to 1,300,000 \u2013 a level not seen since [[James Callaghan]] was in power some 20 years previously. A minimum wage was announced in May 1998, coming into force from April 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/chron/kf1998.htm |title=Key Facts on 1998 |publisher=Biz/ed |date=26 May 1999 |accessdate=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929212354/http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/chron/kf1998.htm |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Unemployment would remain similarly low for the next 10 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10604117 | publisher=BBC News | title=Economy tracker | date=19 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TonyBlairArmagh1998.jpg|thumb|left|Blair addresses Armagh in 1998]]\nThe long-running [[Northern Ireland peace process]] was brought to a conclusion in 1998 with the [[Belfast Agreement]] which established a devolved [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and de-escalated the violence associated with [[the Troubles]]. It was signed in April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and was endorsed by all the main political parties in Northern Ireland with the exception of [[Ian Paisley]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. Voters in Northern Ireland approved the agreement in a referendum in May 1998 and it came into force in December 1999. In August 1998, a car-bomb [[Omagh bombing|exploded]] in the Northern Ireland town of [[Omagh]], killing 29 people and injuring 220. The attack was carried out by the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] who opposed the Belfast Agreement. It was reported in 2005, that the IRA had renounced violence and had ditched its entire arsenal.\n\nIn foreign policy, following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, Blair greatly supported [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s new [[War on Terror]] which began with the forced withdrawal of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]]. Blair's case for the subsequent war in Iraq was based on their alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's weapons of mass destruction]]. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that \"the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so\". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the \"[[Iraq Dossier|Dodgy Dossier]]\".\n\n[[File:Operation Sond Chara 02.jpg|thumb|British troops in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghan War]].]]\n46,000 British troops, one-third of the total strength of the [[British Army]] (land forces), were deployed to assist with the invasion of Iraq. When after the war, no WMDs were found in Iraq, the two dossiers, together with Blair's other pre-war statements, became an issue of considerable controversy. Many Labour Party members, including a number who had supported the war, were among the critics. Successive independent inquiries (including those by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons, the senior judge Lord Hutton, and the former senior civil servant Lord Butler of Brockwell) have found that Blair honestly stated what he believed to be true at the time, though Lord Butler's report did imply that the Government's presentation of the intelligence evidence had been subject to some degree of exaggeration. These findings have not prevented frequent accusations that Blair was deliberately deceitful, and, during the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election campaign]], Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] made political capital out of the issue. The new threat of international terrorism ultimately led to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005 bomb attacks]] in London which killed 52 people as well as the four suicide bombers who led the attack.\n\nThe Labour government was re-elected with a second successive landslide in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|general election]] of June 2001.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}</ref> Blair became the first Labour leader to lead the party to three successive election victories when they won the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], though this time he had a drastically reduced majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519863.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Blair secures historic third term | date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives had so far failed to represent a serious challenge to Labour's rule, with John Major's successor William Hague unable to make any real improvement upon the disastrous 1997 general election result at the next election four years later. He stepped down after the 2001 election to be succeeded by [[Iain Duncan Smith]], who did not even hold the leadership long enough to contest a general election \u2013 being ousted by his own MP's in October 2003<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3225127.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Tory leader ousted | date=29 October 2003}}</ref> and being replaced by [[Michael Howard]], who had served as [[Home Secretary]] in the government of John Major. Howard failed to win the 2005 general election for the Conservatives but he at least had the satisfaction of narrowing the Labour majority, giving his successor (he announced his resignation shortly after the election) a decent platform to build upon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3245561.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Howard crowned Tory leader | date=6 November 2003}}</ref> However, the Conservatives began to re-emerge as an electable prospect following the election of [[David Cameron]] as Howard's successor in December 2005. Within months of Cameron becoming Conservative leader, opinion polls during 2006 were showing a regular Conservative lead for the first time since Black Wednesday 14 years earlier. Despite the economy still being strong and unemployment remaining low, Labour's decline in support was largely blamed upon poor control of immigration and allowing Britain to become what was seen by many as an easy target for terrorists.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/22/uk.topstories3 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Julian | last=Glover | title=Tories open nine-point lead as Labour drops to 19-year low | date=22 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Devolution for Scotland and Wales====\nBlair also came into power with a policy of [[devolution]]. A pre-legislative [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum]] was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions:  whether to create a devolved [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] for Scotland and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. Following a clear 'yes' vote on both questions, a [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum]] on the proposal for creating a devolved [[Welsh Assembly|Assembly]] was held two weeks later. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. The [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first election to the Scottish parliament]] saw the creation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition with [[Donald Dewar]] as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]]. In Wales, the Labour Party achieved a complete majority with [[Alun Michael]] as the [[First Minister for Wales|Welsh First Minister]]. In the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish election]], the [[Scottish National Party]] gained enough seats to form a minority government with its leader [[Alex Salmond]] as First Minister.\n\nDevolution also returned to [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], leaving England as the only constituent [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country of the United Kingdom]] without a devolved administration. Within England, a devolved authority for [[London Assembly|London]] was re-established following a 'yes' vote in a London-wide referendum.\n\nOn 18 September 2014, [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|a referendum on Scottish independence]] failed with a 55/44 percentage.\n\n===Gordon Brown (2007\u201310)===\n{{Main|Premiership of Gordon Brown|Brown ministry}}\n[[File:Gordon_Brown_official.jpg|thumb|[[Gordon Brown]]]]\n\nTony Blair tendered his resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the Queen on 27 June 2007, his successor [[Gordon Brown]] assuming office the same afternoon. Brown took over as Prime Minister without having to face either a general election or a contested election for leadership of the Labour Party.\n\nBrown's style of government differed from that of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had been seen as presidential. Brown rescinded some of the policies which had either been introduced or were planned by Blair's administration. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the Iraq war, although he established an inquiry into the reasons why Britain had participated in the conflict. He proposed a \"government of all the talents\" which would involve co-opting leading personalities from industry and other professional walks of life into government positions. Brown also appointed [[Jacqui Smith]] as the UK's first female Home Secretary, while Brown's old position as Chancellor was taken over by [[Alistair Darling]].\n\nBrown was closer to American thinking, and more distant from Europe, than Blair. In major issues with foreign policy complications, He paid close attention to both the United States and the EU, especially regarding the deregulation of the Bank of England, the Welfare to Work program, and his response to the worldwide financial crisis at the G20 summit in London in 2009. Brown decided in 1997 to follow the American model and grant operational independence to set interest rates  to the [[Bank of England]], rather than have the power remain with the Treasury. He explained the Bank's monetary policy objective \"will be to deliver price stability and...to support the Government's economic policy.\"<ref>Philip Gannon,  \"Between America and Europe: Transatlantic influences on the policies of Gordon Brown.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 13.1 (2015): 1-19, quote p 5.</ref>  Brown argued for a neoliberal policy on welfare in 1997. His goal was to move people off welfare and into actual employment. He stated: \n{{quote|We cannot build a dynamic economy unless we can unleash the potential and everyone. A welfare state that thwarts the opportunities that we need to hold the economy back. A welfare state that encourages work is not only fair but makes for greater dynamism in the economy.<ref>Gannon,  \"Between America and Europe\" p 9</ref>}}\nBrown's reaction to the great 2008 banking crisis was much more pro active than France or Germany, and in many ways resembled the Bush policies in Washington. Brown's goals were to provide more liquidity to the financial system, to recapitalise the banks and to guarantee bank debt. He lowered the VAT to encourage consumer spending and to keep the economy from sinking.<ref>Gannon,  \"Between America and Europe\" p 12</ref>\n\nBrown's rise to prime minister sparked a brief surge in Labour support as the party topped most opinion polls. There was talk of a \"snap\" general election, which it was widely believed Labour could win, but Brown decided against calling an election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7031749.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Brown rules out autumn election | date=6 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nBrown's government introduced a number of fiscal policies to help keep the British economy afloat during the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial crisis]] which occurred throughout the latter part of the 2000s (decade) and early 2010, although the United Kingdom saw a dramatic increase in its national debt. Unemployment soared through 2008 as the [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] set in, and Labour standings in the opinion polls plummeted as the Conservatives became ascendant.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/2462085/Fresh-blow-for-Gordon-Brown-as-Conservatives-sweep-marginals-in-new-poll.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Hennessy | title=Fresh blow for Gordon Brown as Conservatives sweep marginals in new poll | date=26 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nSeveral major banks were nationalised after falling into financial difficulties, while large amounts of money were pumped into the economy to encourage spending. Brown was also press ganged into giving [[Gurkha]]s settlement rights in Britain by the actress and campaigner [[Joanna Lumley]] and attracted criticism for its handling of the [[Release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohamed Al Megrahi|release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi]], the only person to have been convicted over the [[Pan Am Flight 103|1988 Lockerbie bombing]].\n\nFurther European integration was introduced under the Labour governments after 1997, including the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] (1997) and the [[Treaty of Nice]] (2001). The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] (2007)introduced many further changes.  Prominent changes included more [[qualified majority voting]] in the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], increased involvement of the [[European Parliament]] in the legislative process through extended [[Codecision procedure|codecision]] with the Council of Ministers, eliminating the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar system]] established by the Maastricht Treaty of the early 1990s and the creation of a [[President of the European Council]] with a term of two and a half years and a [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] to present a united position on EU policies. The Treaty of Lisbon will also make the Union's human rights charter, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]], legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty also leads to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the [[Treaty of Lisbon#Council|Council of the European Union]] from 8.4% to 12.4%. In July 2008 the Labour government under [[Gordon Brown]] approved the treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7511281.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK ratifies the EU Lisbon Treaty|date=17 July 2008|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially, during the first four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a solid lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may be due to his handling of numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity had fallen significantly, with two contributing factors believed to be his perceived change of mind over plans to call a snap general election in October 2007, and his handling of the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and dithering. His unpopularity led eight labour MPs to call for a leadership contest in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to his perceived strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit an all-time low, and his position became increasingly under threat after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009 [[2009 United Kingdom local elections|Local]] and [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections]]. Brown's cabinet began to rebel with several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009.\n\nIn January 2010, it was revealed that Britain's economy had resumed growth after a recession which had seen a record six successive quarters of economic detraction. However, it was a narrow return to growth, and it came after the other major economies had come out of recession.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8479639.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=UK economy emerges from recession | date=27 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] \u2013 Britain's first for 36 years \u2013 with the Conservative Party controlling 306 Seats, the Labour Party 258 Seats and the Liberal Democrats 57 Seats. Brown remained as prime minister while the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] negotiated with Labour and the Conservatives to form a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 in order to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely, and on 11 May Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party. This paved the way for the Conservatives to return to power after 13 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8675265.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Cameron is new UK prime minister | date=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nHis deputy [[Harriet Harman]] became Leader of the Opposition until September 2010, when [[Ed Miliband]] was elected Leader of the Labour Party.\n\n==Coalition Government, 2010\u201315==\n{{Main|Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Premiership of David Cameron}}\n{{See also|Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition agreement}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | image1    = David Cameron - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2010.jpg\n | alt1      = David Cameron\n | caption1  = [[David Cameron]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) was Prime Minister (senior coalition partner)\n | image2    = Nick Clegg by the 2009 budget cropped.jpg\n | alt2      = Nick Clegg\n | caption2  = [[Nick Clegg]] ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) was [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] (junior coalition partner)\n}}\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the 2010 general election but did not win enough seats to win an outright majority. [[David Cameron]], who had led the party since 2005 became Prime Minister on 11 May 2010 after the Conservatives formed a [[coalition government]] with the Liberal Democrats. [[Nick Clegg]], leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and several other Liberal Democrats were given cabinet positions. Cameron promised to reduce Britain's spiralling budget deficit by cutting back on public service spending and by transferring more power to local authorities. He committed his government to Britain's continuing role in Afghanistan and stated that he hopes to remove British troops from the region by 2015. An [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget|emergency budget]] was prepared in June 2010 by Chancellor of the Exchequer [[George Osborne]] which stated that VAT will be raised to 20% and there will be a large reduction in public spending. A key Liberal Democrat policy is that of voting reform, to which a [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum]] took place in May 2011 on whether or not Britain should adopt a system of [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] to elect MPs to Westminster. However, the proposal was rejected overwhelmingly, with 68% of voters in favour of retaining first-past-the-post.  The Liberal Democrat turnabout on tuition policy at the universities alienated their younger supporters, and the continuing weakness of the economy, despite spending cutbacks, alienated the elders.\n\nIn March 2011, UK, along with France and USA voted for military intervention against Gaddafi's Libya leading to [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. Prince William married Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011 in a globally televised event much like his parents' wedding 30 years earlier. In July 2013, the royal couple welcomed their first child, Prince George. In May 2015, they welcomed their second child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. On 6 August, the [[Death of Mark Duggan]] sparked off the [[2011 England riots]].\n\nIn 2012, the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] returned to London for the first time since 1948. The United States claimed the largest count of gold medals, with Britain running third place after China.\n\nIn 2014, Scotland [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|voted in a referendum]] on the question of becoming an independent country. The No side, supported by the three major UK parties, secured a 55% to 45% majority for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Following the result on 18 September 2014, Scotland's First Minister, [[Alex Salmond]], announced his intention to step down as First Minister and leader of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]. He was replaced by his deputy, [[Nicola Sturgeon]].\n\n==Conservative Government, 2015\u2013present==\n\n===David Cameron (2015\u201316)===\n{{Main|Second Cameron ministry}}\nAfter years of austerity, the British economy was on an upswing in 2015. In line with the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] was called for 7 May 2015. The Conservatives claimed credit for the upswing, promising to keep taxes low and reduce the deficit as well as promising an In/Out referendum on the UK's relationship with the European Union. The rival Labour party called for a higher minimum wage, and higher taxes on the rich. In Scotland, the SNP attacked the austerity programme, opposed nuclear weapons and demanded that promises of more autonomy for Scotland made during the independence referendum be delivered.\n\nPre-election polls had predicted a close race and a hung parliament, but the surprising result was that a majority Conservative government was elected. The Conservatives with 37% of the popular vote held a narrow majority with 331 of the 650 seats. The other main victor was the [[Scottish National Party]] which won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. Labour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and 232 seats; they lost 40 of their 41 seats in Scotland. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] vote fell by 2/3 and they lost 49 of their 57 seats, as their coalition with the Conservatives had alienated the great majority of their supporters. The new [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), rallying voters against Europe and against immigration, did well with 13% of the vote count. It came in second in over 115 constituencies but came in first in only one.

Bryant granted filmmaker Spike Lee and 30 cameras unprecedented access to his life for one day. ''Kobe: Doin' Work'' premiered on ESPN on May 16, 2009. The documentary follows Kobe Bryant during the 2007\u201308 NBA season throughout the April 13, 2008 game against the [[San Antonio Spurs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/spike-lee-9377207|title=Spike Lee|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> \n\nThe game in which Bryant was documented and given a microphone to capture live in game moments was a heated game with the rival Spurs. Bryant shot 6 of 14 from the field, scored 20 points, and played 32 minutes. The game was a crucial game in the end of the regular season, as the Los Angeles Lakers hoped to keep first place in the Western Conference with a record of 55-25. Spike Lee was interviewed asking why he chose Kobe Bryant to direct this documentary, in which Lee replied, \"I'm a big basketball fan. It was obvious. He was having an MVP-type year, in which he did win the MVP. Also the Lakers looked like they were going to take it to the Finals. And I wanted them to beat the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]]. I hate the Celtics. But the Celtics won. But I don't think I was taking a gamble by choosing Kobe.\" (Lee, NBA.com)3. Bryant agreed to let Lee microphone him during the game, in which he also played in the game. According to Spike Lee, \"He (Kobe) said several times how much fun it was just doing it.\" (Lee, NBA.com)3. \n\nThe 83-minute documentary ran on ESPN commercial free.[3] The documentary also focuses on Bryant and the team in huddles and during time-outs. The cameras also get full access of coach [[Phil Jackson]] in the locker room with the team during half-time.[4] Bryant provided the voiceover for the documentary on February 2, 2009, hours after he scored 61 points against the [[New York Knicks]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], (then a single-game record at the arena, which has been broken since).[5] Spike Lee said that he was excited for Bryant to do the commentary following a game at Madison Square Garden, but no one expected a 61-point performance from Bryant. \"I know that if he had a terrible game the commentary would not have been the same. Guaranteed. But Kobe said he made a point to make sure not to lose the game or he would hear it from me.\" (Lee, 8th paragraph)3. Bryant indeed said in an after game interview that he was going to give the game his all in order to show Spike Lee a thing or two about Bryant's skills on the court against the Knicks. \"On a lighter note, I'm going to review this documentary I'm doing with Spike Lee tonight after the game and I didn't feel like sitting next to him and hearing him talking trash about the Knicks, so that was added incentive as well. Seriously. He's going to get an earful tonight.\" (Bryant, 8th paragraph, ESPN.com)4\n\n==Reception==\nKobe Doin\u2019 Work received mixed reviews from critics and viewers alike. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 58% viewer rating out of 100. The perception was that Bryant's in-game influence was overshadowed by highlights and pointless in-game commentary, and not enough surrounding Bryant's relentlessness on and off the court. Bryant's commentary on the documentary did receive much praise for its value to the film. Overall, the film received a decent review, but some have argued for the overuse of 30 different camera angles that were needed to capture Bryant's every move. This, according to some, distracted viewers from Bryant.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|1261843|Kobe Doin' Work}}\n*{{AllRovi movie|479477|Kobe Doin' Work}}\n\n2  \"Spike Lee Biography.\" Bio.com.
