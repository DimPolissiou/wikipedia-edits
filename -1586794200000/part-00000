Cleverdon]] at the College of Aeronautics at [[Cranfield University]] in the 1960s, to evaluate the efficiency of [[Subject indexing|indexing systems]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Cleverdon | first=C.W. | title=The Aslib Cranfield Research Project on the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems | journal=Aslib Proceedings | publisher=Emerald | volume=12 | issue=12 | year=1960 | issn=0001-253X | doi=10.1108/eb049778 | pages=421\u2013431}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Cleverdon | first=Cyril | title=The Cranfield Tests on Index Language Devices | journal=Aslib Proceedings | publisher=Emerald | volume=19 | issue=6 | year=1967 | issn=0001-253X | doi=10.1108/eb050097 | pages=173\u2013194}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cleverdon |first=C.

Vol. 1: Design, Vol. 2: Results |location=Cranfield, UK |publisher=Aslib Cranfield Research Project}}</ref> The experiments were broken into two main phases, neither of which was computerized. The entire collection of abstracts, resulting indexes and results were later distributed in electronic format and were widely used for decades.\n\nIn the first series of experiments, several existing indexing methods were compared to test their efficiency. The queries were generated by the authors of the papers in the collection and then translated into index lookups by experts in those systems. In this series, one method went from least efficient to most efficient after making minor changes to the arrangement of the way the data was recorded on the [[index card]]s. The conclusion appeared to be that the exact methodology seemed less important than specific details of the implementation. This led to considerable debate on the methodology of the experiments.\n\nThese criticisms also led to the second series of experiments, now known as Cranfield 2. Cranfield 2 attempted to gain additional insight by reversing the methodology; Cranfield 1 tested the ability for experts to find a specific resource following the index system, Cranfield 2 instead studied the results of asking human-language questions and seeing if the indexing system provided a relevant answer, regardless of whether it was the original target document. It too was the topic of considerable debate.\n\nThe Cranfield experiments were extremely influential in the information retrieval field, itself a subject of considerable interest in the post-[[World War II]] era when the quantity of scientific research was exploding. It was the topic of continual debate for years and led to several computer projects to test its results. Its influence was considerable over a forty-year period before [[natural language]] indexes like those of modern [[web search engines]] became commonplace.\n\n==Background==\nThe now-famous July 1945 article \"[[As We May Think]]\" by [[Vannevar Bush]] is often pointed to as the first complete description of the field that became [[information retrieval]]. The article describes a hypothetical machine known as \"[[memex]]\" that would hold all of mankind's knowledge in an indexed form that would allow it to be retrieved by anyone.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Buckland |last=Buckland |first=Michael K. |title=Emanuel Goldberg, Electronic Document Retrieval, and Vannevar Bush's Memex |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science |volume=43 |issue=4 |date=May 1992 |pages=284\u201394 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199205)43:4<284::AID-ASI3>3.0.CO;2-0 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, the [[Royal Society]] held the Scientific Information Conference that first explored some of these concepts on a formal basis. This led to a small number of experiments in the field in the UK, US, and the Netherlands. A second conference on the topic, the International Conference on Scientific Information, was held in [[Washington, DC]] in 1958, by which time computer development had reached the point where automatic index retrieval was possible. It was at this meeting that [[Cyril W. Cleverdon]] \"got the bit between his teeth\" and managed to arrange for funding from the [[US National Science Foundation]] to start what would later be known as Cranfield 1.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\n==Cranfield 1==\nThe first series of experiments directly compared four indexing systems that represented significantly different conceptual underpinnings. The four systems were the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], a hierarchical system being widely introduced in libraries, the Alphabetical Subject Catalogue which alphabetized subject headings in classic library [[index card]] collections, the [[Faceted classification|Faceted Classification Scheme]] which allows combinations of subjects to produce new subjects, and [[Mortimer Taube]]'s [[Uniterm]] system of co-ordinate indexing where a reference may be found on any number of separate index cards.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nIn an early series of experiments, participants were asked to create indexes for a collection of [[aerospace]]-related documents. Each index was prepared by an expert in that methodology. The authors of the original documents were then asked to prepare a set of search terms that should return that document. The indexing experts were then asked to generate queries into their index based on the author's search terms. The queries were then used to examine the index to see if it returned the target document.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nIn these tests, all but the faceted system produced roughly equal numbers of \"correct\" results, while the faceted concept lagged. Studying these results, the faceted system was re-indexed using a different format on the cards and the tests were re-run. In this series of tests, the faceted system was now the clear winner. This suggested the underlying theory behind the system was less important than specifics of the implementation.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nThe outcome of these experiments, published in 1962, generated enormous debate, both among the supporters of the various systems, as well as among researchers who complained about the experiments as a whole.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4}}\n\n==Cranfield 2==\nIn the first series of experiments, experts in the use of the various techniques were tasked with both the creation of the index and its use against the sample queries. Each system had its own concept about how a query should be structured, which would today be known as a [[query language]]. Much of the criticism of the first experiments focused on whether the experiments were truly testing the systems, or the user's ability to translate the query into the query language.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nThis led to the second series of experiments, Cranfield 2, that considered the question of converting the query into the language. To do this, instead of considering the generation of the query as a [[black box]], each step was broken down. The outcome of this approach was revolutionary at the time; it suggested that the search terms be left in their original format, what would today be known as a [[natural language query]].{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nAnother major change was how the results were judged. In the original tests, a success occurred only if the index returned the exact document that had been used to generate the search. However, this was not typical of an actual query; a user looking for information on aircraft [[landing gear]] might be happy with any of many papers on the topic, but Cranfield 1 would consider such a result a failure in spite of being relevant. In this series, the results were judged by 3rd parties who gave a qualitative answer on whether the query generated a relevant set of papers, as opposed to returning a specified original document.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4}}\n\n==Continued debate==\nThe results of the two test series continued to be a subject of considerable debate for years. In particular, it led to a running debate between Cleverdon and [[Jason Farradane]], one of the founders of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Institute of Information Scientists]] in 1958. The two would invariably appear at meetings where the other was presenting and then, during the [[question]] and [[Answer (response)|answer]] period, explain why everything they were doing was wrong. The debate has been characterized as \"...fierce and unrelenting, sometimes well beyond the boundaries of civility.\"{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4}} This chorus was joined by [[Don R. Swanson]] in the US, who published a critique on the Cranfield experiments a few years later.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4}}\n\nIn spite of these criticisms, Cranfield 2 set the bar by which many following experiments were judged. In particular, Cranfield 2's methodology, starting with natural language terms and judging the results by relevance, not exact matches, became almost universal in following experiments in spite of many objections.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4}}\n\n==Influence==\nWith the conclusion of Cranfield 2 in 1967, the entire corpus was published in a machine-readable form.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=7}} Today, this is known as the Cranfield 1400, or any variety of variations on that theme. The name refers to the number of documents in the collection, which consists of 1398 abstracts. The collection also includes 225 queries and the relevance judgments of all query:document pairs that resulted from the experimental runs.{{sfn|Manning|Raghavan|Sch\u00fctze|2008}} The main database of abstracts is about 1.6&nbsp;MB.{{sfn|CRANFIELD}}\n\nThe experiments were carried out in an era when computers had a few [[kilobyte]]s of [[main memory]] and network access to perhaps a few [[megabyte]]s. For instance, the mid-range [[IBM System/360|IBM System/360 Model 50]] shipped with 64 to 512&nbsp;kB of [[core memory]]<ref>{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/funcChar/A22-6898-1_360-50_funcChar_1967.pdf|title=IBM System/360 Model 50 Functional Characteristics|publisher=IBM|year=1967|id=A22-6898-1}}</ref> (tending toward the lower end) and its typical [[hard drive]] stored just over 80&nbsp;MB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_1302.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 1302 disk storage unit |publisher=IBM|date= 2003-01-23|accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> As the capabilities of systems grew through the 1960s and 1970s, the Cranfield document collection became a major testbed corpus that was used repeatedly for many years.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|pp=5,7}}\n\nToday the collection is too small to use for practical testing beyond pilot experiments.

The entire collection of abstracts, resulting indexes and results were later distributed in electronic format and were widely used for decades.\n\nIn the first series of experiments, several existing indexing methods were compared to test their efficiency. The queries were generated by the authors of the papers in the collection and then translated into index lookups by experts in those systems. In this series, one method went from least efficient to most efficient after making minor changes to the arrangement of the way the data was recorded on the [[index card]]s. The conclusion appeared to be that the exact methodology seemed less important than specific details of the implementation. This led to considerable debate on the methodology of the experiments. The index and test results were later distributed in electronic format and were widely used for decades.\n\nThese criticisms also led to the second series of experiments, now known as Cranfield 2. Cranfield 2 attempted to gain additional insight by reversing the methodology; Cranfield 1 tested the ability for experts to find a specific resource following the index system, Cranfield 2 instead studied the results of asking human-language questions and seeing if the indexing system provided a relevant answer, regardless of whether it was the original target document. It too was the topic of considerable debate.\n\nThe Cranfield experiments were extremely influential in the information retrieval field, itself a subject of considerable interest in the post-[[World War II]] era when the quantity of scientific research was exploding. It was the topic of continual debate for years and led to several computer projects to test its results. Its influence was considerable over a forty-year period before [[natural language]] indexes like those of modern [[web search engines]] became commonplace.\n\n==Background==\nThe now-famous July 1945 article \"[[As We May Think]]\" by [[Vannevar Bush]] is often pointed to as the first complete description of the field that became [[information retrieval]]. The article describes a hypothetical machine known as \"[[memex]]\" that would hold all of mankind's knowledge in an indexed form that would allow it to be retrieved by anyone.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Buckland |last=Buckland |first=Michael K. |title=Emanuel Goldberg, Electronic Document Retrieval, and Vannevar Bush's Memex |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science |volume=43 |issue=4 |date=May 1992 |pages=284\u201394 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199205)43:4<284::AID-ASI3>3.0.CO;2-0 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, the [[Royal Society]] held the Scientific Information Conference that first explored some of these concepts on a formal basis. This led to a small number of experiments in the field in the UK, US, and the Netherlands. A second conference on the topic, the International Conference on Scientific Information, was held in [[Washington, DC]] in 1958, by which time computer development had reached the point where automatic index retrieval was possible. It was at this meeting that [[Cyril W. Cleverdon]] \"got the bit between his teeth\" and managed to arrange for funding from the [[US National Science Foundation]] to start what would later be known as Cranfield 1.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\n==Cranfield 1==\nThe first series of experiments directly compared four indexing systems that represented significantly different conceptual underpinnings. The four systems were the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], a hierarchical system being widely introduced in libraries, the Alphabetical Subject Catalogue which alphabetized subject headings in classic library [[index card]] collections, the [[Faceted classification|Faceted Classification Scheme]] which allows combinations of subjects to produce new subjects, and [[Mortimer Taube]]'s [[Uniterm]] system of co-ordinate indexing where a reference may be found on any number of separate index cards.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nIn an early series of experiments, participants were asked to create indexes for a collection of [[aerospace]]-related documents. Each index was prepared by an expert in that methodology. The authors of the original documents were then asked to prepare a set of search terms that should return that document. The indexing experts were then asked to generate queries into their index based on the author's search terms. The queries were then used to examine the index to see if it returned the target document.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nIn these tests, all but the faceted system produced roughly equal numbers of \"correct\" results, while the faceted concept lagged. Studying these results, the faceted system was re-indexed using a different format on the cards and the tests were re-run. In this series of tests, the faceted system was now the clear winner. This suggested the underlying theory behind the system was less important than specifics of the implementation.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=3}}\n\nThe outcome of these experiments, published in 1962, generated enormous debate, both among the supporters of the various systems, as well as among researchers who complained about the experiments as a whole.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4}}\n\n==Cranfield 2==\nIn the first series of experiments, experts in the use of the various techniques were tasked with both the creation of the index and its use against the sample queries.

[[Michael Dorn]] plays [[Worf]], the first [[Klingon]] officer in Starfleet, alongside [[Gates McFadden]] as Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]], [[LeVar Burton]] as chief engineer [[Geordi La Forge]], the android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] portrayed by [[Brent Spiner]], and Dr. Crusher's son [[Wesley Crusher]] played by [[Wil Wheaton]].\n\nThe series premiered on September 28, 1987 and ran for seven seasons, ending on May 23, 1994. It had the highest ratings of any of the ''Star Trek'' series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run, allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series. Many relationships and races introduced in ''TNG'' became the basis of episodes in ''Deep Space Nine'' and ''Voyager''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/history.html|title=Star Trek - A Short History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ee.surrey.ac.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205052936/http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/history.html|archive-date=2010-12-05|access-date=2006-08-21}}</ref> During its run it earned several [[Emmy Award]]s and nominations\u2014including a nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final season\u2014two [[Hugo Award]]s and a [[Peabody Award]] for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode \"[[The Big Goodbye]]\".<ref name=\"TNG Emmy\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/tng/intro.shtml|title=BBC Online - Cult - Star Trek - Next Generation - Trivia|website=[[BBC]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231192511/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/tng/intro.shtml|archive-date=2006-12-31|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> The series was released in [[Star Trek: The Next Generation#High-definition and Blu-ray project|high definition on Blu-Ray]] and [[Netflix]] with some special effect changes in the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekcore.com/blog/2015/08/netflix-brings-vfx-fixes-to-star-trek-tng-in-hd/|title=Netflix Brings VFX Fixes to STAR TREK: TNG in HD|author=TrekCore Staff|website=TrekCore Blog}}</ref>\n\n===''Deep Space Nine'' (1993\u20131999)===\n[[File:AveryBrooksAtConvention crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Avery Brooks]] played Captain Benjamin Sisko in ''Deep Space Nine,'' commander of the titular space station.]]\n{{Main|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine}}\n'''''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''''', frequently abbreviated as '''''DS9''''', takes place during the last years and the immediate post-years of ''The Next Generation'' (2369\u20132375) and aired for seven seasons, debuting the week of January 3, 1993. Like ''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'' aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other ''Star Trek'' series, ''DS9'' takes place primarily on a [[space station]] rather than aboard a starship.\n\nThe series begins after the brutal [[Cardassian]] occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian-built space station, [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the series discover a uniquely stable [[wormhole]] that provides immediate access to the distant [[List of Star Trek regions of space#Galactic Quadrants|Gamma Quadrant]] making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Emissary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i|title=Emissary, Part I {{!}} Star Trek|website=www.startrek.com|access-date=2006-08-21}}</ref> The series chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) [[Benjamin Sisko]], played by [[Avery Brooks]], and Major (later Colonel) [[Kira Nerys]], played by [[Nana Visitor]]. Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, Sisko's spiritual role for the [[Bajoran]]s as the Emissary of the [[Bajoran#Prophets|Prophets]], and in later seasons a war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].\n\n''Deep Space Nine'' stands apart from earlier ''Trek'' series for its lengthy serialized storytelling, conflict within the crew, and religious themes\u2014all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and ''The Next Generation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scifi.about.com/blinterarma2.htm|title=Review of \"Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges\" - Star Trek Fans|website=scifi.about.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407175159/http://scifi.about.com/blinterarma2.htm|archivedate=2003-04-07|access-date=2006-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===''Voyager'' (1995\u20132001)===\n[[File:Kate Mulgrew Shankbone Metropolitan Opera 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kate Mulgrew]] played Captain Kathryn Janeway, the lead character in ''Voyager,'' and the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a ''Star Trek'' series.]]\n{{Main|Star Trek: Voyager}}\n'''''Star Trek: Voyager''''' ran for seven seasons, airing from January 16, 1995, to May 23, 2001, launching a new Paramount-owned television network, [[UPN]].

Like ''Deep Space Nine'', early seasons of ''Voyager'' feature more conflict between its crew members than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of ''The Original Series''. Isolated from its home, the starship ''Voyager'' faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in other series based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons brought in an influx of characters and cultures from prior series, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], the [[Ferengi]], [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Cardassian]]s and cast members of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n===''Enterprise'' (2001\u20132005)===\n[[File:Scott Bakula by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scott Bakula]] played Captain Jonathan Archer, the lead character in ''Enterprise''.]]\n{{Main|Star Trek: Enterprise}}\n'''''Star Trek: Enterprise''''', originally titled '''''Enterprise''''', is a prequel to the original ''Star Trek'' series.

The series centers on the voyages of Earth's first warp 5 capable starship, ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', commanded by Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] (played by [[Scott Bakula]]), and the Vulcan Sub-Commander [[T'Pol]] (played by [[Jolene Blalock]]). The series originally did not include \"''Star Trek''\" in its name and logo, adding it later on in the series' run.\n\nDuring the series' first two seasons, ''Enterprise'' featured self-contained episodes, like ''The Original Series'', ''The Next Generation'' and ''Voyager''. The entire [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 3)|third season]] consisted of one arc related to the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]], and had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of ''Deep Space Nine''. The fourth and final season consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of some elements of previous series, and resolved some of their continuity problems. Ratings for ''Enterprise'' started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast criticized the [[These Are the Voyages...#Reception|series finale]], partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of cast members of ''The Next Generation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale {{!}} Movie and TV Reviews {{!}} SCI FI Weekly|last=Lee|first=Patrick|date=2005-05-14|website=www.scifi.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|archivedate=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=43a43f1175dcc&topBrowse=all|title=TrekWeb.com -

The massive worldwide box office success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than ''Star Wars'' could do well at the box office, and production of ''Phase II'' was cancelled in favor of making a ''Star Trek'' film.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for ''Phase II'' were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $45 million due to costly effects work and delays.\n\n====''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (1982)====\n{{Main|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan}}\n[[Khan Noonien Singh]] ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the ''Enterprise'' fifteen years earlier (\"[[Space Seed]]\"), seeks his revenge on the Admiral and lays a cunning and sinister trap.\n\n''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget. After Roddenberry pitched a film in which the crew of the ''Enterprise'' goes back in time to ensure the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], he was \"kicked upstairs\" to a ceremonial role while Paramount brought in television producer [[Harve Bennett]] to craft a better\u2014and cheaper\u2014film than the first.<ref name=\"rioux-240\">Rioux, 240.</ref> After watching all the television episodes, Bennett decided that the character [[Khan Noonien Singh]] was the perfect villain for the new film. Director [[Nicholas Meyer]] finished a complete screenplay in just twelve days, and did everything possible within budget to give ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|The Wrath of Khan]]'' a nautical, swashbuckling feel,<ref>{{cite video|people=''Star Trek'' cast and crew|date=August 6, 2002|title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, The Directors Edition: Special Features|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|medium=DVD; Disc 2/2}}</ref> which he described as \"[[Horatio Hornblower]] in outer space.\"<ref name=\"rioux-240\"/> Upon release, the reception of ''The Wrath of Khan'' was highly positive;<ref>{{cite book|author=Meyers, Richard|year=1990|title=The Great Science Fiction Films|location=New York|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|isbn=0-8065-1084-6|pages=229\u2013231}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Mark Bernadin called ''The Wrath of Khan'' \"the film that, by most accounts, saved ''Star Trek'' as we know it\".<ref name=\"ew-best\">{{cite web|author=Bernardin, Mark|date=August 13, 2002|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,335196,00.html|title=Review; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan \u2013 The Director's Edition|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBoth the first and second films have television versions with additional footage and alternate takes that affect the storyline. (Subsequent ''Star Trek'' films tended to have shorter television versions). Especially notable in ''The Wrath of Khan'' is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the ''Enterprise'' is Scotty's nephew.\n\n====''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' (1984)====\n{{Main|Star Trek III: The Search for Spock}}\nThe plot picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous film. When McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his ''[[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Katra|katra]]'', his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the ''Enterprise'' and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a renegade Klingon ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences.\n\nMeyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member [[Leonard Nimoy]]. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|Star Trek III]]'' the day after ''The Wrath of Khan'' opened.<ref name=\"rioux-251\">Rioux, 251.</ref> The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \"[[Amok Time]]\".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n{{Main|Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home}}\nWhile returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of [[humpback whale]]s. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist ([[Catherine Hicks]]) to care for them.\n\nNimoy returned as director for this film. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a [[time travel]] story with the ''Enterprise'' crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their present\u2014eventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by [[Daniel Petrie Jr.]], Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' for elements of the screenplay.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Star [[William Shatner]] was promised his turn as director for ''Star Trek V'', and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for ''Star Trek VI''.\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\n{{Main|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier}}\nSpock's half-brother ([[Laurence Luckinbill]]) believes he is summoned by [[God]], and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|''Enterprise''-A]] to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the [[Milky Way]], beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and arrogant Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk.\n\nThis is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner.\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\n{{Main|Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country}}\nWhen [[Klingon#Homeworld|Qo'noS]]' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion, caused by over-mining, the catastrophe also contaminating Qo'noS' atmosphere, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. While on the way to Earth for a peace summit, the Klingon Chancellor ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) is assassinated by ''Enterprise'' crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff ([[Christopher Plummer]]). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides.\n\nThis film is a sendoff to the original series cast. One ''Next Generation'' cast member, [[Michael Dorn]], appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series, [[Worf]]. It is the second and last ''Star Trek'' film directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]] and last screenplay co-authored by Leonard Nimoy.\n\n===''The Next Generation'' films===\nBoth the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the ''Next Generation'' cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and [[Star Trek Generations|the seventh]] focusing on the ''TNG'' cast. The ''Next Generation'' cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (''Insurrection'') and disappointingly (''Nemesis'') at the box office.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

This film also included original crew members Scotty ([[James Doohan]]) and Chekov ([[Walter Koenig]]).\n\nFollowing seven seasons of ''The Next Generation'', the next ''Star Trek'' film was the first to feature the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]], along with a long prologue sequence featuring three cast members of the original series and the only appearance of the ''Enterprise-B''.\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: First Contact}}\nAfter a failed attempt to assault Earth, the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans by interfering with [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s ([[James Cromwell]]) warp test in the past.

However, the admiral himself is a pawn in his alien partner's ([[F.

The ''Enterprise'', its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned.\n\nThis revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a \"reboot\", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a [[reboot (fiction)|traditional reboot]], to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \"disrespectful\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \"Abramsverse\", \"JJ Trek\" and \"NuTrek\", before it was named the \"Kelvin Timeline\" (versus the \"Prime Timeline\" of the original series and films) by [[Michael Okuda|Michael]] and [[Denise Okuda]] for use in official ''Star Trek'' reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS ''Kelvin'', a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009).

Nero then captures Spock and uses the black-hole technology to destroy Vulcan. Spock's present-day younger self ([[Zachary Quinto]]), who is a Starfleet Academy instructor, and a volatile and arrogant cadet named James Kirk ([[Chris Pine]]) must then set aside their current differences, and join forces to prevent Nero from consigning Earth and the rest of the Federation worlds to similar fates.\n\nThis film acts as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] to the existing franchise by taking place in an \"alternate reality\" using the plot device of time travel to depict an altered timeline (known as the ''[[Star Trek canon#\"Reboot\" films|Kelvin Timeline]]'', after the ship destroyed in the opening scene),<ref name=\"auto1\"/> featuring younger versions of the original series' cast.

Like ''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'' aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other ''Star Trek'' series, ''DS9'' takes place primarily on a [[space station]] rather than aboard a starship.\n\nThe series begins after the brutal [[Cardassian]] occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian-built space station, [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the series discover a uniquely stable [[wormhole]] that provides immediate access to the distant [[List of Star Trek regions of space#Galactic Quadrants|Gamma Quadrant]] making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Emissary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i|title=Emissary, Part I {{!}} Star Trek|website=www.startrek.com|access-date=2006-08-21}}</ref> The series chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) [[Benjamin Sisko]], played by [[Avery Brooks]], and Major (later Colonel) [[Kira Nerys]], played by [[Nana Visitor]].

Like ''Deep Space Nine'', early seasons of ''Voyager'' feature more conflict between its crew members than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of ''The Original Series''. Isolated from its home, the starship ''Voyager'' faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in other series based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons brought in an influx of characters and cultures from prior series, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], the [[Ferengi]], [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Cardassian]]s and cast members of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n===''Enterprise'' (2001\u20132005)===\n[[File:Scott Bakula by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scott Bakula]] played Captain Jonathan Archer, the lead character in ''Enterprise''.]]\n{{Main|Star Trek: Enterprise}}\n'''''Star Trek: Enterprise''''', originally titled '''''Enterprise''''', is a prequel to the original ''Star Trek'' series.

The series centers on the voyages of Earth's first warp 5 capable starship, ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', commanded by Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] (played by [[Scott Bakula]]), and the Vulcan Sub-Commander [[T'Pol]] (played by [[Jolene Blalock]]). The series originally did not include \"''Star Trek''\" in its name and logo, adding it later on in the series' run.\n\nDuring the series' first two seasons, ''Enterprise'' featured self-contained episodes, like ''The Original Series'', ''The Next Generation'' and ''Voyager''. The entire [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 3)|third season]] consisted of one arc related to the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]], and had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of ''Deep Space Nine''. The fourth and final season consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of some elements of previous series, and resolved some of their continuity problems. Ratings for ''Enterprise'' started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast criticized the [[These Are the Voyages...#Reception|series finale]], partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of cast members of ''The Next Generation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale {{!}} Movie and TV Reviews {{!}} SCI FI Weekly|last=Lee|first=Patrick|date=2005-05-14|website=www.scifi.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|archivedate=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=43a43f1175dcc&topBrowse=all|title=TrekWeb.com -

Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, ''[[Star Trek: Phase II|Phase II]]''. The massive worldwide box office success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than ''Star Wars'' could do well at the box office, and production of ''Phase II'' was cancelled in favor of making a ''Star Trek'' film.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for ''Phase II'' were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $45 million due to costly effects work and delays.\n\n====''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (1982)====\n{{Main|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan}}\n[[Khan Noonien Singh]] ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the ''Enterprise'' fifteen years earlier (\"[[Space Seed]]\"), seeks his revenge on the Admiral and lays a cunning and sinister trap.\n\n''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget.

(Subsequent ''Star Trek'' films tended to have shorter television versions). Especially notable in ''The Wrath of Khan'' is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the ''Enterprise'' is Scotty's nephew.\n\n====''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' (1984)====\n{{Main|Star Trek III: The Search for Spock}}\nThe plot picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous film. When McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his ''[[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Katra|katra]]'', his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the ''Enterprise'' and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a renegade Klingon ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences.\n\nMeyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member [[Leonard Nimoy]]. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|Star Trek III]]'' the day after ''The Wrath of Khan'' opened.<ref name=\"rioux-251\">Rioux, 251.</ref> The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \"[[Amok Time]]\".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n{{Main|Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home}}\nWhile returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of [[humpback whale]]s. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist ([[Catherine Hicks]]) to care for them.\n\nNimoy returned as director for this film. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a [[time travel]] story with the ''Enterprise'' crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their present\u2014eventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by [[Daniel Petrie Jr.]], Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' for elements of the screenplay.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Star [[William Shatner]] was promised his turn as director for ''Star Trek V'', and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for ''Star Trek VI''.\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\n{{Main|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier}}\nSpock's half-brother ([[Laurence Luckinbill]]) believes he is summoned by [[God]], and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|''Enterprise''-A]] to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the [[Milky Way]], beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and arrogant Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk.\n\nThis is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner.\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\n{{Main|Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country}}\nWhen [[Klingon#Homeworld|Qo'noS]]' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion, caused by over-mining, the catastrophe also contaminating Qo'noS' atmosphere, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. While on the way to Earth for a peace summit, the Klingon Chancellor ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) is assassinated by ''Enterprise'' crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff ([[Christopher Plummer]]). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides.\n\nThis film is a sendoff to the original series cast. One ''Next Generation'' cast member, [[Michael Dorn]], appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series, [[Worf]]. It is the second and last ''Star Trek'' film directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]] and last screenplay co-authored by Leonard Nimoy.\n\n===''The Next Generation'' films===\nBoth the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the ''Next Generation'' cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and [[Star Trek Generations|the seventh]] focusing on the ''TNG'' cast. The ''Next Generation'' cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (''Insurrection'') and disappointingly (''Nemesis'') at the box office.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

This film also included original crew members Scotty ([[James Doohan]]) and Chekov ([[Walter Koenig]]).\n\nFollowing seven seasons of ''The Next Generation'', the next ''Star Trek'' film was the first to feature the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]], along with a long prologue sequence featuring three cast members of the original series and the only appearance of the ''Enterprise-B''.\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: First Contact}}\nAfter a failed attempt to assault Earth, the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans by interfering with [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s ([[James Cromwell]]) warp test in the past.

However, the admiral himself is a pawn in his alien partner's ([[F. Murray Abraham]]) mission of vengeance.\n\n''Insurrection'' brought in ''Deep Space Nine'' writer Michael Piller instead of Ronald D.

The ''Enterprise'', its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned.\n\nThis revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a \"reboot\", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a [[reboot (fiction)|traditional reboot]], to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \"disrespectful\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \"Abramsverse\", \"JJ Trek\" and \"NuTrek\", before it was named the \"Kelvin Timeline\" (versus the \"Prime Timeline\" of the original series and films) by [[Michael Okuda|Michael]] and [[Denise Okuda]] for use in official ''Star Trek'' reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS ''Kelvin'', a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009). Abrams named the starship after his grandfather Henry Kelvin, whom he also pays tribute to in ''Into Darkness'' with the Kelvin Memorial Archive.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|title=\"The Kelvin Timeline\"- Official Name for the New Star Trek Universe|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/popculture/the-kelvin-timeline-official-name-for-the-new-star-trek-universe/vp-AAhGc7S|publisher=MSN|accessdate=July 24, 2016|date=June 27, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819105802/https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/popculture/the-kelvin-timeline-official-name-for-the-new-star-trek-universe/vp-AAhGc7S|archivedate=August 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=TrekCore|title=STAR TREK Alternate Universe Finally Gets Official Name {{!}} TrekCore Blog|url=http://trekcore.com/blog/2016/06/star-trek-alternate-universe-finally-gets-official-name/|website=trekcore.com|accessdate=July 24, 2016|date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

Piloting a one-man vessel, Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) attempts to contain the supernova by generating an artificial black hole, but is assaulted by a Romulan mining vessel captained by Nero ([[Eric Bana]]), who is bent on vengeance for Spock's failure to save Romulus; both vessels are pulled into the black hole and sent back in time to the 23rd century. Nero then captures Spock and uses the black-hole technology to destroy Vulcan. Spock's present-day younger self ([[Zachary Quinto]]), who is a Starfleet Academy instructor, and a volatile and arrogant cadet named James Kirk ([[Chris Pine]]) must then set aside their current differences, and join forces to prevent Nero from consigning Earth and the rest of the Federation worlds to similar fates.\n\nThis film acts as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] to the existing franchise by taking place in an \"alternate reality\" using the plot device of time travel to depict an altered timeline (known as the ''[[Star Trek canon#\"Reboot\" films|Kelvin Timeline]]'', after the ship destroyed in the opening scene),<ref name=\"auto1\"/> featuring younger versions of the original series' cast. It is the first production to feature an entirely different cast of actors playing roles previously established by other actors, with the exception of an aged Spock played by [[Leonard Nimoy]]. It was directed by [[J. J. Abrams]] (who produced it with [[Damon Lindelof]]) and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. According to Lindelof, this production was designed to attract a wider audience.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://trekmovie.com/2008/03/01/exclusive-interview-damon-lindelof-on-new-release-date-and-trek-appealing-to-wider-audience/ |title=Exclusive Interview: Damon Lindelof On New Release Date and Trek Appealing To Wider Audience |publisher=TrekMovie.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> It received positive reviews<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_11/ | title=Star Trek | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/star-trek | title=Star Trek (2009): Reviews | website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/movies/score/metascore/year?sort=desc&view=condensed&year_selected=2009|title=Movie Releases by Score (2009) |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref> and a [[Star Trek (film)#Accolades|number of awards]], including the film franchise's only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], for \"[[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling#2000s|makeup and hairstyling]]\".

The crew of the ''Enterprise'' attempt to bring him to justice without provoking war with the Klingon Empire, but find there is much more to the agent's mission, and the man himself, than what the Fleet Admiral ([[Peter Weller]]) has told them; the agent is none other than [[Khan Noonien Singh]]; his allegiance and his motives are initially not at all clear.\n\n====''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016)====\n{{Main|Star Trek Beyond}}\nThe ''Enterprise'' is ambushed and destroyed by countless alien micro-vessels; the crew abandon ship. Stranded on an unknown planet, and with no apparent means of escape or rescue, they find themselves in conflict with a new sociopathic enemy ([[Idris Elba]]) who has a well-earned hatred of the Federation and what it stands for.\n\n''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' was released on July 22, 2016, in time for the franchise's 50th anniversary celebrations.

It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband, Brently Mallard, is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s.<ref name=\":2\" /> In ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'', [[Emily Toth]] argues that Chopin \"had to have her heroine die\" in order to make the story publishable\".<ref>Toth, Emily (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qh6TWsIk-WsC&pg=PA10 ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'']. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, p. 10, {{ISBN|978-1-57806-101-3}}.</ref> (The \"heroine\" dies when she sees her husband alive after he was thought to be dead.)\n\n==Summary==\n\"The Story of an Hour\" follows Louise Mallard as she deals with the news of her husband Brently's death. After being informed of her husband Brently's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died. Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease.  \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>.\n==Irony==\nThe irony of the death of Louise Mallard is something that plays a big role in the layout of the story. They say that she died from the joy that kills. She killed herself, not knowing that that would be the thing to kill her. She was finally realizing that she was happy without Brently in her life. Then when he arrives back at home, she realizes that she is no longer happy again and that her life is just going to go back to the way it was before she thought he was dead. She ends up dying of heart complications, which in turn in the irony because we could read the story and see that she was going to die a lonely and almost depressed life. Then, she really ends up dying from her own joy killing her because she was excited to finally not have to deal with her husband.<ref>https://mycourses.purdue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabaction?tab_tab_group_id=_17_1</ref>\n==Themes==\n\"The Story of an Hour\" really focuses on the women's search to find their own identities within themselves. Chopin, herself, liked to call this the \"possession of self-assertion.\" We can see by reading this story that she has brought her own life into the story. This story is like the background of Chopin. She had those rocky marriages. She was looking to find her own identity within herself. Louise is the Chopin during this story. She struggled to find herself many of times. This theme seems to really help Kate Chopin get an understanding of her own life during the times she was in. <ref>https://www.katechopin.org/the-story-of-an-hour/#themes</ref>\n\n==Critical responses==\nBert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459\u2013473.</ref>\n\nLawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L.

Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\nWhile most readers infer Kate Chopin\u2019s \u201cThe Story of an Hour\u201d tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man\u2019s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there\u2019s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201croomy\u201d armchairs, and how one armchair sat \u201cfacing the open window\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife \u2014A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>\n\nIn the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn\u2019t feel the same.

Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was \u201cpressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul\u201d simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change.

Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of \u201cjoy that kills\u201d one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. \n\nInstead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.

It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband, Brently Mallard, is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s.<ref name=\":2\" /> In ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'', [[Emily Toth]] argues that Chopin \"had to have her heroine die\" in order to make the story publishable\".<ref>Toth, Emily (1999).

After being informed of her husband Brently's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died. Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease. \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>\n\n==Critical responses==\nBert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459\u2013473.</ref>\n\nLawrence I.

However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\".

They get most of their rice now from Bangued, while other mountain municipalities supplied some of the rice needs of some nearby lowland municipalities.\n\nRehabilitation have been on the communal facilities such as roads, trails, irrigation systems, footbridges and rice fields by the Masadiit Farmers Cooperative Inc. (MFCI) with the fund amounting to {{Philippine peso|2,903 million}} from the Presidential Management Staff and by the Inter NGO Disaster Relief Services (INDRS) with the fund amounting {{Dollar sign|CAD|lk=on}}292,516.00, {{Philippine peso|7 million}} from [[Oxfam]].\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016|small=y}}\n\nBoliney is situated {{convert|62|km}} from the capital town of [[Bangued, Abra|Bangued]], and can be reached by road which was completed in 1974. Prior to this, it was accessible only by hiking a {{convert|24|km|adj=on}} long mountain trail.\n\nAfter 1974, the road was extended by about {{convert|14|km}} before reaching Danac, the farthest barangay. The present-day road is now as far as the [[Poblacion]]; however, the rest of the road has been abandoned.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre    = Boliney\n| North     = {{nowrap|[[Bucloc, Abra|Bucloc]] / [[Daguioman, Abra|Daguioman]]}}\n| East      = [[Pasil,&nbsp;Kalinga]]\n| South     = [[Tubo, Abra|Tubo]]\n| Southwest = [[Luba, Abra|Luba]]\n| West      = [[Manabo, Abra|Manabo]]\n| Northwest = [[Sallapadan, Abra|Sallapadan]]\n}}\n{{Abra|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Abra (province)]]\n", "name_user": "P199", "label": "safe", "comment": "map formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boliney"}
