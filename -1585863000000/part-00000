Other churches (predominantly Protestant) are generally considered either part of the harlot or her daughters. Adventists further hold that the persecution of the \"saints\" in Revelation 17:6 represents the persecution of believers who rejected the doctrines introduced by the Roman Catholic Church and were based on pagan Roman beliefs. The Persecution during the [[Middle Ages]] of anyone who opposed the Catholic Church, especially by the [[Inquisition]], and the persecution of the [[Waldensians]] and the [[Huguenot]]s are cited as examples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amazingdiscoveries.org/R-Reformation_Rome_crusade_slaughter|title=Timeline of Bloody History of Papal Rome \u2013 Oppression of Protestants|work=Amazing Discoveries}}</ref>\n\nSeventh-day Adventists interpret Revelation 17:18 as a prophecy of the false church, which has power over the kings of the earth. They consider the [[pope]] to be in apostasy for allowing pagan rituals, beliefs and ceremonies to come into the church. They consider the Papacy, as a continuation of the Roman Empire, as a fulfillment of {{bibleverse|2 Thessalonians|2:7}}: \"For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[Ellen G. White]]'s ''[[The Great Controversy (book)|The Great Controversy]]'' (1858) states that \"Spiritual Babylon\" would have worldwide influence, affecting \"all nations\", that Imperial Roman Empire could not meet the criteria, as she wrote that it only had influence in the [[Old World]]. Like many reformation-era Protestant leaders, her writings also describe the [[Catholic Church]] as a fallen church, and it plays a nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's true church and that the pope is the Antichrist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44|title=White Horse Media|author=Austin Best|work=whitehorsemedia.com}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book| last = White| first = Ellen G.| authorlink = Ellen G.

Other churches (predominantly Protestant) are generally considered either part of the harlot or her daughters. Adventists further hold that the persecution of the \"saints\" in Revelation 17:6 represents the persecution of believers who rejected the doctrines introduced by the Roman Catholic Church and were based on pagan Roman beliefs. The Persecution during the [[Middle Ages]] of anyone who opposed the Catholic Church, especially by the [[Inquisition]], and the persecution of the [[Waldensians]] and the [[Huguenot]]s are cited as examples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amazingdiscoveries.org/R-Reformation_Rome_crusade_slaughter|title=Timeline of Bloody History of Papal Rome \u2013 Oppression of Protestants|work=Amazing Discoveries}}</ref>\n\nSeventh-day Adventists interpret Revelation 17:18 as a prophecy of the false church, which has power over the kings of the earth. They consider the [[pope]] to be in apostasy for allowing pagan rituals, beliefs and ceremonies to come into the church. They consider the Papacy, as a continuation of the Roman Empire, as a fulfillment of {{bibleverse|2 Thessalonians|2:7}}: \"For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[Ellen G.
