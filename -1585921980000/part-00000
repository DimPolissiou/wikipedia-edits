Early broadcasting in all genres was live and sometimes performed repeatedly. Due to there being no means to record the broadcast, or because the content itself was thought to have little monetary or historical value it wasn't deemed necessary to save it. In the [[United Kingdom]], much early programming was lost due to contractual demands by the actors' union to limit the rescreening of recorded performances.\n\nApart from [[Phonovision]] experiments by [[John Logie Baird]], and some 280 rolls of 35mm film containing a number of [[Paul Nipkow television station]] broadcasts, no recordings of transmissions from 1939 or earlier are known to exist.\n\nIn 1947, [[Kinescope]] films became a viable method of recording broadcasts, but programs were only sporadically filmed or preserved. [[Tele-snaps]] of British television broadcasts also began in 1947 but are necessarily incomplete. Magnetic [[videotape]] technologies became a viable method to record and distribute material in 1956. Televised programming (especially that which was not considered viable for [[rerun]]s) was still considered disposable. What was recorded was routinely destroyed by [[wiping]] and reusing the tapes until the rise of the [[Videocassette recorder#The late 1970s: mass-market success|home video industry]] in the 1970s.\n\nThe ability for home viewers to record programming was extremely limited; although a home viewer could record the video of a broadcast by [[kinescope]] recording onto [[8 mm film]] throughout television history or record the audio of a broadcast onto [[audiotape]] beginning in the 1950s, one could generally not capture both on the same medium until [[Super 8 mm film|super-8]] debuted in the 1960s. Attempting to film a television broadcast using the kinescope process required positioning the camera directly in front of the screen, blocking the view of other people trying to watch. This would have been very disruptive to the television viewing experience and as such home movies of this kind are exceptionally rare. Audio recordings, which do not require obstructing the view of the screen are more common and numerous copies of otherwise lost television broadcasts exist. The growing availability of home video recording from the late 1970s was also a benefit for television producers and archivers as video tape was now economical enough for a home viewer to afford and enabled television networks the ability to save much of their programming as well.\n\n==Significant lost broadcasts==\n\n===Australia===\n\nLike most other countries, only a small portion of the early decades of Australian TV programming has survived. Many economic, technical, social and regulatory forces combined to prevent large-scale preservation of Australian programs from this period, and also contributed to the later destruction of most of what was recorded at the time. There was, and is, no regulatory requirement to lodge copies of programs with an archive authority such as the [[National Library of Australia]]. \n\nIn the first decade of Australian TV, 1956\u20131966, Australia produced very little original local content, compared to most other English-speaking nations. From the introduction of TV in Australia in 1956 to around 1964, the vast majority of locally produced original programming was made by the government-funded [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]. By June 1964, the ABC had produced 185 of the 212 plays, all 31 operas, and 90 of the 95 ballets shown on Australian TV in that period.<ref>Stuart Cunningham et al., The Media and Communications in Australia (Allen & Unwin, 2001, {{ISBN|978-1-86508-674-3}}), p.175</ref> Some of this was recorded, but little of that material has survived. \n\nNearly all of the relatively small amount of original content produced by the two commercial networks operating in the same period (mainly consisting of news, sport, talk, game shows, and variety shows) was broadcast live, and was rarely recorded. One of the best-known and most often seen surviving recordings from this period is the footage that purports to be the recording of the inaugural broadcast of TCN-9 Sydney on 16 September 1956, but this is in fact a fabrication \u2013 the actual broadcast was not recorded at the time, so the station restaged it some days later, for archival and promotional purposes.\n\nIn this early period, the technology then available to pre-record television programs, or to record live broadcasts 'off-air', was relatively primitive. Although Australia introduced TV rather later (1956) than comparable nations like the UK and the USA, the use of videotape did not become widespread in the Australian industry until the early 1960s, so only a small number of episodes from the earliest period have survived. Nearly all of that material is in I[[kinescope]] format.\n\nAlthough many important ABC programs from these early days were captured as telecine recordings, most of this material was later lost or destroyed. In a 1999 newspaper article on the subject, author [[Bob Ellis]] recounted the story of a large collection of historic telecine recordings of early ABC drama productions, and other programs, including some of the first Australian TV Shakespeare productions, and the pioneering popular music show ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]''. Learning that the ABC planned to dispose of these recordings, [[Bruce Beresford]] (then a production assistant at the ABC), arranged for a friend to pose as a silver nitrate dealer, and the anonymous collector purchased the films for a nominal cost. Subsequently, the collector occasionally rented some of the films out to schools for a small fee, but unfortunately, the daughter of one of the actors involved ([[Owen Weingott]]) recognised her father from a Shakespeare production, and told him about it. Assuming that the ABC still owned the print and was making money out of these recordings without compensating the actors, Weingott lodged an official complaint. Commonwealth police descended on the illegal collector, but he was warned that they were coming, and in a panic he destroyed almost all the material he possessed.<ref>Bob Ellis, \"The Lost Picture Show\", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 February 1999</ref>\n\nWell into the 1970s, it was still common for news, current affairs, sports coverage, game shows, talk/panel shows, 'infotainment' programs and variety shows to be broadcast live, and these were usually not recorded. In this early period, recording and editing TV shows on videotape was expensive and time-consuming, and because of the comparatively lower cost, and the high level of skill available to Australian TV networks in live broadcasting, and the lack of any market for such recordings, pre-recording or archiving of most day-to-day TV content was considered unnecessary and uneconomical. Although some news and other programming from this period has survived, most of what is still extant is material that was captured on film (such as actuality footage, interviews, press conferences, etc., recorded for news stories).\n\nAnother factor, common to all countries, was that before domestic video technology was introduced in the 1970s, there was generally no economic motive for Australian TV to make or keep recordings of most TV shows, except in the case of pre-produced 'mainstream' documentary, comedy or drama programs that could be sold to other stations in Australia, or to broadcasters in other countries (e.g. ''[[Skippy The Bush Kangaroo]]''). Likewise, virtually no private recordings exist of Australian TV material produced before domestic video was introduced, because viewers simply had no practical means to record programs off-air.\n\nBefore reliable, high-quality inter-city cable and satellite links were established, some Australian programs of the 1960s were routinely videotaped, usually for distribution to affiliate stations in other states \u2013 like the popular ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' with [[Graham Kennedy]] \u2013 but the vast majority of these program tapes were later erased, or simply destroyed.\n\nEven after videotape was well-established in Australian TV production, the practice of erasing and reusing tapes was common in both commercial TV and the ABC, and this continued well into the 1970s. Only a very small portion surviving of the many thousands of hours of videotaped programming made during the 1960s and early 1970s survives. The majority of ABC-TV's mainstream 'original' content (including comedy, drama, variety, news and current affairs) was produced 'in-house'; consequently these programs all suffered considerable losses due to the Corporation's policy of 'recycling' videotape \u2013 a practice further exacerbated by budget cuts in the 1970s. In one notorious case, a controversial installment of the 1970s ABC comedy series ''[[The Off Show]]'' (the infamous \"Leave It To Jesus\" episode) was lost because the show's producer vehemently objected to its religious satire, and deliberately erased the master tape the night before it was due to be broadcast.\n\nNotable losses include:\n\n* most of the 1969\u20131971 episodes of the ABC's weekly current affairs discussion show ''[[Monday Conference (TV show)|Monday Conference]]'';\n* ''[[This Day Tonight]]'' (ABC TV's groundbreaking nightly current affairs show) \u2013 most of the in-studio segments and other pre-recorded video segments were later wiped, although a small proportion of recorded reports survive because it was still common at the time (late 1960s-early 1970s) that location footage for feature stories was shot and edited on film before transfer to video for broadcast, so some of these film sources have survived.\n* the vast majority of episodes the numerous Australian TV pop shows that flourished in the 1960s and early 1970s (many of which emanated from Channel 0 in Melbourne) including ''[[The Go!! Show]], ''[[Kommotion]]'', [[Uptight (TV show)|Uptight]]'' and the'' 'Happening 70 / 71 / 72' series''\n* many episodes of the pioneering [[Australia]]n [[prime time]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', despite the fact that it was independently produced in-house for the 0\u201310 Network.\n\nAll the episodes from the first 12 months' (1969\u20131970) of the ABC's music magazine series ''[[GTK]]'' are now lost. The majority of the material recorded for the post-1970 episodes was rediscovered in ABC archives and storerooms in the early 2000s, when the ABC closed and sold off its [[Gore Hill, Sydney]] studio complex. This due to most of ''GTK'' program segments being recorded on film (in an older part of the studio complex) and then transferred to video for broadcast. Although many broadcast masters were wiped, many more were rescued and hidden by the program's later producer, Bernie Cannon, and nearly all the post-1970 filmed segments, including the archive of live-in-studio performances by local bands, have survived.\n\nOther shows suddenly missing from the archives include most of the first three years' of ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' (episodes beyond 1978 of ''Countdown'' have survived in this manner), nearly all of the hundreds of 15-minute episodes of the ABC's popular soap ''[[Bellbird (TV series)|Bellbird]]'', two thirds of all the taped 166 episodes from the ABC's ''[[Certain Women (television series)|Certain Women]]'', and a large proportion of the Ten Network's hugely popular ''[[Young Talent Time]]'' from the 1971\u20131976 era. Much of the early years of Nine's then-Saturday Morning children's program ''[[Hey Hey it's Saturday]]'' was unrecorded, and many episodes recorded in the early 1970s have since been erased.\n\nSome programs or segments of programs from the mid 1970s onwards have been retrieved from people's [[home taping]] shows off-air (portions of ''Young Talent Time'' and ''Countdown'' have survived in this manner).\n\nNo footage is known to exist of the Melbourne version of ''Tell the Truth''.<ref>http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=1;parentid=;query=tell%20the%20truth%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;rec=6;resCount=10</ref>\n\nGeneral lack of repeats of 1950s and 1960s Australian series makes it difficult to know what is extant and what is lost. For example, there is no information available as whether any episodes still exist of ''[[Take That (TV series)|Take That]]'' (1957\u20131959), sometimes considered to the first Australian television sitcom. Information on archival status is also lacking for other 1950s-era series like ''[[The Isador Goodman Show]]'' (1956\u20131957), ''[[It Pays to Be Funny]]'' (1957\u20131958), ''[[Sweet and Low (TV series)|Sweet and Low]]'' (1959), among others.\n\nSome of the best-known 'survivors' of this period are comedy or drama series commissioned and broadcast by the ABC's commercial rivals. Frequently, these were outsourced productions made by private companies, such as ''[[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo|Skippy]]'', and most notably the many drama series made by Melbourne-based [[Crawford Productions]] (a production brand of [[WIN Television]]), which at its peak in the 1970s had major primetime series running concurrently on all three Australian commercial networks. Crawfords retained the rights to its productions, and was able to earn money from reruns, so most of its production output was preserved. Crawford is now unique in Australian TV history because it still owns and markets a comprehensive archive of all its major productions from the 1960s and beyond, including ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'', ''[[Division 4]]'', ''[[Matlock Police]]'', and ''[[The Sullivans]]''.\n\nThe [[National Film and Sound Archive]] holdings of 1950s era shows include several episodes of the 1957 discussion series ''[[Leave It to the Girls (Australian TV series)|Leave it to the Girls]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22leave+it+to+the+girls%22+Media:%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10|title=NFSA \u2013 Search Results|website=colsearch.nfsa.gov.au}}</ref> most of the 1958\u20131959 soap opera ''[[Autumn Affair]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22autumn+affair%22+Media:%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10|title=NFSA \u2013 Search Results|website=colsearch.nfsa.gov.au}}</ref> and a number of episodes of the comedy game show ''[[The Pressure Pak Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22pressure+pak+show%22+Years:%3E=1957+Years:%3C=1959+Media:%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10|title=NFSA \u2013 Search Results|website=colsearch.nfsa.gov.au}}</ref> These shows, produced by ATN-7 in Sydney, probably survive because they were pre-recorded for the purpose of interstate broadcast (''Autumn Affair'', despite primitive production values, was repeated into the 1960s).\n\n===Belgium===\n* Only 9 of the 185 episodes of the Flemish sitcom ''[[Schipper naast Mathilde]]'' from 1955\u20131963 survive.\n* Most Flemish youth series from the 1950s were not preserved: ''Bolletje en Bonestaak'' (1955), ''Jan zonder Vrees'' (''[[John the Fearless]]'', 1956), ''Schatteneiland'' (''[[Treasure Island]]'', 1957), ''Reis om de wereld in 80 dagen'' (''[[Around the World in Eighty Days|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', 1957), and ''Professor Kwit'' (1958).

The ninth edition of 1964 is said to have been recorded on tape, but a fire reportedly destroyed the copy at [[Danmarks Radio|DR]], the broadcaster who produced the contest. Another recording of the contest, however, does exist at the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|French television archives]], but is not yet available to view online.<ref>http://inatheque.ina.fr/doc/TV-RADIO/DA_CPF96003532/9eme-concours-eurovision-de-la-chanson-1964?rang=21</ref> Only small portions of the original broadcast and audio from the radio transmission are viewable for the time being.\n\n===Ireland===\n\n*The [[Republic of Ireland]] was a latecomer to television, [[Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] being established in 1962. Although early news broadcasts were recorded on [[kinescope]]s, almost all broadcasts from the first fifteen years (i.e. up to 1977) are lost. Of the soap opera ''[[Tolka Row]]'' (1964\u201368) only the last episode survives, while almost all the early episodes of ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' (1962\u2013present) are lost. Even when shows were sent abroad \u2014 ''[[The Riordans]]'' was sent to Australia for rebroadcast \u2014 the tapes were often sent back to Ireland and recorded over, as they were so expensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcu.ie/~sheehanh/60s-itvd.htm|title=Irish television drama in the 1960s|first=Dr Helena|last=Sheehan|website=www.dcu.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Linehan|first1=Hugh|title=RT\u00c9 archive a treasure trove of faces, voices and memories|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/rt%C3%A9-archive-a-treasure-trove-of-faces-voices-and-memories-1.2665155|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=May 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\n* The 23rd, 24th and 25th editions of the Italian [[Sanremo Festival]] of 1973, 1974 and 1975 have been lost in Italian Public Broadcasting archives and never recovered. Only some portions of the original tapes have survived in the Daily News Archives. The whole 17th edition of 1967 is missing as well, supposedly handed to the public authorities because of the investigation of [[Luigi Tenco]]'s suicide. The 26th edition of 1976 was lost by [[RAI]] but it could be recovered in the [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|Spanish Broadcasting Company]]'s (TVE) vaults, since it was broadcast all around Europe and recorded by TVE.\n\n===Japan===\n* 31 segments of the original 1973 ''[[Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon]]'' are lost due to the studio warehouse that stored all content of the show, having to sell the reels off for money, which ultimately failed in the end. The show only lasted for 26 episodes\u2014it was interrupted due to the dissolution of Nippon TV Video, the production studio. 21 episodes are known to survive, two of which have no audio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-strange-case-of-the-1973-doraemon-series/|title=The Strange Case of the 1973 \"Doraemon\" Series {{!}} Cartoon Research|website=cartoonresearch.com|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref> The final episode was called \"Sayonara Doraemon\" (Goodbye Doraemon) and aired on September 30, 1973. Audio, still images, the opening theme and ending theme survive all together. In 1995, 16 episodes were found to be stored in Studio Rush (now known as IMAGICA), and other segments have been found, though two remain without their audio tracks. The opening and ending credits do still exist as well, along with a pilot film that was produced in 1972. These are occasionally shown at ''[[Doraemon]]'' fan conventions in Japan, but cannot be released legally on DVD owing to rights complications due to the production studio being defunct. According to the Japanese Wikipedia, with the dissolution of [[Nippon TV]] Video, the film reels to the series and other possessions wound up sold off to cover debt, while other belongings in the studio and production materials were either thrown out in the garbage or destroyed in a kerosene fire. Also it was briefly rebroadcast in 1979, but was abruptly pulled off television by order of Shogakukan, who did not want the [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|new adaptation]]'s reputation to be affected by the existence of the previous one, or for child viewers to be confused at the two different versions, so theories that a fire in the warehouse happened accidentally burnt down footage and it was never broadcast again are false.\n* All the episodes of the first ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]'' anime first broadcast in 1966 were believed to be lost sometime after the 1970s reruns ended until said material was found in 1990 in storage at the Senrioka studio of Mainichi Broadcasting.\n* The entirety of the [[Toho]] tokusatsu television series ''[[Assault! Human!!]]'', originally produced and aired in 1972, was lost at some point after the series was rebroadcast in the 1980's, after Nippon TV accidentally overwrote the master tapes. While suits from the show were reused by Toho in ''[[Go! Godman]]'' and ''[[Go! Greenman]]'', the only traces of ''Assault Human!'' come in the form of supplementary materials such as reference books, merchandise, magazine articles and the show's soundtrack; in addition, a fragment of footage roughly 1 minute long was uncovered in the mid-2010s, having been transferred from a [[Betamax]] tape.\n* All episodes of the [[Osamu Tezuka|Tezuka]] anime ''[[Big X]]'' are said to be lost except for episodes 1, 11, and 40\u201359.\n* Only episodes 37 and 38 of ''Space Alien Pipi'' survive, along with the opening and ending theme.\n* Certain episodes of ''[[Perman]]'' are lost, some have picture but no audio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/lost-tv-anime/|title=Lost TV Anime {{!}} Cartoon Research|website=cartoonresearch.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\n* The most famous missing programs are the children's shows ''Ja zuster nee zuster'' from the 1960s and most of [[Hamelen (TV series)|''Hamelin'' (''Kunt u mij de weg naar Hamelen vertellen'')]] from the 1970s. \n* 1970s-era Dutch series ''The Eddy-Go-Round Show'' hosted by Eddy Becker, despite featuring high-profile guests, is reported to have been largely erased by the broadcaster it aired on,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbaontv.com/1975/description-eddy-go-round.html|title=ABBA on TV \u2013 The Eddy Go Round Show|website=www.abbaontv.com}}</ref> though a short section featuring Swedish pop group [[ABBA]] performing \"[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]\" was later uncovered on a tape recorded by a home viewer. An additional episode was later uncovered as the host had kept a copy himself, and was later re-broadcast on a Dutch cable channel in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbaontv.com/1975/description-eddy-becker-show.html|title=ABBA on TV \u2013 The Eddy Go Round Show|website=www.abbaontv.com}}</ref> A clip of [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]] performing on the show also has survived.\n*A further clip of [[Olivia Newton-John]] performing was found by Ray Langstone in 2013.\n\n===Philippines===\n* The first three years (1979 to 1982) of the longest-running television show in the Philippines, ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'', have been lost. The first full surviving episode was broadcast on August 7, 1982, the third anniversary of the show.\n* The inaugural game of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) in 1975, along with most of the games that were broadcast during the first seven seasons of the league, are believed to be lost. The oldest known full game archive of the league was from the 1979 season. Most of the league's playoffs games, including a significant number of games involving Ginebra, were missing in the PBA archives, when the archive was digitized in 2010. Short clips of older games are in possession of private collectors.\n* The television archive of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] from 1953 to 1972 are believed lost, when the station was taken over by the government of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] when he declared martial law in the country. (In addition, ABS-CBN alleged in its complaint-affidavit filed after the [[People Power Revolution]] against Roberto Benedicto (who took over ABS-CBN's facilities following the declaration of martial law) that \"the musical records and radio dramas accumulated by ABS-CBN in a span of twenty-five (25) years and stored in its library were now gone\".)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/october2008/133347.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104054054/http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/october2008/133347.htm |archive-date=2014-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* The status of the archived broadcasts of [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]], the television network that took over ABS-CBN's facilities from 1973 to 1986 is unknown.\n\n===Spain===\n* Hundreds of episodes from the internationally versioned show ''[[Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez]]'', mainly from the first two seasons (1972\u20131973 and 1976\u20131978), including the first episode of the first season, are lost or were destroyed. Only four episodes out of 54 from the first season and 12 out of 83 from the second season are known to survive. The following seasons from the third to the fifth one (1982\u20131986) are also incomplete, but not as dramatically diminished as the previous seasons. The sixth season of 1987 is the first fully located and preserved one. Since Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola archives were not catalogued until 1987, and there are thousands of tapes in kilometers of shelves of unknown uncatalogued content, there could be more episodes there than what is preserved today (the last previously thought lost then found episode from the first season was just discovered in 2005). Also, some of the lost episodes of seasons two, three, four and five exist as either complete or as portions on the archives or on home video recordings by viewers of the show.\n\n===Greece===\n* The vast majority of Greek television shows before the 1980s are considered lost, as [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] never took archiving seriously. Recent efforts have been made to archive what is left, but the material is very limited.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main article|List of lost television broadcasts in the United Kingdom}}\n* Early [[BBC]]-created programmes from the 1930s and 1940s such as ''[[Telecrimes]]'', ''[[Pinwright's Progress]]'', ''[[The Disorderly Room]]'', ''[[Sports Review]]'', ''[[Theatre Parade]]'', and the play ''[[Wasp's Nest (Theatre Parade)|Wasp's Nest]]'', were usually shown live and not recorded. The only visual evidence of these programmes today consists of still photographs.\n* All recordings of the early televised [[Francis Durbridge]] serials from 1952 to 1959 were completely destroyed, and the first two (''[[Broken Horseshoe]]'' and ''[[Operation Diplomat (TV series)|Operation Diplomat]]'') were never recorded.\n* Only one episode survived from the 1961 TV Series ''Call Oxbridge 2000''.\n* Four of the six episodes of ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'', Britain's first [[science fiction]] television programme aimed at an adult audience, were never recorded; the two existing episodes are the oldest [[BBC]] recordings of any fictional series today.\n* ''[[The Madhouse on Castle Street]]'', a 1963 [[BBC]] teleplay starring a then-unknown [[Bob Dylan]], is considered lost. It was erased in 1968, and despite attempts by the [[British Film Institute]] to recover it, a telerecorded copy has still not been found {{as of|2009|lc=on}}.\n*In autumn 1967, ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' had made such impact on viewers of the show that the producers of [[Associated Television|ATV]]'s Saturday evening live game show ''[[The Golden Shot]]'' decided for their Christmas special to dedicate the show to ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons''. The show was presented by [[Bob Monkhouse]]. ''The Golden Shot'' consisted of a number of shooting games where viewers using their telephone directed a blindfolded marksman to fire his crossbow at illuminated apples attached to illustrated backgrounds. For the Captain Scarlet edition, the target board featured individual painted scenes from the TV series ''The Mysterons Complex'', ''Angel Interceptors'', ''Spectrum Helicopter and the Angel Interceptors'', Spectrum Helicopter and the Angels exiting the Amber Room on their injector seats. Captain Scarlet was the star guest (designated Golden Partner) the puppet of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] sat at [[Colonel White]]'s desk whilst [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]] supplied the voice off- camera. A musical performance was supplied by \"The Spectrum\" who sang their latest hit song \"Headin for a Heatwave\" and the hosts Anne Aston and Carol Dilworth wore Angel Uniforms. The show was originally broadcast live on Saturday 23 December 1967, [[Associated Television|ATV]] London region at 8:35pm. It was then shown the next day at 1:05pm on [[Associated Television|ATV]] Midlands region. Since these airings all the archive footage of this show has been wiped.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bentley |first= Chris |coauthors= |title= The Complete Book of \"Captain Scarlet\" |publisher= Carlton Books Ltd |date=August 2001 |isbn= 1-84222-405-0}}</ref>\n* Many early music programmes, such as ''[[Ready Steady Go!|Ready Steady Go]]'' and (until the mid-1970s, most episodes of) ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' are lost, so many significant television appearances\u2014such as [[The Beatles]]' last live television performance in 1966, and most appearances of [[Pink Floyd]] with [[Syd Barrett]]\u2014are unavailable.\n* 97 black and white episodes of the [[BBC]] sci-fi show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', all from the tenures of [[William Hartnell]] and [[Patrick Troughton]] (the first two [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctors]]), do not exist in the BBC's archives (see [[Doctor Who missing episodes|''Doctor Who'' missing episodes]]), though they have an ongoing appeal for help from viewers who may have recorded the shows during their original airings. Audio recordings exist for all of the lost episodes, however, all of which have been released commercially by the BBC. Several episodes of various serials, including ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'', ''[[The Reign of Terror (Doctor Who)|The Reign of Terror]]'', ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'', (all episodes that survive only in audio form) were reconstructed using animation for various DVD releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/missingepisodes.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The missing episodes.|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The BBC also holds many extant clips from the lost episodes ranging from such sources as an 8&nbsp;mm camera, censored clips physically cut from the episodes, insert shots, and clips shown on 1960s and 1970s programmes (most notably ''[[Blue Peter]]''). As recently as late 2013 (when the five previously missing episodes of ''[[The Enemy of the World]]'' and four of the five missing episodes of ''[[The Web of Fear]]'' were discovered) occasional lost episodes have continued to be discovered. The only episode thought to be permanently irrecoverable is \"The Feast of Steven\", from the 1965\u20131966 serial ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]''.\n* The BBC [[wiping|wiped]] many editions of ''[[Not Only... But Also]]'', starring [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]] from its archives in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as it did with many other programmes. Cook and Moore had even allegedly offered to pay for the cost of preservation and buy new videotapes so that the old tapes would not need to be reused, but this offer was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/notonlybutalso/index.shtml|title=BBC Comedy page on \"Not Only... But Also\"}}</ref> Some [[telerecording]]s of the black and white episodes survive, but all of the videotaped footage from the colour series was wiped, so that the only surviving colour sketches are on [[16mm film]] inserts.\n* Many other BBC shows are missing from the archives, including the BBC studio footage from the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] moon landings. Many series, such as football-themed soap opera ''[[United!]]'', are missing in their entirety, while others only survive in fragments such as ''[[A for Andromeda]]'', a science fiction series that was [[Julie Christie]]'s first major role. \n* [[Dad's Army missing episodes|Three episodes]] from the second series of ''[[Dad's Army]]'' are missing as are almost half of the editions of ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''. Almost all editions of ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' are missing as are more than half of the episodes of ''[[Z-Cars]]''.\n* Most of the archives of two [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractors [[Associated British Corporation]] (ABC) and [[Associated-Rediffusion]] were destroyed in the 1970s after they were merged to become [[Thames Television]]. Associated-Rediffusion's archive suffered considerably more damage than [[Associated British Corporation]]'s, leaving little of ''[[No Hiding Place]]'', ''[[The Rat Catchers]]'', and other programmes. Almost all of the entire first series of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was erased shortly after transmission.\n* The original black-and-white recording of the premiere episode of the British series ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'' (1970\u20131975) does not exist in any form with the possible exception of a few stills and the location footage which features at the start of the shot-in-color rerecording of the premiere episode. The original recording took place on November 13, 1970, and was in monochrome owing to a dispute with studio technicians, who refused to work with colour recording equipment as part of a work to rule. The following five episodes were also recorded in monochrome before the dispute ended with the recording of episode 6 in color on February 12, 1971. After the entire thirteen-episode season run had been recorded, it was decided to rerecord the first episode in color to gain the highest possible audience for its first UK transmission and to help with overseas sales. The rerecording took place on May 21, 1971, and the series' UK debut was on October 10, 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.updown.org.uk/epguide/s1.htm|title=Upstairs, Downstairs \u2013 Season One|website=www.updown.org.uk}}</ref> The original monochrome recording was never transmitted and was wiped. All of the other five black-and-white episodes from series One survive.\n* Most editions of the controversial and anarchic British children's Saturday morning television series ''[[Tiswas]]'' were transmitted live without any official recording and many of the original master tapes of such editions as did get recorded by the broadcaster were wiped or left to deteriorate after the series was canceled in 1982. When a series of ''Tiswas'' highlight compilation tapes was released on video in the early 1990s (followed in 2006 by a DVD), much of the footage appeared to have been culled from the off-air recordings of private archivists.\n* ''Black Limelight'' is a stage play which was adapted for British television three times, with each version being lost. These include a 1952 version as part of ''[[Sunday Night Theatre]]'', which was broadcast live and never recorded,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=75b99d8f-48c9-40a9-8cd4-7a3e123b54d1|title=TVBrain \u2013 Kaleidoscope \u2013 Lost shows \u2013 TV Archive \u2013 TV History|website=www.lostshows.com}}</ref> a 1956 version as part of ''[[Armchair Theatre]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=7155cd25-2194-4007-b263-7c135cec5347|title=TVBrain \u2013 Kaleidoscope \u2013 Lost shows \u2013 TV Archive \u2013 TV History|website=www.lostshows.com}}</ref> and a 1962 version as part of ''[[BBC Sunday-Night Play]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=d9b43ef8-6c3c-47be-9834-4c9368639edc|title=TVBrain \u2013 Kaleidoscope \u2013 Lost shows \u2013 TV Archive \u2013 TV History|website=www.lostshows.com}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n* Most of the earliest American [[mechanical television]] programs of the early 1930s, including ''[[The Television Ghost]]'', ''[[Piano Lessons (TV series)|Piano Lessons]]'' and variety shows by [[Helen Haynes]] and [[Harriet Lee (TV series)|Harriet Lee]], are considered lost, as no methods existed to preserve them. Only promotional pictures of the shows still exist.<ref>Hawes, William, American Television Drama: The Experimental Years (University of Alabama Press, 1986)</ref>\n* Almost no audio or film material of any television shows from prior to 1948 exist. One of the few exceptions was ''[[Hour Glass (TV series)|Hour Glass]]'', an early variety show that ran from 1946 to 1947 and was preserved in the form of audio and, in the case of one episode, still pictures.\n* The debut broadcast of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called ''Toast of the Town'') from June 20, 1948, is considered lost. The episode featured what is almost certainly the first television appearance of the [[Martin and Lewis|comedy act]] of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n* Nearly the entire film archive of the [[DuMont Television Network]] (1946\u20131956), consisting of approximately 175 television series, are missing, presumed destroyed. From the ten years of this network, only about 100 kinescope and originally film episodes of DuMont series survive at the [[Library of Congress]], [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], the [[Paley Center for Media]] in New York, Chicago's [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]], on [[YouTube]] or [[Internet Archive]], or in private collections. In 1996, early television actress [[Edie Adams]] testified at a hearing in front of a panel of the [[Library of Congress]] on the preservation of American television and video, that little value was given to the DuMont film archive by the 1970s, and that all the remaining kinescoped episodes of DuMont series were loaded into three trucks and dumped into [[Upper New York Bay]].<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Edie |authorlink=Edie Adams |title=Television/Video Preservation Study: Los Angeles Public Hearing |work=National Film Preservation Board |publisher=Library of Congress |date=March 1996 |url=https://www.loc.gov/film/hrng96la.html |accessdate=2008-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072638/http://www.loc.gov/film/hrng96la.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> See [[List of surviving DuMont Television Network broadcasts]] for more info.\n* The ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' television program, broadcast in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and other local areas, which featured the first television appearance of [[Elvis Presley]]. Only an audio recording taken from the acetate disc of Presley's complete performance, singing \"Tweedlee Dee\", \"Money Honey\", \"Hearts of Stone\", \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", \"That's All Right\" and \"You're a Heartbreaker\" on the program, has survived. Original broadcast date was March 5, 1955.\n* None of the episodes of the 1954\u201355 series ''[[The Vampira Show]]'', the first television horror movie show, were ever preserved. One film, containing a recreation of an episode that was made for a promotional reel for the station that aired the show, survives.\n* The 1957 syndicated cartoon ''[[Colonel Bleep]]'' has approximately half of its episodes still missing. The entire master archive was stolen in the early 1970s, never to be found, and the current collection is taken from the various tapes sent out to individual stations, approximately half of which have been found.\n* The 1957 CBS production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'' starring [[Julie Andrews]] was believed to be lost for years. It was rediscovered in the late 1990s, but only in black-and-white kinescope; the original color broadcast has been lost. The kinescope has since been released on DVD.\n* Almost all of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jack Paar]] and the first ten years (1962\u20131972) hosted by [[Johnny Carson]] were taped over by the network and no longer exist. The videotape was being used repeatedly, hence the reason that Carson's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' picture looked muddy during broadcast in the late 1960s. Selected sequences from the 1962\u20131972 era survive and were often replayed by Carson himself (particularly in the months preceding his retirement in 1992) and have been released to home video; some audiotapes and still pictures of those years also exist. Some Paar episodes also survive and have also been released to home video (in this case, DVD).\n* Similarly, NBC reused the tapes of ventriloquist [[Shari Lewis]]'s 1960\u20131963 Saturday morning children's program ''[[The Shari Lewis Show]]'', to record coverage of the 1964 [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] [[United States presidential nominating convention|National Convention]]s. Lewis said in an interview decades later that to her, this was a shame, since the shows were beautifully done as a showcase of NBC's early color broadcast work.\n* As of 2011, 1968's [[Super Bowl II]] is the only [[Super Bowl]] without any surviving telecast recording. A nearly complete color tape of [[Super Bowl I]] was discovered in 2005, but kept secret for nearly five years; portions of telecasts up through [[Super Bowl V]] are either missing or only exist in black-and-white. [[NFL Films]], the league's official filmmaker, produced their own copies (at a higher quality than a live television broadcast could produce at the time) of the games for posterity.\n* [[videocassette recorder|Home VCRs]], first introduced in November 1975, were still uncommon until the early 1980s. It is unlikely that lost television episodes exist in the collections of individuals, though this occasionally happens. Home audio recordings, however, were relatively common at the time, and audio recordings of these episodes are somewhat more common. One well-known example of an early home video recording being the only surviving footage of an event is a clip of [[John Lennon]] visiting the announcers' booth during a 1974 ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] lost the footage of this event, but a private collector's copy appears in the ''[[Beatles Anthology]]''. Similarly, home [[kinescope]]s of [[World Football League]] recorded as game film serve as the only surviving copies of several games in that league's short history.\n* Another such example occurred with the Sergio Leone film ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''. When it was originally broadcast in the United States in 1975, an alternate opening was shot to meet the standards and practices guidelines of the network. This opening was subsequently lost by the network, but had been taped by a fan of the film and was placed on the special edition DVD.\n* The first live sporting event broadcast by [[ESPN]] was the first game of the 1979 Softball World Series in men's professional slow-pitch softball. Roughly 20 years later, the manager of the Kentucky Bourbons, losers in the series, contacted ESPN about acquiring a copy of that game, and was told that this was the only lost broadcast in the network's history. However, it was later found that the owner of the series-winning Milwaukee Schlitz had previously purchased a copy of this broadcast, and still had the tapes in his possession. The tapes were produced and eventually became the centerpiece of an ''[[E:60]]'' episode that aired as part of the network's 40th anniversary celebration in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdrb.com/news/kentucky-bourbons-players-reunite-to-commemorate-special-moment-in-espn/article_d6d3db5a-f430-11e9-a7cf-6732530f6d4c.html |title=Kentucky Bourbons players reunite to commemorate special moment in ESPN history |first=Scott |last=Reynolds |publisher=[[WDRB]] |location=Louisville, KY |date=October 21, 2019 |accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* Most US daytime soap opera episodes broadcast before 1978 have been lost. The status of episodes, however, varies widely from show to show:\n** Soaps produced by [[Procter & Gamble|Procter & Gamble Productions]], including ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', and ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' began preserving their episodes in 1978. A few scattered episodes, mostly black and white kinescopes, of these series exist from the 1950s, 1960s, and early to mid-1970s. The CBS soaps ''[[Love of Life]]'' and ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', as well as several short-lived shows, suffered the same fate.\n** ABC's ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]'' were originally owned by their creator, [[Agnes Nixon]], who chose to archive all episodes. However, early episodes of ''AMC'' were only saved as black-and-white kinescopes despite being produced and telecast in color. ABC purchased the shows in late 1974; different sources report that Nixon's archive was either lost in a fire or erased. A few black-and-white kinescopes of both series' early years exist, as well as a few color episodes. ABC began full archiving of these soaps at Nixon's insistence when they expanded from 30 minutes to an hour\u2014''AMC'' in 1977, and ''OLTL'' in 1978.\n** Most 1963\u20131970 episodes of ABC's longest-running ''[[General Hospital]]'' survive because the series was then owned by Selmur Productions. Few episodes from 1970 to 1977 were saved. ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' premiered in 1975, several years before ABC began saving all of its daytime programming, but exists in its entirety as it was originally owned by Labine-Mayer Productions.\n**''[[Dark Shadows]]'', created by Dan Curtis, which ran from 1966 to 1971, has the distinction of being one of the few soap operas to have nearly all of its original episodes preserved. As a result of kinescope, many earlier episodes of which the master film was lost are still available. However, episode #1219 was lost but reconstructed with an audio recording for home video release.\n** Two long-running soaps have full archives: ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', which premiered in 1965, and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', which premiered in 1973. Both series were originally distributed by [[Screen Gems]].\n* The original [[slow-scan TV]] footage of the [[Apollo 11|first manned moon landing]] in 1969, believed to be of significantly higher quality than the standards-converted version broadcast on TV, is missing from [[NASA]]'s archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/apollo11_sstv_search_report.html|title=The Search for the Apollo 11 SSTV Tapes \u2013 21 May 2006|website=www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013002065.html|title=The Saga Of the Lost Space Tapes|first=Marc|last=Kaufman|date=31 January 2007|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> This, among other things, has led to many [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the landings]], though both NASA and non-NASA authorities have repeatedly debunked any claims of foul play. See [[Apollo 11 missing tapes]].\n* Almost all daytime [[game show]]s from the 1970s and before have been destroyed. [[CBS]]'s archives begin in 1972, ABC's in 1978, and NBC's in 1980. A handful of producers (most notably [[Mark Goodson|Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman|Todman]]) did arrange for the preservation of their shows even during the tape-recycling period.\n** The original ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' (NBC, 1964\u20131975) has less than 1% of its episodes (24 out of 2,753) still in existence.\n** Approx. 130 episodes of ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' (NBC, 1966\u20131981) were broadcast on [[Game Show Network]], mostly the 1968 NBC nighttime version and 1971\u20131976 syndicated episodes; NBC allegedly destroyed the remainder when it was announced that GSN acquired the rights to the ''Squares'' episodes.\n** ''[[Snap Judgment (game show)|Snap Judgment]]'' (NBC, 1967\u20131969) is completely destroyed (a rarity for a Goodson-Todman produced show) with only one episode existing on audio tape.\n** ''[[The Big Showdown]]'' (ABC, 1974\u20131975) has only two full episodes surviving, namely the 1974 pilot and episode #67, which aired in March 1975. A video clip of another bonus round exists, along with an ABC promo and an undated audio clip of an opening. An audio recording of the July 4, 1975 finale exists and circulates among collectors.\n** ''[[Second Chance (game show)|Second Chance]]'' (ABC, 1977), once thought completely lost other than a pilot episode, has three known episodes surviving, with one (the series finale) only existing on audiotape.\n** ''[[High Rollers]]'' (NBC and syndication, 1974\u20131976 and 1978\u20131980) has only twelve episodes remaining: two from the first run and ten from the second, including the finale.\n** ''[[Winning Streak (US game show)|Winning Streak]]'' (NBC, 1974\u20131975) has only two episodes remaining (one is noteworthy in that it was intended to air August 9, 1974, but was preempted due to coverage of [[Nixon resignation|Richard Nixon's resignation]] and [[inauguration of Gerald Ford]]), plus the opening portion of a third.\n** ''[[Eye Guess]]'' (NBC, 1966\u20131969) has only one and a half episodes remaining.\n** The second version of ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]'' (NBC, 1983\u20131984) has only a handful of episodes remaining; the show's master tapes were accidentally destroyed by a flood in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TVPMM/posts/688309631183817|title=Facebook post by TVPMM|website=Facebook|publisher=Museum of Television Production Music|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=27 July 2013|quote=Just confirmed that all 395 episodes from 1983/84 Dream House videotape masters were destroyed in a flood with production materials/music.}}</ref>\n** The nighttime version of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' (syndication, 1972\u20131980) has not been destroyed, but has remained within the confines of the CBS/FremantleMedia archives since their original airings due to a dispute with former executive producer and host [[Bob Barker]]. Barker requested that the episodes in question be withheld due to his position against the offering of animal-made prizes, such as fur coats. Episodes which featured these prizes before Bob prohibited them have been blocked from circulation. This includes the entire hosting span of [[Dennis James]], who hosted from 1972 to 1977. According to former ''Price'' staff member Scott Robinson, who discovered the documentation for the nighttime version among the program's archives during his tenure at the show, of the 301 episodes recorded, there were no more than five that did ''not'' have a fur coat. Additionally, the first taped episode (001N) is not in the archives.\n*** James personally recorded nearly all of Seasons 1\u20133, along with scattered episodes of Seasons 4\u20135, at his home from KNBC's airings (James preserved a great deal of his own work as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 supplement); however, the former set of broadcasts were taped onto [[Cartrivision]] [[V-Cord]] and [[VX (videocassette format)|VX]], recording media that is now obscure. Approximately six full-length episodes (two from 1972, one each from 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977) with James hosting and one from Barker's tenure (the final show, from 1980) circulate as master copies, and home audio recordings from about 30 others from 1973 to 1975 (spanning the second, third, and early fourth seasons) also circulate.\n** The first daytime version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (NBC, 1975\u20131989) is destroyed through at least 1979, with a King World representative stating in August 2006 that creator [[Merv Griffin]]'s production company continued reusing tapes into 1985. GSN holds all episodes after the cutoff point, airing three (from 1976, 1982, and 1989) following Griffin's death in 2007. Despite not being among the three, clips of a March 1978 episode were used for a c.-2004 ''Total Living'' interview with original host [[Chuck Woolery]], using a then-current (for the interview) GSN logo. Fans have since hypothesized that GSN made or received copies from the [[Paley Center for Media]], which holds all four episodes in question.\n**The 1989 version of ''[[Now You See It (American game show)#1989|Now You See It]]'' has not been destroyed, but has been withheld from circulation since its original run at the request of host [[Chuck Henry]].\n**All episodes of the [[Jay Wolpert]]-produced game shows ''[[Whew!]]'' (CBS, 1979\u20131980) and ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' (CBS, 1988) are intact, but both shows have not been rerun since their cancellation.\n* The joint Japanese and English masters for the original 1960s version of ''[[Tetsuwan Atom]]''/''[[Astro Boy]]'' were destroyed in 1975 by NBC after the syndication of the series ended and Tezuka Productions, which was undergoing bankruptcy at the time refused them for lack of funds to receive them. When [[The Right Stuf]] gained the license for the series, they were forced to find broadcast copies of the show and mate them with English sound masters that were still extant.\n* A number of episodes of the early-1960s sitcom ''[[My Living Doll]]'' are either lost or only survive in poor condition. The 2011 DVD release of the first half of the season includes an on-screen plea to anyone who might have prints of the missing episodes.\n* Most of the 1980s talk show ''[[Hot Seat (talk show)|Hot Seat]] with [[Wally George]]'' broadcast before the show going into syndication were destroyed; the producing station ([[KDOC-TV]] in the Orange County, California area) could not afford to archive the show. Many episodes that were nationally syndicated do exist.\n* Sixty episodes of the long-running ''[[Sesame Street]]'' do not exist in the archives of [[Sesame Workshop]]. This list of lost episodes includes the debut of long-running cast member [[Linda (Sesame Street)|Linda]] and [[Oscar the Grouch|Oscar the Grouch's]] pet worm, [[Slimey the Worm|Slimey]].\n* ''[[The Paul Winchell Show]]'', also known as ''The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show'' was a children's show hosted by ventriloquist and voice actor [[Paul Winchell]] on [[Metromedia|Metromedia Television's]] [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]]. All of the episodes are said to have been lost after station management vindictively erased tapes in 1970 in retaliation after Winchell refused Metromedia's syndication deal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grassiniandwrinkle.com/pdfs/press_winchell.pdf|title=Ventriloquist wins $17.8 million award in Metromedia suit|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eejlaw.com/materials/April_Enterprises_v_KTTV_E08_ed.pdf|title=April Enterprises Inc. v.

Early broadcasting in all genres was live and sometimes performed repeatedly. Due to there being no means to record the broadcast, or because the content itself was thought to have little monetary or historical value it wasn't deemed necessary to save it. In the [[United Kingdom]], much early programming was lost due to contractual demands by the actors' union to limit the rescreening of recorded performances.\n\nApart from [[Phonovision]] experiments by [[John Logie Baird]], and some 280 rolls of 35mm film containing a number of [[Paul Nipkow television station]] broadcasts, no recordings of transmissions from 1939 or earlier are known to exist.\n\nIn 1947, [[Kinescope]] films became a viable method of recording broadcasts, but programs were only sporadically filmed or preserved. [[Tele-snaps]] of British television broadcasts also began in 1947 but are necessarily incomplete. Magnetic [[videotape]] technologies became a viable method to record and distribute material in 1956. Televised programming (especially that which was not considered viable for [[rerun]]s) was still considered disposable. What was recorded was routinely destroyed by [[wiping]] and reusing the tapes until the rise of the [[Videocassette recorder#The late 1970s: mass-market success|home video industry]] in the 1970s.\n\nThe ability for home viewers to record programming was extremely limited; although a home viewer could record the video of a broadcast by [[kinescope]] recording onto [[8 mm film]] throughout television history or record the audio of a broadcast onto [[audiotape]] beginning in the 1950s, one could generally not capture both on the same medium until [[Super 8 mm film|super-8]] debuted in the 1960s. Attempting to film a television broadcast using the kinescope process required positioning the camera directly in front of the screen, blocking the view of other people trying to watch. This would have been very disruptive to the television viewing experience and as such home movies of this kind are exceptionally rare. Audio recordings, which do not require obstructing the view of the screen are more common and numerous copies of otherwise lost television broadcasts exist. The growing availability of home video recording from the late 1970s was also a benefit for television producers and archivers as video tape was now economical enough for a home viewer to afford and enabled television networks the ability to save much of their programming as well.\n\n==Significant lost broadcasts==\n\n===Australia===\n\nLike most other countries, only a small portion of the early decades of Australian TV programming has survived. Many economic, technical, social and regulatory forces combined to prevent large-scale preservation of Australian programs from this period, and also contributed to the later destruction of most of what was recorded at the time. There was, and is, no regulatory requirement to lodge copies of programs with an archive authority such as the [[National Library of Australia]]. \n\nIn the first decade of Australian TV, 1956\u20131966, Australia produced very little original local content, compared to most other English-speaking nations. From the introduction of TV in Australia in 1956 to around 1964, the vast majority of locally produced original programming was made by the government-funded [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]. By June 1964, the ABC had produced 185 of the 212 plays, all 31 operas, and 90 of the 95 ballets shown on Australian TV in that period.<ref>Stuart Cunningham et al., The Media and Communications in Australia (Allen & Unwin, 2001, {{ISBN|978-1-86508-674-3}}), p.175</ref> Some of this was recorded, but little of that material has survived. \n\nNearly all of the relatively small amount of original content produced by the two commercial networks operating in the same period (mainly consisting of news, sport, talk, game shows, and variety shows) was broadcast live, and was rarely recorded. One of the best-known and most often seen surviving recordings from this period is the footage that purports to be the recording of the inaugural broadcast of TCN-9 Sydney on 16 September 1956, but this is in fact a fabrication \u2013 the actual broadcast was not recorded at the time, so the station restaged it some days later, for archival and promotional purposes.\n\nIn this early period, the technology then available to pre-record television programs, or to record live broadcasts 'off-air', was relatively primitive. Although Australia introduced TV rather later (1956) than comparable nations like the UK and the USA, the use of videotape did not become widespread in the Australian industry until the early 1960s, so only a small number of episodes from the earliest period have survived. Nearly all of that material is in I[[kinescope]] format.\n\nAlthough many important ABC programs from these early days were captured as telecine recordings, most of this material was later lost or destroyed. In a 1999 newspaper article on the subject, author [[Bob Ellis]] recounted the story of a large collection of historic telecine recordings of early ABC drama productions, and other programs, including some of the first Australian TV Shakespeare productions, and the pioneering popular music show ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]''. Learning that the ABC planned to dispose of these recordings, [[Bruce Beresford]] (then a production assistant at the ABC), arranged for a friend to pose as a silver nitrate dealer, and the anonymous collector purchased the films for a nominal cost. Subsequently, the collector occasionally rented some of the films out to schools for a small fee, but unfortunately, the daughter of one of the actors involved ([[Owen Weingott]]) recognised her father from a Shakespeare production, and told him about it. Assuming that the ABC still owned the print and was making money out of these recordings without compensating the actors, Weingott lodged an official complaint. Commonwealth police descended on the illegal collector, but he was warned that they were coming, and in a panic he destroyed almost all the material he possessed.<ref>Bob Ellis, \"The Lost Picture Show\", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 February 1999</ref>\n\nWell into the 1970s, it was still common for news, current affairs, sports coverage, game shows, talk/panel shows, 'infotainment' programs and variety shows to be broadcast live, and these were usually not recorded. In this early period, recording and editing TV shows on videotape was expensive and time-consuming, and because of the comparatively lower cost, and the high level of skill available to Australian TV networks in live broadcasting, and the lack of any market for such recordings, pre-recording or archiving of most day-to-day TV content was considered unnecessary and uneconomical. Although some news and other programming from this period has survived, most of what is still extant is material that was captured on film (such as actuality footage, interviews, press conferences, etc., recorded for news stories).\n\nAnother factor, common to all countries, was that before domestic video technology was introduced in the 1970s, there was generally no economic motive for Australian TV to make or keep recordings of most TV shows, except in the case of pre-produced 'mainstream' documentary, comedy or drama programs that could be sold to other stations in Australia, or to broadcasters in other countries (e.g. ''[[Skippy The Bush Kangaroo]]''). Likewise, virtually no private recordings exist of Australian TV material produced before domestic video was introduced, because viewers simply had no practical means to record programs off-air.\n\nBefore reliable, high-quality inter-city cable and satellite links were established, some Australian programs of the 1960s were routinely videotaped, usually for distribution to affiliate stations in other states \u2013 like the popular ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' with [[Graham Kennedy]] \u2013 but the vast majority of these program tapes were later erased, or simply destroyed.\n\nEven after videotape was well-established in Australian TV production, the practice of erasing and reusing tapes was common in both commercial TV and the ABC, and this continued well into the 1970s. Only a very small portion surviving of the many thousands of hours of videotaped programming made during the 1960s and early 1970s survives. The majority of ABC-TV's mainstream 'original' content (including comedy, drama, variety, news and current affairs) was produced 'in-house'; consequently these programs all suffered considerable losses due to the Corporation's policy of 'recycling' videotape \u2013 a practice further exacerbated by budget cuts in the 1970s. In one notorious case, a controversial installment of the 1970s ABC comedy series ''[[The Off Show]]'' (the infamous \"Leave It To Jesus\" episode) was lost because the show's producer vehemently objected to its religious satire, and deliberately erased the master tape the night before it was due to be broadcast.\n\nNotable losses include:\n\n* most of the 1969\u20131971 episodes of the ABC's weekly current affairs discussion show ''[[Monday Conference (TV show)|Monday Conference]]'';\n* ''[[This Day Tonight]]'' (ABC TV's groundbreaking nightly current affairs show) \u2013 most of the in-studio segments and other pre-recorded video segments were later wiped, although a small proportion of recorded reports survive because it was still common at the time (late 1960s-early 1970s) that location footage for feature stories was shot and edited on film before transfer to video for broadcast, so some of these film sources have survived.\n* the vast majority of episodes the numerous Australian TV pop shows that flourished in the 1960s and early 1970s (many of which emanated from Channel 0 in Melbourne) including ''[[The Go!! Show]], ''[[Kommotion]]'', [[Uptight (TV show)|Uptight]]'' and the'' 'Happening 70 / 71 / 72' series''\n* many episodes of the pioneering [[Australia]]n [[prime time]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', despite the fact that it was independently produced in-house for the 0\u201310 Network.\n\nAll the episodes from the first 12 months' (1969\u20131970) of the ABC's music magazine series ''[[GTK]]'' are now lost. The majority of the material recorded for the post-1970 episodes was rediscovered in ABC archives and storerooms in the early 2000s, when the ABC closed and sold off its [[Gore Hill, Sydney]] studio complex. This due to most of ''GTK'' program segments being recorded on film (in an older part of the studio complex) and then transferred to video for broadcast. Although many broadcast masters were wiped, many more were rescued and hidden by the program's later producer, Bernie Cannon, and nearly all the post-1970 filmed segments, including the archive of live-in-studio performances by local bands, have survived.\n\nOther shows suddenly missing from the archives include most of the first three years' of ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' (episodes beyond 1978 of ''Countdown'' have survived in this manner), nearly all of the hundreds of 15-minute episodes of the ABC's popular soap ''[[Bellbird (TV series)|Bellbird]]'', two thirds of all the taped 166 episodes from the ABC's ''[[Certain Women (television series)|Certain Women]]'', and a large proportion of the Ten Network's hugely popular ''[[Young Talent Time]]'' from the 1971\u20131976 era. Much of the early years of Nine's then-Saturday Morning children's program ''[[Hey Hey it's Saturday]]'' was unrecorded, and many episodes recorded in the early 1970s have since been erased.\n\nSome programs or segments of programs from the mid 1970s onwards have been retrieved from people's [[home taping]] shows off-air (portions of ''Young Talent Time'' and ''Countdown'' have survived in this manner).\n\nNo footage is known to exist of the Melbourne version of ''Tell the Truth''.<ref>http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=1;parentid=;query=tell%20the%20truth%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;rec=6;resCount=10</ref>\n\nGeneral lack of repeats of 1950s and 1960s Australian series makes it difficult to know what is extant and what is lost. For example, there is no information available as whether any episodes still exist of ''[[Take That (TV series)|Take That]]'' (1957\u20131959), sometimes considered to the first Australian television sitcom. Information on archival status is also lacking for other 1950s-era series like ''[[The Isador Goodman Show]]'' (1956\u20131957), ''[[It Pays to Be Funny]]'' (1957\u20131958), ''[[Sweet and Low (TV series)|Sweet and Low]]'' (1959), among others.\n\nSome of the best-known 'survivors' of this period are comedy or drama series commissioned and broadcast by the ABC's commercial rivals. Frequently, these were outsourced productions made by private companies, such as ''[[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo|Skippy]]'', and most notably the many drama series made by Melbourne-based [[Crawford Productions]] (a production brand of [[WIN Television]]), which at its peak in the 1970s had major primetime series running concurrently on all three Australian commercial networks. Crawfords retained the rights to its productions, and was able to earn money from reruns, so most of its production output was preserved. Crawford is now unique in Australian TV history because it still owns and markets a comprehensive archive of all its major productions from the 1960s and beyond, including ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'', ''[[Division 4]]'', ''[[Matlock Police]]'', and ''[[The Sullivans]]''.\n\nThe [[National Film and Sound Archive]] holdings of 1950s era shows include several episodes of the 1957 discussion series ''[[Leave It to the Girls (Australian TV series)|Leave it to the Girls]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22leave+it+to+the+girls%22+Media:%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10|title=NFSA \u2013 Search Results|website=colsearch.nfsa.gov.au}}</ref> most of the 1958\u20131959 soap opera ''[[Autumn Affair]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22autumn+affair%22+Media:%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10|title=NFSA \u2013 Search Results|website=colsearch.nfsa.gov.au}}</ref> and a number of episodes of the comedy game show ''[[The Pressure Pak Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22pressure+pak+show%22+Years:%3E=1957+Years:%3C=1959+Media:%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10|title=NFSA \u2013 Search Results|website=colsearch.nfsa.gov.au}}</ref> These shows, produced by ATN-7 in Sydney, probably survive because they were pre-recorded for the purpose of interstate broadcast (''Autumn Affair'', despite primitive production values, was repeated into the 1960s).\n\n===Belgium===\n* Only 9 of the 185 episodes of the Flemish sitcom ''[[Schipper naast Mathilde]]'' from 1955\u20131963 survive.\n* Most Flemish youth series from the 1950s were not preserved: ''Bolletje en Bonestaak'' (1955), ''Jan zonder Vrees'' (''[[John the Fearless]]'', 1956), ''Schatteneiland'' (''[[Treasure Island]]'', 1957), ''Reis om de wereld in 80 dagen'' (''[[Around the World in Eighty Days|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', 1957), and ''Professor Kwit'' (1958).

The ninth edition of 1964 is said to have been recorded on tape, but a fire reportedly destroyed the copy at [[Danmarks Radio|DR]], the broadcaster who produced the contest. Another recording of the contest, however, does exist at the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|French television archives]], but is not yet available to view online.<ref>http://inatheque.ina.fr/doc/TV-RADIO/DA_CPF96003532/9eme-concours-eurovision-de-la-chanson-1964?rang=21</ref> Only small portions of the original broadcast and audio from the radio transmission are viewable for the time being.\n\n===Ireland===\n\n*The [[Republic of Ireland]] was a latecomer to television, [[Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] being established in 1962. Although early news broadcasts were recorded on [[kinescope]]s, almost all broadcasts from the first fifteen years (i.e. up to 1977) are lost. Of the soap opera ''[[Tolka Row]]'' (1964\u201368) only the last episode survives, while almost all the early episodes of ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' (1962\u2013present) are lost. Even when shows were sent abroad \u2014 ''[[The Riordans]]'' was sent to Australia for rebroadcast \u2014 the tapes were often sent back to Ireland and recorded over, as they were so expensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcu.ie/~sheehanh/60s-itvd.htm|title=Irish television drama in the 1960s|first=Dr Helena|last=Sheehan|website=www.dcu.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Linehan|first1=Hugh|title=RT\u00c9 archive a treasure trove of faces, voices and memories|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/rt%C3%A9-archive-a-treasure-trove-of-faces-voices-and-memories-1.2665155|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=May 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\n* The 23rd, 24th and 25th editions of the Italian [[Sanremo Festival]] of 1973, 1974 and 1975 have been lost in Italian Public Broadcasting archives and never recovered. Only some portions of the original tapes have survived in the Daily News Archives. The whole 17th edition of 1967 is missing as well, supposedly handed to the public authorities because of the investigation of [[Luigi Tenco]]'s suicide. The 26th edition of 1976 was lost by [[RAI]] but it could be recovered in the [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|Spanish Broadcasting Company]]'s (TVE) vaults, since it was broadcast all around Europe and recorded by TVE.\n\n===Japan===\n* 31 segments of the original 1973 ''[[Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon]]'' are lost due to the studio warehouse that stored all content of the show, having to sell the reels off for money, which ultimately failed in the end. The show only lasted for 26 episodes\u2014it was interrupted due to the dissolution of Nippon TV Video, the production studio. 21 episodes are known to survive, two of which have no audio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-strange-case-of-the-1973-doraemon-series/|title=The Strange Case of the 1973 \"Doraemon\" Series {{!}} Cartoon Research|website=cartoonresearch.com|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref> The final episode was called \"Sayonara Doraemon\" (Goodbye Doraemon) and aired on September 30, 1973. Audio, still images, the opening theme and ending theme survive all together. In 1995, 16 episodes were found to be stored in Studio Rush (now known as IMAGICA), and other segments have been found, though two remain without their audio tracks. The opening and ending credits do still exist as well, along with a pilot film that was produced in 1972. These are occasionally shown at ''[[Doraemon]]'' fan conventions in Japan, but cannot be released legally on DVD owing to rights complications due to the production studio being defunct. According to the Japanese Wikipedia, with the dissolution of [[Nippon TV]] Video, the film reels to the series and other possessions wound up sold off to cover debt, while other belongings in the studio and production materials were either thrown out in the garbage or destroyed in a kerosene fire. Also it was briefly rebroadcast in 1979, but was abruptly pulled off television by order of Shogakukan, who did not want the [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|new adaptation]]'s reputation to be affected by the existence of the previous one, or for child viewers to be confused at the two different versions, so theories that a fire in the warehouse happened accidentally burnt down footage and it was never broadcast again are false.\n* All the episodes of the first ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]'' anime first broadcast in 1966 were believed to be lost sometime after the 1970s reruns ended until said material was found in 1990 in storage at the Senrioka studio of Mainichi Broadcasting.\n* The entirety of the [[Toho]] tokusatsu television series ''[[Assault! Human!!]]'', originally produced and aired in 1972, was lost at some point after the series was rebroadcast in the 1980's, after Nippon TV accidentally overwrote the master tapes. While suits from the show were reused by Toho in ''[[Go! Godman]]'' and ''[[Go! Greenman]]'', the only traces of ''Assault Human!'' come in the form of supplementary materials such as reference books, merchandise, magazine articles and the show's soundtrack; in addition, a fragment of footage roughly 1 minute long was uncovered in the mid-2010s, having been transferred from a [[Betamax]] tape.\n* All episodes of the [[Osamu Tezuka|Tezuka]] anime ''[[Big X]]'' are said to be lost except for episodes 1, 11, and 40\u201359.\n* Only episodes 37 and 38 of ''Space Alien Pipi'' survive, along with the opening and ending theme.\n* Certain episodes of ''[[Perman]]'' are lost, some have picture but no audio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/lost-tv-anime/|title=Lost TV Anime {{!}} Cartoon Research|website=cartoonresearch.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\n* The most famous missing programs are the children's shows ''Ja zuster nee zuster'' from the 1960s and most of [[Hamelen (TV series)|''Hamelin'' (''Kunt u mij de weg naar Hamelen vertellen'')]] from the 1970s. \n* 1970s-era Dutch series ''The Eddy-Go-Round Show'' hosted by Eddy Becker, despite featuring high-profile guests, is reported to have been largely erased by the broadcaster it aired on,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbaontv.com/1975/description-eddy-go-round.html|title=ABBA on TV \u2013 The Eddy Go Round Show|website=www.abbaontv.com}}</ref> though a short section featuring Swedish pop group [[ABBA]] performing \"[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]\" was later uncovered on a tape recorded by a home viewer.

The first full surviving episode was broadcast on August 7, 1982, the third anniversary of the show.\n* The inaugural game of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) in 1975, along with most of the games that were broadcast during the first seven seasons of the league, are believed to be lost. The oldest known full game archive of the league was from the 1979 season. Most of the league's playoffs games, including a significant number of games involving Ginebra, were missing in the PBA archives, when the archive was digitized in 2010. Short clips of older games are in possession of private collectors.\n* The television archive of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] from 1953 to 1972 are believed lost, when the station was taken over by the government of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] when he declared martial law in the country. (In addition, ABS-CBN alleged in its complaint-affidavit filed after the [[People Power Revolution]] against Roberto Benedicto (who took over ABS-CBN's facilities following the declaration of martial law) that \"the musical records and radio dramas accumulated by ABS-CBN in a span of twenty-five (25) years and stored in its library were now gone\".)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/october2008/133347.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104054054/http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/october2008/133347.htm |archive-date=2014-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* The status of the archived broadcasts of [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]], the television network that took over ABS-CBN's facilities from 1973 to 1986 is unknown.\n\n===Spain===\n* Hundreds of episodes from the internationally versioned show ''[[Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez]]'', mainly from the first two seasons (1972\u20131973 and 1976\u20131978), including the first episode of the first season, are lost or were destroyed. Only four episodes out of 54 from the first season and 12 out of 83 from the second season are known to survive. The following seasons from the third to the fifth one (1982\u20131986) are also incomplete, but not as dramatically diminished as the previous seasons. The sixth season of 1987 is the first fully located and preserved one. Since Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola archives were not catalogued until 1987, and there are thousands of tapes in kilometers of shelves of unknown uncatalogued content, there could be more episodes there than what is preserved today (the last previously thought lost then found episode from the first season was just discovered in 2005). Also, some of the lost episodes of seasons two, three, four and five exist as either complete or as portions on the archives or on home video recordings by viewers of the show.\n\n===Greece===\n* The vast majority of Greek television shows before the 1980s are considered lost, as [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] never took archiving seriously. Recent efforts have been made to archive what is left, but the material is very limited.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main article|List of lost television broadcasts in the United Kingdom}}\n* Early [[BBC]]-created programmes from the 1930s and 1940s such as ''[[Telecrimes]]'', ''[[Pinwright's Progress]]'', ''[[The Disorderly Room]]'', ''[[Sports Review]]'', ''[[Theatre Parade]]'', and the play ''[[Wasp's Nest (Theatre Parade)|Wasp's Nest]]'', were usually shown live and not recorded. The only visual evidence of these programmes today consists of still photographs.\n* All recordings of the early televised [[Francis Durbridge]] serials from 1952 to 1959 were completely destroyed, and the first two (''[[Broken Horseshoe]]'' and ''[[Operation Diplomat (TV series)|Operation Diplomat]]'') were never recorded.\n* Only one episode survived from the 1961 TV Series ''Call Oxbridge 2000''.\n* Four of the six episodes of ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'', Britain's first [[science fiction]] television programme aimed at an adult audience, were never recorded; the two existing episodes are the oldest [[BBC]] recordings of any fictional series today.\n* ''[[The Madhouse on Castle Street]]'', a 1963 [[BBC]] teleplay starring a then-unknown [[Bob Dylan]], is considered lost. It was erased in 1968, and despite attempts by the [[British Film Institute]] to recover it, a telerecorded copy has still not been found {{as of|2009|lc=on}}.\n*In autumn 1967, ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' had made such impact on viewers of the show that the producers of [[Associated Television|ATV]]'s Saturday evening live game show ''[[The Golden Shot]]'' decided for their Christmas special to dedicate the show to ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons''. The show was presented by [[Bob Monkhouse]]. ''The Golden Shot'' consisted of a number of shooting games where viewers using their telephone directed a blindfolded marksman to fire his crossbow at illuminated apples attached to illustrated backgrounds. For the Captain Scarlet edition, the target board featured individual painted scenes from the TV series ''The Mysterons Complex'', ''Angel Interceptors'', ''Spectrum Helicopter and the Angel Interceptors'', Spectrum Helicopter and the Angels exiting the Amber Room on their injector seats. Captain Scarlet was the star guest (designated Golden Partner) the puppet of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] sat at [[Colonel White]]'s desk whilst [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]] supplied the voice off- camera. A musical performance was supplied by \"The Spectrum\" who sang their latest hit song \"Headin for a Heatwave\" and the hosts Anne Aston and Carol Dilworth wore Angel Uniforms. The show was originally broadcast live on Saturday 23 December 1967, [[Associated Television|ATV]] London region at 8:35pm. It was then shown the next day at 1:05pm on [[Associated Television|ATV]] Midlands region. Since these airings all the archive footage of this show has been wiped.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bentley |first= Chris |coauthors= |title= The Complete Book of \"Captain Scarlet\" |publisher= Carlton Books Ltd |date=August 2001 |isbn= 1-84222-405-0}}</ref>\n* Many early music programmes, such as ''[[Ready Steady Go!|Ready Steady Go]]'' and (until the mid-1970s, most episodes of) ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' are lost, so many significant television appearances\u2014such as [[The Beatles]]' last live television performance in 1966, and most appearances of [[Pink Floyd]] with [[Syd Barrett]]\u2014are unavailable.\n* 97 black and white episodes of the [[BBC]] sci-fi show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', all from the tenures of [[William Hartnell]] and [[Patrick Troughton]] (the first two [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctors]]), do not exist in the BBC's archives (see [[Doctor Who missing episodes|''Doctor Who'' missing episodes]]), though they have an ongoing appeal for help from viewers who may have recorded the shows during their original airings. Audio recordings exist for all of the lost episodes, however, all of which have been released commercially by the BBC. Several episodes of various serials, including ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'', ''[[The Reign of Terror (Doctor Who)|The Reign of Terror]]'', ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'', (all episodes that survive only in audio form) were reconstructed using animation for various DVD releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/missingepisodes.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The missing episodes.|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The BBC also holds many extant clips from the lost episodes ranging from such sources as an 8&nbsp;mm camera, censored clips physically cut from the episodes, insert shots, and clips shown on 1960s and 1970s programmes (most notably ''[[Blue Peter]]''). As recently as late 2013 (when the five previously missing episodes of ''[[The Enemy of the World]]'' and four of the five missing episodes of ''[[The Web of Fear]]'' were discovered) occasional lost episodes have continued to be discovered. The only episode thought to be permanently irrecoverable is \"The Feast of Steven\", from the 1965\u20131966 serial ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]''.\n* The BBC [[wiping|wiped]] many editions of ''[[Not Only... But Also]]'', starring [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]] from its archives in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as it did with many other programmes. Cook and Moore had even allegedly offered to pay for the cost of preservation and buy new videotapes so that the old tapes would not need to be reused, but this offer was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/notonlybutalso/index.shtml|title=BBC Comedy page on \"Not Only...

Many series, such as football-themed soap opera ''[[United!]]'', are missing in their entirety, while others only survive in fragments such as ''[[A for Andromeda]]'', a science fiction series that was [[Julie Christie]]'s first major role. \n* [[Dad's Army missing episodes|Three episodes]] from the second series of ''[[Dad's Army]]'' are missing as are almost half of the editions of ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''. Almost all editions of ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' are missing as are more than half of the episodes of ''[[Z-Cars]]''.\n* Most of the archives of two [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractors [[Associated British Corporation]] (ABC) and [[Associated-Rediffusion]] were destroyed in the 1970s after they were merged to become [[Thames Television]]. Associated-Rediffusion's archive suffered considerably more damage than [[Associated British Corporation]]'s, leaving little of ''[[No Hiding Place]]'', ''[[The Rat Catchers]]'', and other programmes. Almost all of the entire first series of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was erased shortly after transmission.\n* The original black-and-white recording of the premiere episode of the British series ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'' (1970\u20131975) does not exist in any form with the possible exception of a few stills and the location footage which features at the start of the shot-in-color rerecording of the premiere episode. The original recording took place on November 13, 1970, and was in monochrome owing to a dispute with studio technicians, who refused to work with colour recording equipment as part of a work to rule. The following five episodes were also recorded in monochrome before the dispute ended with the recording of episode 6 in color on February 12, 1971. After the entire thirteen-episode season run had been recorded, it was decided to rerecord the first episode in color to gain the highest possible audience for its first UK transmission and to help with overseas sales. The rerecording took place on May 21, 1971, and the series' UK debut was on October 10, 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.updown.org.uk/epguide/s1.htm|title=Upstairs, Downstairs \u2013 Season One|website=www.updown.org.uk}}</ref> The original monochrome recording was never transmitted and was wiped. All of the other five black-and-white episodes from series One survive.\n* Most editions of the controversial and anarchic British children's Saturday morning television series ''[[Tiswas]]'' were transmitted live without any official recording and many of the original master tapes of such editions as did get recorded by the broadcaster were wiped or left to deteriorate after the series was canceled in 1982. When a series of ''Tiswas'' highlight compilation tapes was released on video in the early 1990s (followed in 2006 by a DVD), much of the footage appeared to have been culled from the off-air recordings of private archivists.\n* ''Black Limelight'' is a stage play which was adapted for British television three times, with each version being lost. These include a 1952 version as part of ''[[Sunday Night Theatre]]'', which was broadcast live and never recorded,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=75b99d8f-48c9-40a9-8cd4-7a3e123b54d1|title=TVBrain \u2013 Kaleidoscope \u2013 Lost shows \u2013 TV Archive \u2013 TV History|website=www.lostshows.com}}</ref> a 1956 version as part of ''[[Armchair Theatre]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=7155cd25-2194-4007-b263-7c135cec5347|title=TVBrain \u2013 Kaleidoscope \u2013 Lost shows \u2013 TV Archive \u2013 TV History|website=www.lostshows.com}}</ref> and a 1962 version as part of ''[[BBC Sunday-Night Play]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=d9b43ef8-6c3c-47be-9834-4c9368639edc|title=TVBrain \u2013 Kaleidoscope \u2013 Lost shows \u2013 TV Archive \u2013 TV History|website=www.lostshows.com}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n* Most of the earliest American [[mechanical television]] programs of the early 1930s, including ''[[The Television Ghost]]'', ''[[Piano Lessons (TV series)|Piano Lessons]]'' and variety shows by [[Helen Haynes]] and [[Harriet Lee (TV series)|Harriet Lee]], are considered lost, as no methods existed to preserve them. Only promotional pictures of the shows still exist.<ref>Hawes, William, American Television Drama: The Experimental Years (University of Alabama Press, 1986)</ref>\n* Almost no audio or film material of any television shows from prior to 1948 exist. One of the few exceptions was ''[[Hour Glass (TV series)|Hour Glass]]'', an early variety show that ran from 1946 to 1947 and was preserved in the form of audio and, in the case of one episode, still pictures.\n* The debut broadcast of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called ''Toast of the Town'') from June 20, 1948, is considered lost. The episode featured what is almost certainly the first television appearance of the [[Martin and Lewis|comedy act]] of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n* Nearly the entire film archive of the [[DuMont Television Network]] (1946\u20131956), consisting of approximately 175 television series, are missing, presumed destroyed. From the ten years of this network, only about 100 kinescope and originally film episodes of DuMont series survive at the [[Library of Congress]], [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], the [[Paley Center for Media]] in New York, Chicago's [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]], on [[YouTube]] or [[Internet Archive]], or in private collections. In 1996, early television actress [[Edie Adams]] testified at a hearing in front of a panel of the [[Library of Congress]] on the preservation of American television and video, that little value was given to the DuMont film archive by the 1970s, and that all the remaining kinescoped episodes of DuMont series were loaded into three trucks and dumped into [[Upper New York Bay]].<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Edie |authorlink=Edie Adams |title=Television/Video Preservation Study: Los Angeles Public Hearing |work=National Film Preservation Board |publisher=Library of Congress |date=March 1996 |url=https://www.loc.gov/film/hrng96la.html |accessdate=2008-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072638/http://www.loc.gov/film/hrng96la.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> See [[List of surviving DuMont Television Network broadcasts]] for more info.\n* The ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' television program, broadcast in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and other local areas, which featured the first television appearance of [[Elvis Presley]]. Only an audio recording taken from the acetate disc of Presley's complete performance, singing \"Tweedlee Dee\", \"Money Honey\", \"Hearts of Stone\", \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", \"That's All Right\" and \"You're a Heartbreaker\" on the program, has survived. Original broadcast date was March 5, 1955.\n* None of the episodes of the 1954\u201355 series ''[[The Vampira Show]]'', the first television horror movie show, were ever preserved. One film, containing a recreation of an episode that was made for a promotional reel for the station that aired the show, survives.\n* The 1957 syndicated cartoon ''[[Colonel Bleep]]'' has approximately half of its episodes still missing. The entire master archive was stolen in the early 1970s, never to be found, and the current collection is taken from the various tapes sent out to individual stations, approximately half of which have been found.\n* The 1957 CBS production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'' starring [[Julie Andrews]] was believed to be lost for years. It was rediscovered in the late 1990s, but only in black-and-white kinescope; the original color broadcast has been lost. The kinescope has since been released on DVD.\n* Almost all of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jack Paar]] and the first ten years (1962\u20131972) hosted by [[Johnny Carson]] were taped over by the network and no longer exist. The videotape was being used repeatedly, hence the reason that Carson's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' picture looked muddy during broadcast in the late 1960s. Selected sequences from the 1962\u20131972 era survive and were often replayed by Carson himself (particularly in the months preceding his retirement in 1992) and have been released to home video; some audiotapes and still pictures of those years also exist. Some Paar episodes also survive and have also been released to home video (in this case, DVD).\n* Similarly, NBC reused the tapes of ventriloquist [[Shari Lewis]]'s 1960\u20131963 Saturday morning children's program ''[[The Shari Lewis Show]]'', to record coverage of the 1964 [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] [[United States presidential nominating convention|National Convention]]s. Lewis said in an interview decades later that to her, this was a shame, since the shows were beautifully done as a showcase of NBC's early color broadcast work.\n* As of 2011, 1968's [[Super Bowl II]] is the only [[Super Bowl]] without any surviving telecast recording. A nearly complete color tape of [[Super Bowl I]] was discovered in 2005, but kept secret for nearly five years; portions of telecasts up through [[Super Bowl V]] are either missing or only exist in black-and-white. [[NFL Films]], the league's official filmmaker, produced their own copies (at a higher quality than a live television broadcast could produce at the time) of the games for posterity.\n* [[videocassette recorder|Home VCRs]], first introduced in November 1975, were still uncommon until the early 1980s. It is unlikely that lost television episodes exist in the collections of individuals, though this occasionally happens. Home audio recordings, however, were relatively common at the time, and audio recordings of these episodes are somewhat more common. One well-known example of an early home video recording being the only surviving footage of an event is a clip of [[John Lennon]] visiting the announcers' booth during a 1974 ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] lost the footage of this event, but a private collector's copy appears in the ''[[Beatles Anthology]]''. Similarly, home [[kinescope]]s of [[World Football League]] recorded as game film serve as the only surviving copies of several games in that league's short history.\n* Another such example occurred with the Sergio Leone film ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''. When it was originally broadcast in the United States in 1975, an alternate opening was shot to meet the standards and practices guidelines of the network. This opening was subsequently lost by the network, but had been taped by a fan of the film and was placed on the special edition DVD.\n* The first live sporting event broadcast by [[ESPN]] was the first game of the 1979 Softball World Series in men's professional slow-pitch softball. Roughly 20 years later, the manager of the Kentucky Bourbons, losers in the series, contacted ESPN about acquiring a copy of that game, and was told that this was the only lost broadcast in the network's history. However, it was later found that the owner of the series-winning Milwaukee Schlitz had previously purchased a copy of this broadcast, and still had the tapes in his possession. The tapes were produced and eventually became the centerpiece of an ''[[E:60]]'' episode that aired as part of the network's 40th anniversary celebration in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdrb.com/news/kentucky-bourbons-players-reunite-to-commemorate-special-moment-in-espn/article_d6d3db5a-f430-11e9-a7cf-6732530f6d4c.html |title=Kentucky Bourbons players reunite to commemorate special moment in ESPN history |first=Scott |last=Reynolds |publisher=[[WDRB]] |location=Louisville, KY |date=October 21, 2019 |accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* Most US daytime soap opera episodes broadcast before 1978 have been lost. The status of episodes, however, varies widely from show to show:\n** Soaps produced by [[Procter & Gamble|Procter & Gamble Productions]], including ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', and ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' began preserving their episodes in 1978. A few scattered episodes, mostly black and white kinescopes, of these series exist from the 1950s, 1960s, and early to mid-1970s. The CBS soaps ''[[Love of Life]]'' and ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', as well as several short-lived shows, suffered the same fate.\n** ABC's ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]'' were originally owned by their creator, [[Agnes Nixon]], who chose to archive all episodes. However, early episodes of ''AMC'' were only saved as black-and-white kinescopes despite being produced and telecast in color. ABC purchased the shows in late 1974; different sources report that Nixon's archive was either lost in a fire or erased. A few black-and-white kinescopes of both series' early years exist, as well as a few color episodes. ABC began full archiving of these soaps at Nixon's insistence when they expanded from 30 minutes to an hour\u2014''AMC'' in 1977, and ''OLTL'' in 1978.\n** Most 1963\u20131970 episodes of ABC's longest-running ''[[General Hospital]]'' survive because the series was then owned by Selmur Productions. Few episodes from 1970 to 1977 were saved. ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' premiered in 1975, several years before ABC began saving all of its daytime programming, but exists in its entirety as it was originally owned by Labine-Mayer Productions.\n**''[[Dark Shadows]]'', created by Dan Curtis, which ran from 1966 to 1971, has the distinction of being one of the few soap operas to have nearly all of its original episodes preserved. As a result of kinescope, many earlier episodes of which the master film was lost are still available. However, episode #1219 was lost but reconstructed with an audio recording for home video release.\n** Two long-running soaps have full archives: ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', which premiered in 1965, and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', which premiered in 1973. Both series were originally distributed by [[Screen Gems]].\n* The original [[slow-scan TV]] footage of the [[Apollo 11|first manned moon landing]] in 1969, believed to be of significantly higher quality than the standards-converted version broadcast on TV, is missing from [[NASA]]'s archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/apollo11_sstv_search_report.html|title=The Search for the Apollo 11 SSTV Tapes \u2013 21 May 2006|website=www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013002065.html|title=The Saga Of the Lost Space Tapes|first=Marc|last=Kaufman|date=31 January 2007|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> This, among other things, has led to many [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the landings]], though both NASA and non-NASA authorities have repeatedly debunked any claims of foul play. See [[Apollo 11 missing tapes]].\n* Almost all daytime [[game show]]s from the 1970s and before have been destroyed. [[CBS]]'s archives begin in 1972, ABC's in 1978, and NBC's in 1980. A handful of producers (most notably [[Mark Goodson|Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman|Todman]]) did arrange for the preservation of their shows even during the tape-recycling period.\n** The original ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' (NBC, 1964\u20131975) has less than 1% of its episodes (24 out of 2,753) still in existence.\n** Approx. 130 episodes of ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' (NBC, 1966\u20131981) were broadcast on [[Game Show Network]], mostly the 1968 NBC nighttime version and 1971\u20131976 syndicated episodes; NBC allegedly destroyed the remainder when it was announced that GSN acquired the rights to the ''Squares'' episodes.\n** ''[[Snap Judgment (game show)|Snap Judgment]]'' (NBC, 1967\u20131969) is completely destroyed (a rarity for a Goodson-Todman produced show) with only one episode existing on audio tape.\n** ''[[The Big Showdown]]'' (ABC, 1974\u20131975) has only two full episodes surviving, namely the 1974 pilot and episode #67, which aired in March 1975. A video clip of another bonus round exists, along with an ABC promo and an undated audio clip of an opening. An audio recording of the July 4, 1975 finale exists and circulates among collectors.\n** ''[[Second Chance (game show)|Second Chance]]'' (ABC, 1977), once thought completely lost other than a pilot episode, has three known episodes surviving, with one (the series finale) only existing on audiotape.\n** ''[[High Rollers]]'' (NBC and syndication, 1974\u20131976 and 1978\u20131980) has only twelve episodes remaining: two from the first run and ten from the second, including the finale.\n** ''[[Winning Streak (US game show)|Winning Streak]]'' (NBC, 1974\u20131975) has only two episodes remaining (one is noteworthy in that it was intended to air August 9, 1974, but was preempted due to coverage of [[Nixon resignation|Richard Nixon's resignation]] and [[inauguration of Gerald Ford]]), plus the opening portion of a third.\n** ''[[Eye Guess]]'' (NBC, 1966\u20131969) has only one and a half episodes remaining.\n** The second version of ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]'' (NBC, 1983\u20131984) has only a handful of episodes remaining; the show's master tapes were accidentally destroyed by a flood in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TVPMM/posts/688309631183817|title=Facebook post by TVPMM|website=Facebook|publisher=Museum of Television Production Music|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=27 July 2013|quote=Just confirmed that all 395 episodes from 1983/84 Dream House videotape masters were destroyed in a flood with production materials/music.}}</ref>\n** The nighttime version of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' (syndication, 1972\u20131980) has not been destroyed, but has remained within the confines of the CBS/FremantleMedia archives since their original airings due to a dispute with former executive producer and host [[Bob Barker]]. Barker requested that the episodes in question be withheld due to his position against the offering of animal-made prizes, such as fur coats. Episodes which featured these prizes before Bob prohibited them have been blocked from circulation. This includes the entire hosting span of [[Dennis James]], who hosted from 1972 to 1977. According to former ''Price'' staff member Scott Robinson, who discovered the documentation for the nighttime version among the program's archives during his tenure at the show, of the 301 episodes recorded, there were no more than five that did ''not'' have a fur coat. Additionally, the first taped episode (001N) is not in the archives.\n*** James personally recorded nearly all of Seasons 1\u20133, along with scattered episodes of Seasons 4\u20135, at his home from KNBC's airings (James preserved a great deal of his own work as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 supplement); however, the former set of broadcasts were taped onto [[Cartrivision]] [[V-Cord]] and [[VX (videocassette format)|VX]], recording media that is now obscure. Approximately six full-length episodes (two from 1972, one each from 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977) with James hosting and one from Barker's tenure (the final show, from 1980) circulate as master copies, and home audio recordings from about 30 others from 1973 to 1975 (spanning the second, third, and early fourth seasons) also circulate.\n** The first daytime version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (NBC, 1975\u20131989) is destroyed through at least 1979, with a King World representative stating in August 2006 that creator [[Merv Griffin]]'s production company continued reusing tapes into 1985. GSN holds all episodes after the cutoff point, airing three (from 1976, 1982, and 1989) following Griffin's death in 2007. Despite not being among the three, clips of a March 1978 episode were used for a c.-2004 ''Total Living'' interview with original host [[Chuck Woolery]], using a then-current (for the interview) GSN logo. Fans have since hypothesized that GSN made or received copies from the [[Paley Center for Media]], which holds all four episodes in question.\n**The 1989 version of ''[[Now You See It (American game show)#1989|Now You See It]]'' has not been destroyed, but has been withheld from circulation since its original run at the request of host [[Chuck Henry]].\n**All episodes of the [[Jay Wolpert]]-produced game shows ''[[Whew!]]'' (CBS, 1979\u20131980) and ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' (CBS, 1988) are intact, but both shows have not been rerun since their cancellation.\n* The joint Japanese and English masters for the original 1960s version of ''[[Tetsuwan Atom]]''/''[[Astro Boy]]'' were destroyed in 1975 by NBC after the syndication of the series ended and Tezuka Productions, which was undergoing bankruptcy at the time refused them for lack of funds to receive them. When [[The Right Stuf]] gained the license for the series, they were forced to find broadcast copies of the show and mate them with English sound masters that were still extant.\n* A number of episodes of the early-1960s sitcom ''[[My Living Doll]]'' are either lost or only survive in poor condition. The 2011 DVD release of the first half of the season includes an on-screen plea to anyone who might have prints of the missing episodes.\n* Most of the 1980s talk show ''[[Hot Seat (talk show)|Hot Seat]] with [[Wally George]]'' broadcast before the show going into syndication were destroyed; the producing station ([[KDOC-TV]] in the Orange County, California area) could not afford to archive the show. Many episodes that were nationally syndicated do exist.\n* Sixty episodes of the long-running ''[[Sesame Street]]'' do not exist in the archives of [[Sesame Workshop]]. This list of lost episodes includes the debut of long-running cast member [[Linda (Sesame Street)|Linda]] and [[Oscar the Grouch|Oscar the Grouch's]] pet worm, [[Slimey the Worm|Slimey]].\n* ''[[The Paul Winchell Show]]'', also known as ''The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show'' was a children's show hosted by ventriloquist and voice actor [[Paul Winchell]] on [[Metromedia|Metromedia Television's]] [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]]. All of the episodes are said to have been lost after station management vindictively erased tapes in 1970 in retaliation after Winchell refused Metromedia's syndication deal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grassiniandwrinkle.com/pdfs/press_winchell.pdf|title=Ventriloquist wins $17.8 million award in Metromedia suit|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eejlaw.com/materials/April_Enterprises_v_KTTV_E08_ed.pdf|title=April Enterprises Inc. v.

Currently, only one episode has been remastered in its original 1969 broadcast: the episode \"Go Away Ghost Ship\". The others, as well as all eight season two episodes, are presumed to be unviewable in their original broadcast. The reprints are easily noticeable due to there being a lower pitch than the originals.\n|-\n| ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''\n| 1951\u20131982\n| Because CBS wiped it, thousands of episodes no longer exist.

His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite
