According to Father Juan Paguere, it was just a wide and long stretch of virgin land located at the southern most end of the province of Cagayan. In 1718, the Govierno Superior ordered the place to become one of the barrios of Tuguegarao. It was named \u201cCabugag\u201d or in short Cabug, the dialect term for hunchback for the first settler was a man with this deformity. So the place was named after him. The name \u201cCabug\u201d is engraved on the town\u2019s first church bell which is still found in the steeple.\n\nIn 1724, The Dominican Friars have thought of giving the barrios their Patron Saint. Cabug was given \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Caldas\u201d. The old prominent residents of the barrio had chosen the sixth day of August as her feast day. As year went by, the land area and population of the barrio increased with surprising rapidly. The Cagayan River which flowed close to the barrio site gradually changed its course and moved further towards Cataggaman as flood plains were formed. The non Christian inhabitants called Kalingas gradually deserted the barrio and moved westward to the Mountain Province. As a result, more agricultural lands were cleared and cultivated. Tobacco and corn are the chief crops of the people.\n\nIn September 1849, the Govierno Superior ordered the separation of Cabug from the municipality of Tuguegarao to become a town by itself. The new town was named Enrile in honor of Governor Pascual Enrile who was responsible for building roads in the northern part of Luzon during those days. The separation of Enrile from Tuguegarao led to a change of its patron saint. The population unanimously adopted \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Nieves\u201d as its patron Saint. The fifth day of August was selected as her feast day. Since then the feast day had always been celebrated pompously.\n\nAccording to Father Julian Malumbres in his Historia de Cagayan, the name \u201cCabug\u201d was first recorded in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers on January 20, 1849. However the town was known as \u201cCabug\u201d even up 1863 when the name Enrile was officially written and road in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta.

While Enrile has limited natural resources, it takes pride in its human resources. Almost every family in the community has a member that is of the professional class. Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.\n\nIn 1690, the town of Enrile was a virgin forest on the southernmost portion of the province of Cagayan.\n\nIn 1724 or thereabouts, it was named Cabug, a barrio of Tuguegarao City and it now celebrates its feast day on August 6, later changed to August 5, in honor of its Patron Saint Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Caldas.\n\nIn the chronicle of Fray Julian Manumbres, Cabug as a geographical unit was officially recorded on January 20, 1849. And although the name Enrile was officially written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town of Enrile was still known as \u201cCabug\u201d.\n\nKalingas, the early settlers, were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with staple products and tobacco.\n\nWith the increasing production and number of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed \u201cCabug\u201d separated from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Nieves.\n\nThis proclamed \u201cCabug\u201d as \u201cEnrile\u201d in honor of Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the construction of Luzon\u2019s highways.\n\nSinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when they retreated from pursuing American forces.\n\nToday the town of Enrile not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry industry.\n\n== Head of Government ==\n=== Gobernadorcillos ===\nA.

DA Assistant Secretary for Agribusiness Leandro Gazmin, who went to Enrile to represent Alcala during the peanut harvest ceremony, said the soil suitability of the town \u2013 sandy to sandy-loam \u2013 and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round are the \u201cprimary reasons why it will be known as an important source of peanut henceforth.\u201d\n\nGazmin said the Secretary lauds them for their collective effort but that the DA chief requests that they \u201ccommit themselves to improve and develop even further not just the peanut industry but the entire agricultural sector as well.\u201d\n\nHe said the Secretary is also happy to know that farmers have been receptive to new technologies hence, they are able to increase productivity from 1.5 to 1.8 tons per hectare.\n\nDuring the peanut harvest, the DA regional office turned over to the local government of Enrile over P4-million worth of farm machineries and equipment, including one unit four-wheel drive tractor, four units of mill for corngrits, 10 heads of carabao, 2,500 kilos of peanut seeds for planting and 300 bags of open-pollinated corn variety.\n\nThough peanut is considered a high value crop by DA, not just in Enrile but in neighboring towns of Pe\u00f1ablanca and Tuguegarao (Cagayan) and Sta. Maria and Cabagan in Isabela, the former was chosen as \u201cnumber one\u201d for having the \u201chighest production share of 1,800 metric tons per year or 8 to10 percent of the national supply.\u201d\n\nAlso, Enrile is the only municipality that can cultivate peanuts during the dry and wet season cropping, the DA said.\n\nDA Region II Executive Director Lucrecio Alviar said that per cropping, the town of Enrile is able to produce a big chunk of the national production, making it the major source of raw materials for various peanut-based products processed and sold in Metro Manila.\n\nEnrile is home to 800 peanut farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential expansion area of another 800 hectares. \u201cWith improved production and yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons,\u201d Alviar added.\n\nWith the use of technology from DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) \u2013 particularly the use of improved varieties and fertilizers like Boron and Gypsum \u2013 the DA is optimistic that \u201cpeanut production could reach an all-time high of 3.25 tons per hectare,\u201d or an increase of 200 percent over its current average. The DA said it hopes the farmers can sustain their productivity.\n\nGazmin also encouraged peanut farmers to bring their harvest to the Isabela Agri-Pinoy Trading Center, where they can directly sell their produce. The Isabela APTC is part of the government\u2019s effort to empower farmers to become traders to enhance their incomes, stabilize food prices and encourage them to produce more. \u201cLet us utilize the center as a venue for cooperativism\u201d and enabling each other to produce and earn more, he said.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:1Enrile.jpg|alt=|thumb|1 Enrile.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\nEnrile's economy is driven by our agriculture industry, primarily the production of rice, corn, peanuts and mongo crops. Our high school and college graduates have the largest percentage of graduation and promotion to professional occupations in the entire province. In the last 15-years, our community has dramatically risen from a 6th class designation to our current classification of three.\n\nThe municipality was named after [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish governor-general]] [[Pasqual Enrile y Alcedo]].\n\nCabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta. Maria, Isabela to the south, by the mighty Cagayan River\u00a0 to the east, by Solana and Tuguegarao to the north, Kalinga to the west.\n\nEnrile is predominantly an agricultural town where the majority of its population derive their income from farming. It has a land area of 18,450 hectares unevenly distributed to the 22-barangays of the municipality. Its main products are rice, corn, peanut, tobacco and vegetables.\n\nEnrile has a total population of 29,719 inhabitants. Its citizens are called Itawit because they speak the Itawit dialect. Ilocanos and Tagalogs have settled at the western barangays and have blended very well in the mainstream of Itawit life.\n\nEnrile is a community of simple and hardworking people. While Enrile has limited natural resources, it takes pride in its human resources. Almost every family in the community has a member that is of the professional class. Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.\n\n== History ==\nThe History of Enrile dates as early as 1690. According to Father Juan Paguere, it was just a wide and long stretch of virgin land located at the southern most end of the province of Cagayan. In 1718, the Govierno Superior ordered the place to become one of the barrios of Tuguegarao. It was named \u201cCabugag\u201d or in short Cabug, the dialect term for hunchback for the first settler was a man with this deformity. So the place was named after him. The name \u201cCabug\u201d is engraved on the town\u2019s first church bell which is still found in the steeple.\n\nIn 1724, The Dominican Friars have thought of giving the barrios their Patron Saint. Cabug was given \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Caldas\u201d. The old prominent residents of the barrio had chosen the sixth day of August as her feast day. As year went by, the land area and population of the barrio increased with surprising rapidly. The Cagayan River which flowed close to the barrio site gradually changed its course and moved further towards Cataggaman as flood plains were formed. The non Christian inhabitants called Kalingas gradually deserted the barrio and moved westward to the Mountain Province. As a result, more agricultural lands were cleared and cultivated. Tobacco and corn are the chief crops of the people.\n\nIn September 1849, the Govierno Superior ordered the separation of Cabug from the municipality of Tuguegarao to become a town by itself. The new town was named Enrile in honor of Governor Pascual Enrile who was responsible for building roads in the northern part of Luzon during those days. The separation of Enrile from Tuguegarao led to a change of its patron saint. The population unanimously adopted \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Nieves\u201d as its patron Saint. The fifth day of August was selected as her feast day. Since then the feast day had always been celebrated pompously.\n\nAccording to Father Julian Malumbres in his Historia de Cagayan, the name \u201cCabug\u201d was first recorded in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers on January 20, 1849. However the town was known as \u201cCabug\u201d even up 1863 when the name Enrile was officially written and road in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta. Maria, Isabela to the south, by the mighty Cagayan River\u00a0 to the east, by Solana and Tuguegarao to the north, Kalinga to the west.\n\nEnrile is predominantly an agricultural town where the majority of its population derive their income from farming. It has a land area of 18,450 hectares unevenly distributed to the 22-barangays of the municipality. Its main products are rice, corn, peanut, tobacco and vegetables.\n\nEnrile has a total population of 29,719 inhabitants. Its citizens are called Itawit because they speak the Itawit dialect. Ilocanos and Tagalogs have settled at the western barangays and have blended very well in the mainstream of Itawit life.\n\nEnrile is a community of simple and hardworking people. While Enrile has limited natural resources, it takes pride in its human resources. Almost every family in the community has a member that is of the professional class. Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.\n\nIn 1690, the town of Enrile was a virgin forest on the southernmost portion of the province of Cagayan.\n\nIn 1724 or thereabouts, it was named Cabug, a barrio of Tuguegarao City and it now celebrates its feast day on August 6, later changed to August 5, in honor of its Patron Saint Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Caldas.\n\nIn the chronicle of Fray Julian Manumbres, Cabug as a geographical unit was officially recorded on January 20, 1849. And although the name Enrile was officially written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town of Enrile was still known as \u201cCabug\u201d.\n\nKalingas, the early settlers, were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with staple products and tobacco.\n\nWith the increasing production and number of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed \u201cCabug\u201d separated from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Nieves.\n\nThis proclamed \u201cCabug\u201d as \u201cEnrile\u201d in honor of Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the construction of Luzon\u2019s highways.\n\nSinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when they retreated from pursuing American forces.\n\nToday the town of Enrile not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry industry.\n\n== Head of Government ==\n=== Gobernadorcillos ===\nA.

DA Assistant Secretary for Agribusiness Leandro Gazmin, who went to Enrile to represent Alcala during the peanut harvest ceremony, said the soil suitability of the town \u2013 sandy to sandy-loam \u2013 and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round are the \u201cprimary reasons why it will be known as an important source of peanut henceforth.\u201d\n\nGazmin said the Secretary lauds them for their collective effort but that the DA chief requests that they \u201ccommit themselves to improve and develop even further not just the peanut industry but the entire agricultural sector as well.\u201d\n\nHe said the Secretary is also happy to know that farmers have been receptive to new technologies hence, they are able to increase productivity from 1.5 to 1.8 tons per hectare.\n\nDuring the peanut harvest, the DA regional office turned over to the local government of Enrile over P4-million worth of farm machineries and equipment, including one unit four-wheel drive tractor, four units of mill for corngrits, 10 heads of carabao, 2,500 kilos of peanut seeds for planting and 300 bags of open-pollinated corn variety.\n\nThough peanut is considered a high value crop by DA, not just in Enrile but in neighboring towns of Pe\u00f1ablanca and Tuguegarao (Cagayan) and Sta. Maria and Cabagan in Isabela, the former was chosen as \u201cnumber one\u201d for having the \u201chighest production share of 1,800 metric tons per year or 8 to10 percent of the national supply.\u201d\n\nAlso, Enrile is the only municipality that can cultivate peanuts during the dry and wet season cropping, the DA said.\n\nDA Region II Executive Director Lucrecio Alviar said that per cropping, the town of Enrile is able to produce a big chunk of the national production, making it the major source of raw materials for various peanut-based products processed and sold in Metro Manila.\n\nEnrile is home to 800 peanut farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential expansion area of another 800 hectares. \u201cWith improved production and yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons,\u201d Alviar added.\n\nWith the use of technology from DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) \u2013 particularly the use of improved varieties and fertilizers like Boron and Gypsum \u2013 the DA is optimistic that \u201cpeanut production could reach an all-time high of 3.25 tons per hectare,\u201d or an increase of 200 percent over its current average. The DA said it hopes the farmers can sustain their productivity.\n\nGazmin also encouraged peanut farmers to bring their harvest to the Isabela Agri-Pinoy Trading Center, where they can directly sell their produce. The Isabela APTC is part of the government\u2019s effort to empower farmers to become traders to enhance their incomes, stabilize food prices and encourage them to produce more. \u201cLet us utilize the center as a venue for cooperativism\u201d and enabling each other to produce and earn more, he said.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:1Enrile.jpg|alt=|thumb|1 Enrile.

{"title_page": "List of NASCAR video games", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n[[NASCAR]], the most popular motorsport in the United States, has worked with video game developers to design several video games. In 2003, [[EA Sports]] received an exclusive console license to produce [[NASCAR]] games, eliminating [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] and [[Hasbro Interactive]] as competitors. In May 2009, [[iRacing.com]] received a license to run NASCAR-sanctioned online racing starting in 2010. In June 2009 at the E3 Gaming Expo, NASCAR was revealed to be a part of the ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' series for the first time in ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n==Developers==\n\n===Papyrus Design Group===\nIn 1994, [[Papyrus Design Group]], an up-and-coming simulation racing developer (at the time) that was best known for the ''[[IndyCar Racing]]'' series, released the first installation to the NASCAR Racing Series into the video game market.<ref name=ESPN-NTG-Oct2010 /> The game was a huge success. This game, with its revolutionary and dynamic car physics system, changed the image of many people that thought NASCAR was \"just a boring sport where you watched cars make left hand turns all day\".\n\nOver the next decade Papyrus teamed with [[Sierra On-Line|Sierra Entertainment]] and continued producing games for their NASCAR Racing series. The NASCAR Racing games were universally praised for their accuracy in terms of physics and track feel, with NASCAR Cup and [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] (formerly Nationwide) Series drivers regularly practicing for upcoming tracks using the games. [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], [[Denny Hamlin]], and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] still use the game for training.  Prior to sweeping both races at [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]] in 2006, [[Denny Hamlin]] had only seen the track in ''[[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season]]''.\n\n===Electronic Arts===\n[[Electronic Arts]], through their [[EA Sports]] banner, developed NASCAR games for the original [[PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], and [[Nintendo 64]] under names such as ''[[NASCAR 98]]'', ''[[NASCAR 99]]'', ''[[NASCAR 2000]]'' and ''NASCAR Road Racing''. Also, a big hit for the company was ''[[NASCAR Rumble]]'', a spin-off of the normal NASCAR racing games. The company expanded into NASCAR games for PC, Game Boy Color for their 2000 game, and the PlayStation 2 for their 2001 game, the last under the old name. For 2002, the series was renamed ''[[NASCAR Thunder]]'', and by 2003, has simultaneously been released on [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[IBM PC clone|PC]], and the original [[PlayStation]].\n\nEA Sports decided to split their old \"Thunder\" titles into two separate racing lines; one for consoles focused on gameplay, and one for PC, which attempted to focus on technical accuracy in the spirit of the old Papyrus/Sierra lines&nbsp;\u2013 indeed the PC game used many former members of the Papyrus development teams (although David Kaemmer was not involved). The games were given differing names, as to not confuse the two, with the console series renamed ''[[NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup]]'' (released in 2004, a reference to the new NASCAR playoff format) and the PC series renamed ''[[NASCAR SimRacing]]'' (released in 2005). Sweeping gameplay changes meant that the \"Chase for the Cup\" name was dropped from the 2006 edition of the console game. Instead, the game was titled ''[[NASCAR 06: Total Team Control]]''. The new name is derived from the new feature by which a player who has teammates in the field can actually switch to their teammates' cars and control them during a race. It was released on August 30, 2005. Released on September 6, 2006, ''[[NASCAR 07]]'' was EA Sports' tenth game in the series. ''[[NASCAR 09]]'' was the final game in the EA Sports NASCAR series. It is available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well as PlayStation 2. The NASCAR series took a different approach in 2009, as EA introduced ''[[NASCAR Kart Racing]]'' on the Wii console. It was later announced that EA would not make a ''NASCAR 10'', and the series is currently on hiatus because of a drop in sales and now has lost the license they had with NASCAR since 2003.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nStarting in 2010, EA's license to make NASCAR games expired. ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' features NASCAR in the game with cars from 2010 season and some tracks on the NASCAR schedule; 2011 season cars were added later in an update. Also, [[iRacing.com]] and NASCAR started an Online Racing Series which started in 2010 and the NASCAR Peak Antifreeze Series later that year. iRacing and NASCAR have a close partnership and by the start of the 2014 season, the simulation had every car make/model that has run in Sprint Cup from 2013 and 2014 seasons and every track that the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series on the simulation. Other games that came out with NASCAR licensing after 2010 included ''[[Days of Thunder (2010 video game)|Days of Thunder: Arcade]]'' (based on ''[[Days of Thunder]]''), which is a game sold as a Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network game for the Xbox 360 and PS3.\n\n====Eutechnyx====\nIn 2010, it was confirmed that [[Eutechnyx]] will begin creating games based on NASCAR starting in 2011 with ''[[NASCAR The Game: 2011]]''.<ref name=ESPN-NTG-Oct2010>{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Jon|title=NASCAR revs up video game return|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/videogames/blog/_/name/thegamer/id/5630221|website=[[ESPN|espn.go.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=October 4, 2010}}</ref> On May 18, 2012, [[Eutechnyx]] announced that ''[[NASCAR The Game: Inside Line]]'' was released on November 6, 2012. Afterwards, Eutechnyx announced two new games: the first NASCAR licensed video game for [[iOS]], and ''NASCAR The Game: 2013'' for [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. [[Eutechnyx]] switched publishers for ''[[NASCAR '14]]'' to [[Deep Silver]] after having [[Activision]] publishing previous games of the ''NASCAR The Game'' series. DMi Games was announced to replace Eutechnyx for ''NASCAR '15'' on January 1, 2015.\n\n====Dusenberry Martin Racing / 704Games====\nIn January 2015, Dusenberry Martin Racing announced that they will take over the NASCAR license and begin developing new games in 2016, as well as releasing a [[Eutechnyx]]-developed update game for the 2015 season. DMR is an American-based company located in the NASCAR Plaza building in Uptown, Charlotte, North Carolina. The company is headed by former [[Hasbro Interactive]] CEO Tom Dusenberry (developers of the ''[[NASCAR Heat]]'' series) and Ed Martin, former executive at [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]], Hasbro, [[Atari]], [[EA Sports]], and most recent licensee [[Eutechnyx]].<ref name=DMi-openletter-2015>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Ed|title=An open letter to NASCAR fans from DMi|url=http://dmigames.com/letter.html|website=dmigames.com|publisher=DMi Games|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=January 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507090527/http://dmigames.com/letter.html|archive-date=May 7, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Marketwired-DMi-NASCAR-2015>{{cite web|author1=HC2 Holdings, Inc.|title=HC2's Subsidiary DMi, Inc.

This game was based on the ''NASCAR Racing 3'' engine; EA Sports' ''[[NASCAR Revolution]]'' (released between ''[[NASCAR 99]]'', which came out in 1998, and ''[[NASCAR 2000]]'', which came out in 1999); and ''[[NASCAR Rumble]]'', an EA game incorporating some of the features of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, but with NASCAR car designs. On June 3, 2009, at [[Sony]]'s [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] conference, a trailer for the upcoming [[PlayStation 3]] game ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' featured NASCAR as one of several new licenses that was included in the game.<ref>http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-09-gran-turismo/50803</ref>\n\n===List===\n\n====Simulation/realism====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

In 2003, [[EA Sports]] received an exclusive console license to produce [[NASCAR]] games, eliminating [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] and [[Hasbro Interactive]] as competitors. In May 2009, [[iRacing.com]] received a license to run NASCAR-sanctioned online racing starting in 2010. In June 2009 at the E3 Gaming Expo, NASCAR was revealed to be a part of the ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' series for the first time in ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n==Developers==\n\n===Papyrus Design Group===\nIn 1994, [[Papyrus Design Group]], an up-and-coming simulation racing developer (at the time) that was best known for the ''[[IndyCar Racing]]'' series, released the first installation to the NASCAR Racing Series into the video game market.<ref name=ESPN-NTG-Oct2010 /> The game was a huge success. This game, with its revolutionary and dynamic car physics system, changed the image of many people that thought NASCAR was \"just a boring sport where you watched cars make left hand turns all day\".\n\nOver the next decade Papyrus teamed with [[Sierra On-Line|Sierra Entertainment]] and continued producing games for their NASCAR Racing series. The NASCAR Racing games were universally praised for their accuracy in terms of physics and track feel, with NASCAR Cup and [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] (formerly Nationwide) Series drivers regularly practicing for upcoming tracks using the games. [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], [[Denny Hamlin]], and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] still use the game for training.  Prior to sweeping both races at [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]] in 2006, [[Denny Hamlin]] had only seen the track in ''[[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season]]''.\n\n===Electronic Arts===\n[[Electronic Arts]], through their [[EA Sports]] banner, developed NASCAR games for the original [[PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], and [[Nintendo 64]] under names such as ''[[NASCAR 98]]'', ''[[NASCAR 99]]'', ''[[NASCAR 2000]]'' and ''NASCAR Road Racing''. Also, a big hit for the company was ''[[NASCAR Rumble]]'', a spin-off of the normal NASCAR racing games. The company expanded into NASCAR games for PC, Game Boy Color for their 2000 game, and the PlayStation 2 for their 2001 game, the last under the old name. For 2002, the series was renamed ''[[NASCAR Thunder]]'', and by 2003, has simultaneously been released on [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[IBM PC clone|PC]], and the original [[PlayStation]].\n\nEA Sports decided to split their old \"Thunder\" titles into two separate racing lines; one for consoles focused on gameplay, and one for PC, which attempted to focus on technical accuracy in the spirit of the old Papyrus/Sierra lines&nbsp;\u2013 indeed the PC game used many former members of the Papyrus development teams (although David Kaemmer was not involved). The games were given differing names, as to not confuse the two, with the console series renamed ''[[NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup]]'' (released in 2004, a reference to the new NASCAR playoff format) and the PC series renamed ''[[NASCAR SimRacing]]'' (released in 2005). Sweeping gameplay changes meant that the \"Chase for the Cup\" name was dropped from the 2006 edition of the console game. Instead, the game was titled ''[[NASCAR 06: Total Team Control]]''. The new name is derived from the new feature by which a player who has teammates in the field can actually switch to their teammates' cars and control them during a race. It was released on August 30, 2005. Released on September 6, 2006, ''[[NASCAR 07]]'' was EA Sports' tenth game in the series. ''[[NASCAR 09]]'' was the final game in the EA Sports NASCAR series. It is available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well as PlayStation 2. The NASCAR series took a different approach in 2009, as EA introduced ''[[NASCAR Kart Racing]]'' on the Wii console. It was later announced that EA would not make a ''NASCAR 10'', and the series is currently on hiatus because of a drop in sales and now has lost the license they had with NASCAR since 2003.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nStarting in 2010, EA's license to make NASCAR games expired. ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' features NASCAR in the game with cars from 2010 season and some tracks on the NASCAR schedule; 2011 season cars were added later in an update. Also, [[iRacing.com]] and NASCAR started an Online Racing Series which started in 2010 and the NASCAR Peak Antifreeze Series later that year. iRacing and NASCAR have a close partnership and by the start of the 2014 season, the simulation had every car make/model that has run in Sprint Cup from 2013 and 2014 seasons and every track that the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series on the simulation. Other games that came out with NASCAR licensing after 2010 included ''[[Days of Thunder (2010 video game)|Days of Thunder: Arcade]]'' (based on ''[[Days of Thunder]]''), which is a game sold as a Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network game for the Xbox 360 and PS3.\n\n====Eutechnyx====\nIn 2010, it was confirmed that [[Eutechnyx]] will begin creating games based on NASCAR starting in 2011 with ''[[NASCAR The Game: 2011]]''.<ref name=ESPN-NTG-Oct2010>{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Jon|title=NASCAR revs up video game return|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/videogames/blog/_/name/thegamer/id/5630221|website=[[ESPN|espn.go.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=October 4, 2010}}</ref> On May 18, 2012, [[Eutechnyx]] announced that ''[[NASCAR The Game: Inside Line]]'' was released on November 6, 2012.

[[Eutechnyx]] switched publishers for ''[[NASCAR '14]]'' to [[Deep Silver]] after having [[Activision]] publishing previous games of the ''NASCAR The Game'' series. DMi Games was announced to replace Eutechnyx for ''NASCAR '15'' on January 1, 2015.\n\n====Dusenberry Martin Racing / 704Games====\nIn January 2015, Dusenberry Martin Racing announced that they will take over the NASCAR license and begin developing new games in 2016, as well as releasing a [[Eutechnyx]]-developed update game for the 2015 season.

The seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians just as effectively as the organized theocracy of [[Imam Shamil]]. The aristocracy was called ''warq''. Some aristocratic families held the rank of ''Pshi'' or prince and the eldest member of this family was the ''Pshi-tkhamade'' who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to ''tfokotl'', roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the ''warq''.\n\nThey were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three 'democratic' princedoms, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called ''Khase'' or larger ones called ''Zafes''.\n\nDecisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic princedoms, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining 'feudal' princedoms power was theoretically in the hands of the ''Pshi-tkhamade'', although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.\n\nIn addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek ''[[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]''. Many houses would have a ''kunakskaya'' or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to ''abreks'' or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or ''kunaks''. There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called ''tleuzh'' who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an ''atalyk'' or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. ''Adyghe khabze'' is sometimes called ''[[adat]]'' when it is contrasted to the kind of [[Islamic law]] advocated by people like [[Imam Shamil]].\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n[[File:Traditional clothing, Circassian Heritage Center.JPG|thumb|Traditional Circassian clothing]]\n\nThe traditional female clothing ({{lang-ady |\u0411\u0437\u044b\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0428\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Bz\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|bz\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and princedoms. The traditional female costume is composed of a dress ({{lang-ady |\u0414\u0436\u0430\u043d\u044d\u0440, Janer}} {{IPA-ady|d\u0361\u0292a\u02d0nar|}}), coat ({{lang-ady |\u0421\u0430\u0435, Saye}} {{IPA-ady|sa\u02d0ja|}}), shirt, pant ({{lang-ady |\u0414\u0436\u044d\u043d\u044d\u043a\u04c0\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0440, Jene\u00e7'akuer}} {{IPA-ady|d\u0361\u0292anat\u0361\u0283\u02bca\u02d0k\u02b7ar|}}), vest ({{lang-ady |\u041a\u04c0\u044d\u043a\u04c0, \u00c7'e\u00e7'}} {{IPA-ady|t\u0361\u0283\u02bcat\u0361\u0283\u02bc|}}), lamb leather bra ({{lang-ady |\u0428\u044a\u043e\u0445\u044a\u0442\u0430\u043d, \u2c7euex\u0301tan}} {{IPA-ady|\u0282\u02b7a\u03c7ta\u02d0n|}}), a variety of hats ({{lang-ady |\u041f\u044d\u04c0\u043e\u0445\u044d\u0440}, Pe\ua727uexer} {{IPA-ady|pa\u0294\u02b7axar|}}), shoes, and belts ({{lang-ady |\u0411\u0433\u044b\u0440\u044b\u043f\u0445\u044b\u0445\u044d\u0440, B\u011f\u0131r\u0131px\u0131xer}} {{IPA-ady|b\u0263\u0259r\u0259px\u0259xar|}}).\n\nHoliday dresses are made of expensive fabrics such as silk and velvet. The traditional colors of women's clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn. The Circassian dresses were embroidered with gold and silver threads. These embroideries were handmade and took time to complete as they were very intricate.\n\nThe traditional male costume ({{lang-ady |\u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044a\u0443\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0448\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Ad\u0131\u011fe X\u0301u\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|a\u02d0d\u0259\u0263a \u03c7\u02b7\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors\u2019 times wore coat with short sleeves\u2014in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn).\n\nA compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called ''[[shashka]]''. It is a special kind of [[sabre]]; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and [[Hilt|guardless]] sword. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word \"Sashkhwa\" ({{lang-ady |\u0421\u0430\u0448\u044c\u0445\u044a\u0443\u044d, Sas\u0328x\u0301ue}}) which means \"long knife\". On the breast of the costume are long ornamental tubes or sticks, once filled with a single charge of gunpowder (called gaziri cartridges) and used to reload muskets.\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n[[File:Old Circassian traditional house.jpg|thumb|An old country house and traditional cuisine with [[Haliva]] (\u0425\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240wa) and [[Mataz]] (\u041c\u044d\u0442\u0430\u0437\u044d, Metaze), two of the prominent traditional Adyghe snacks.]]\n\nThe Adyghe cuisine is rich with different dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yHeq6UZxf8 |title=Jordanian Cuisine(Bedouins, Circassians, & Palestinians)(\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629) |publisher=YouTube |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Ref_ac\">{{cite web|editor=Amjad Jaimoukha|editor-link=Amjad Jaimoukha|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|title=Circassian Cuisine|publisher=Circassianworld.com|accessdate=20 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306214324/http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref> In the summer, the traditional dishes consumed by the Adyghe people are mainly dairy products and vegetable dishes. In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly flour and meat dishes. An example of the latter is known as ''[[ficcin]]''.\n\n[[Circassian cheese]] is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the [[North Caucasus]].\n\nA popular traditional dish is chicken or turkey with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.\n\nVariants of pasta are found. A type of ravioli may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.\n\nOn holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make ''[[haliva]]'' ({{lang-ady|\u0445\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240ua}}) (fried triangular pastries with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies.

The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its{{clarify|date=September 2014}} colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by [[Populus|poplar]] leaves ({{lang-ady| \u0435\u043a\u04cf\u044d\u043f\u0446\u04cf\u044d, Ye\u00e7'epc'e}} {{IPA-ady|jat\u0361\u0283\u02bcapt\u0361s\u02bca|}}).\n\nThe carpets were adorned with images of birds, beloved animals (horses), and plants, and the image of the Sun was widely used.\n\nThe carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to humidity and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over rifles ({{lang-ady| \u0448\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0447\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, \u015exuen\u00e7\u0131mre}} {{IPA-ady|\u0283x\u02b7ant\u0361\u0283\u0259mra|}}) and pistols ({{lang-ady| \u043a\u044a\u044d\u043b\u0430\u0435\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, Qelaye\u0131mre}}), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.\n\nThe carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before marriage][[prayer rug]].

They had slightly different dialects.\n\nDialects came to exist after Circassia was divided into princedoms (tribes) after the death of [[Inal of Kabardia]], who united Circassia for the last time before its short reunion during the Russo-Caucasian War. As the logistics between the princedoms became harder, each princedom became slightly isolated from one another, thus the people living under the banner of each princedom developed their own dialects. In time, the dialects they speak were named after their princedoms. After a longer while, the people began being called after the princedom which they live under the banner of. Therefore, there is a widespread misconception of these princedoms actually being tribes. Opposed to that, the notion \"tribe\" is non-existent in the Circassian culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Caucasian War]] most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, and many of the princedoms were destroyed and the people evicted from their historical homeland in 1864.\n\nThe main groups within the Circassian people are the [[Adygeans]], [[Abzakh people|Abzakh]], [[Kabardians]], and [[Cherkess]]. This does not include tribal subgroups.\n\nMost Adyghe living in [[Circassia]] are Bzhedug, Kabardian, and Temirgoy, while the majority in [[Circassian diaspora|diaspora]] are Kabardian, Abdzakh, and Shapsug. West Adyghe language is based on Temirgoy dialect, while East Adyghe language is based on Kabardian dialect.\n\nThe twelve stars on the Circassian flag symbolize the individual tribes of the Circassians; the nine stars within the arc symbolize the nine aristocratic tribes of Adygea, and the three horizontal stars symbolize the three democratic tribes.

The Kabarda occupied about a third of the north Caucasus piedmont from east of Circassia proper eastward to the Chechen country. To their north were the Nogai nomads and to the south, deeper in the mountains, were from west to east, the Karachays, Balkars, Ossetes, Ingushes, and Chechens. The Kabardians were fairly advanced, interacted with the Russians from the sixteenth century and were much reduced by plague in the early nineteenth century.\n\n{{Location map+|Russia Krasnodar Krai|width=450px|float=right|relief=1|thumb|caption=Approximate location of Circassian princedoms, Tsutsiev's Atlas\n|places=\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.50|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=top|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=40.30|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=right|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=39.45|label='''{{small|Adamey}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.85|long=40.40|label='''[[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b|Yegeruqwai]]'''|position=right|mark=White pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.70|long=40.60|label='''{{small|Makhosh}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=41.50|label='''[[Besleney]]'''|mark=Yellow pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.10|long=41.75|label='''[[Kabardians|Kabardian]]'''[[File:Pfeil rechts.svg|10px]]|position=bottom|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.14|long=38.08|label='''[[Kabardians|Kuban&nbsp;Kabardian]]'''|position=top|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.25|label='''[[Hatuqwai]]'''|position=left|mark=Yellow ffff00 pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=38.60|label='''[[Bzhedug]]'''|mark=Purple pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.30|long=36.80|label='''{{small|Adele}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.10|long=37.40|label=|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.12|long=36.70|label='''[[Zhaney]]'''|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=37.30|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.50|label=|position=right|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=38.25|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|position=bottom|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.62|long=38.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=39.40|label=|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=39.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|position=left|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.62|long=39.70|label='''[[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]'''|position=top|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.95|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.30|long=38.75|label=|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.90|long=39.45|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.50|long=39.50|label='''[[Mamkhegh]]'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.75|long=37.30|label='''{{small|Shegak}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.00|long=41.20|label=[[Abazin]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=42.00|label={{small|Tapanta}}|background=PowderBlue|mark=Pfeil rechts.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.20|long=41.30|label=[[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.86|long=37.37|label=Anapa-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.66|long=37.79|label=Novorossisk-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.54|long=38.05|label=Gelendzhik-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.12|long=39.07|label=Tuapse-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.58|long=39.73|label=Sochi-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.33|long=40.22|label=Gagra-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n}}\nAs for the Circassians proper, apparently called Kiakhs, some writers speak of twelve princedoms and some do not.\n*The narrow '''Black Sea coast''' was occupied, from north to south by the [[Natukhai]], [[Shapsug]], Ubykh, and the [[Sadz]]  The main part of the Natukhai and Shapsug princedoms located in north of the mountains. The Natukhai were enriched by trade since their coast was not backed by high mountains and opened onto the steppe.\n* The '''north slope''' was inhabited, from north to south, by the Natukhai, Shapsug, Abdzakh, and Abaza. They seem to have been the most populous princedoms after the Kabarda and its inland location gave then some protection from Nogai and Cossack raiding.\n* In the '''far west''' were three small princedoms that were absorbed into the Natukhai and disappeared. These were the Adele [[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435]] on the Taman peninsula and the Shegak and Chebsin ([[:ru:\u0425\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0438]] and [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0441\u0438\u043d]]) near Anapa.\n* Along the '''Kuban''' were the Natukhai, Zhaney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, and Temirgoy.\n* On the '''east''', between the Laba and Belaya, from north to south, were the Temirgoy, Yegeruqwai ([[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), Makhosh ([[:ru:\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), [[Besleney]] and Abaza. The Besleney were a branch of the Kabardians. The Tapanta ([[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430]]), a branch of the Abaza, lived between the Besleney and Kabardian princedoms on the upper Kuban. Along the Belaya River were the Temirgoy, the ill-documented Ademey ([[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b]]) and then the [[Mamkhegh]] near the modern [[Maykop]].\n*The Guaye ([[:ru:\u0413\u0443\u0430\u0439\u0435]]) are poorly documented. The Tchelugay lived west of the Makhosh. The Hakuch lived on the coast south of the Natukhai. Other groups are mentioned without much documentation. There are reports of princedoms migrating from one place to another, again without much documentation. Some sketch maps show a group of [[Karachays]] on the upper Laba without any explanation.\n\nThe princedoms along the Kuban and Laba rivers were exposed to Nogai and Cossack raiding while those in the interior had some protection. The three \"democratic\" princedoms were the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They managed their affairs by assemblies while the other princedoms were controlled by \"princes\" or ''Pshi''. Princedoms with remnants in the Caucasus are: Kabarda (the largest), the Temirgoy and Bzhedug in Adygea, and the Shapsug near Tuapse and to the north of Tuapsiysiy Rayon of Krasnodarskiy Kray. There are also a few Besleney and Natukhai villages, and an Abdzakh village.\n\n==Circassian diaspora==\n{{Main|Circassian diaspora}}\n[[File:\u00c7erkez s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\u00fcn\u00fcn an\u0131lmas\u0131 1.jpg|thumb|Circassians commemorate the banishment of the Circassians from Russia in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\nMuch of Adyghe culture was disrupted after the conquest of their homeland by Russia]in 1864. The Circassian people were subjected to [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|ethnic cleansing]] and mass exile mainly to the Ottoman Empire, and to a lesser extent [[Qajar Iran]] and the Balkans.

At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Richmond|first= Walter\n|title= The Circassian Genocide\n|year= 2013\n|publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]]\n|page= back cover|nopp= y\n|isbn= 978-0-8135-6069-4\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LHlwZwpA70cC\n}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Post-exile period===\nThe Adyghe whom the Ottomans settled in various near-border settlements across the Ottoman Empire ended up living across many territories in the Middle East.

The Abkhazians lived on the coast between the Circassians and the Georgians, were organized as the [[Principality of Abkhazia]] and were involved with the Georgians to some degree. The Abazins or Abaza, their relatives, lived north of the mountains and were involved with Circassia proper.

The seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians just as effectively as the organized theocracy of [[Imam Shamil]]. The aristocracy was called ''warq''. Some aristocratic families held the rank of ''Pshi'' or prince and the eldest member of this family was the ''Pshi-tkhamade'' who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to ''tfokotl'', roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the ''warq''.\n\nThey were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three 'democratic' princedoms, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called ''Khase'' or larger ones called ''Zafes''.\n\nDecisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic princedoms, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining 'feudal' princedoms power was theoretically in the hands of the ''Pshi-tkhamade'', although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.\n\nIn addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek ''[[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]''. Many houses would have a ''kunakskaya'' or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to ''abreks'' or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or ''kunaks''. There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called ''tleuzh'' who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an ''atalyk'' or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. ''Adyghe khabze'' is sometimes called ''[[adat]]'' when it is contrasted to the kind of [[Islamic law]] advocated by people like [[Imam Shamil]].\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n[[File:Traditional clothing, Circassian Heritage Center.JPG|thumb|Traditional Circassian clothing]]\n\nThe traditional female clothing ({{lang-ady |\u0411\u0437\u044b\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0428\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Bz\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|bz\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and princedoms.

The traditional colors of women's clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn. The Circassian dresses were embroidered with gold and silver threads. These embroideries were handmade and took time to complete as they were very intricate.\n\nThe traditional male costume ({{lang-ady |\u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044a\u0443\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0448\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Ad\u0131\u011fe X\u0301u\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|a\u02d0d\u0259\u0263a \u03c7\u02b7\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors\u2019 times wore coat with short sleeves\u2014in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn).\n\nA compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called ''[[shashka]]''. It is a special kind of [[sabre]]; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and [[Hilt|guardless]] sword. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word \"Sashkhwa\" ({{lang-ady |\u0421\u0430\u0448\u044c\u0445\u044a\u0443\u044d, Sas\u0328x\u0301ue}}) which means \"long knife\". On the breast of the costume are long ornamental tubes or sticks, once filled with a single charge of gunpowder (called gaziri cartridges) and used to reload muskets.\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n[[File:Old Circassian traditional house.jpg|thumb|An old country house and traditional cuisine with [[Haliva]] (\u0425\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240wa) and [[Mataz]] (\u041c\u044d\u0442\u0430\u0437\u044d, Metaze), two of the prominent traditional Adyghe snacks.]]\n\nThe Adyghe cuisine is rich with different dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yHeq6UZxf8 |title=Jordanian Cuisine(Bedouins, Circassians, & Palestinians)(\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629) |publisher=YouTube |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Ref_ac\">{{cite web|editor=Amjad Jaimoukha|editor-link=Amjad Jaimoukha|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|title=Circassian Cuisine|publisher=Circassianworld.com|accessdate=20 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306214324/http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref> In the summer, the traditional dishes consumed by the Adyghe people are mainly dairy products and vegetable dishes. In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly flour and meat dishes. An example of the latter is known as ''[[ficcin]]''.\n\n[[Circassian cheese]] is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the [[North Caucasus]].\n\nA popular traditional dish is chicken or turkey with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.\n\nVariants of pasta are found. A type of ravioli may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.\n\nOn holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make ''[[haliva]]'' ({{lang-ady|\u0445\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240ua}}) (fried triangular pastries with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies.

The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its{{clarify|date=September 2014}} colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by [[Populus|poplar]] leaves ({{lang-ady| \u0435\u043a\u04cf\u044d\u043f\u0446\u04cf\u044d, Ye\u00e7'epc'e}} {{IPA-ady|jat\u0361\u0283\u02bcapt\u0361s\u02bca|}}).\n\nThe carpets were adorned with images of birds, beloved animals (horses), and plants, and the image of the Sun was widely used.\n\nThe carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to humidity and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over rifles ({{lang-ady| \u0448\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0447\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, \u015exuen\u00e7\u0131mre}} {{IPA-ady|\u0283x\u02b7ant\u0361\u0283\u0259mra|}}) and pistols ({{lang-ady| \u043a\u044a\u044d\u043b\u0430\u0435\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, Qelaye\u0131mre}}), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.\n\nThe carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before marriage][[prayer rug]].

They had slightly different dialects.\n\nDialects came to exist after Circassia was divided into princedoms (tribes) after the death of [[Inal of Kabardia]], who united Circassia for the last time before its short reunion during the Russo-Caucasian War. As the logistics between the princedoms became harder, each princedom became slightly isolated from one another, thus the people living under the banner of each princedom developed their own dialects. In time, the dialects they speak were named after their princedoms. After a longer while, the people began being called after the princedom which they live under the banner of. Therefore, there is a widespread misconception of these princedoms actually being tribes. Opposed to that, the notion \"tribe\" is non-existent in the Circassian culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Caucasian War]] most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, and many of the princedoms were destroyed and the people evicted from their historical homeland in 1864.\n\nThe main groups within the Circassian people are the [[Adygeans]], [[Abzakh people|Abzakh]], [[Kabardians]], and [[Cherkess]]. This does not include tribal subgroups.\n\nMost Adyghe living in [[Circassia]] are Bzhedug, Kabardian, and Temirgoy, while the majority in [[Circassian diaspora|diaspora]] are Kabardian, Abdzakh, and Shapsug. West Adyghe language is based on Temirgoy dialect, while East Adyghe language is based on Kabardian dialect.\n\nThe twelve stars on the Circassian flag symbolize the individual tribes of the Circassians; the nine stars within the arc symbolize the nine aristocratic tribes of Adygea, and the three horizontal stars symbolize the three democratic tribes. The twelve tribes are the Abdzakh, Besleney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Kabardian, Mamkhegh, Natukhai, Shapsug, Temirgoy, Ubykh, Yegeruqwai, and Zhaney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adiga-home.net/Circassians.htm|title=Circassians|publisher=adiga-home.net|accessdate=20 August 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820015838/https://www.adiga-home.net/Circassians.htm|archivedate=20 August 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ | Twelve Circassian (Adyghe) tribes (sub-ethnic groups)\n|-\n!Geographical designation\n!Main dialect\n!Tribe<ref name=Brill>\"\u010cerkesses\".

The Kabarda occupied about a third of the north Caucasus piedmont from east of Circassia proper eastward to the Chechen country. To their north were the Nogai nomads and to the south, deeper in the mountains, were from west to east, the Karachays, Balkars, Ossetes, Ingushes, and Chechens. The Kabardians were fairly advanced, interacted with the Russians from the sixteenth century and were much reduced by plague in the early nineteenth century.\n\n{{Location map+|Russia Krasnodar Krai|width=450px|float=right|relief=1|thumb|caption=Approximate location of Circassian princedoms, Tsutsiev's Atlas\n|places=\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.50|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=top|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=40.30|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=right|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=39.45|label='''{{small|Adamey}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.85|long=40.40|label='''[[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b|Yegeruqwai]]'''|position=right|mark=White pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.70|long=40.60|label='''{{small|Makhosh}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=41.50|label='''[[Besleney]]'''|mark=Yellow pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.10|long=41.75|label='''[[Kabardians|Kabardian]]'''[[File:Pfeil rechts.svg|10px]]|position=bottom|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.14|long=38.08|label='''[[Kabardians|Kuban&nbsp;Kabardian]]'''|position=top|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.25|label='''[[Hatuqwai]]'''|position=left|mark=Yellow ffff00 pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=38.60|label='''[[Bzhedug]]'''|mark=Purple pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.30|long=36.80|label='''{{small|Adele}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.10|long=37.40|label=|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.12|long=36.70|label='''[[Zhaney]]'''|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=37.30|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.50|label=|position=right|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=38.25|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|position=bottom|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.62|long=38.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=39.40|label=|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=39.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|position=left|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.62|long=39.70|label='''[[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]'''|position=top|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.95|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.30|long=38.75|label=|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.90|long=39.45|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.50|long=39.50|label='''[[Mamkhegh]]'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.75|long=37.30|label='''{{small|Shegak}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.00|long=41.20|label=[[Abazin]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=42.00|label={{small|Tapanta}}|background=PowderBlue|mark=Pfeil rechts.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.20|long=41.30|label=[[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.86|long=37.37|label=Anapa-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.66|long=37.79|label=Novorossisk-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.54|long=38.05|label=Gelendzhik-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.12|long=39.07|label=Tuapse-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.58|long=39.73|label=Sochi-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.33|long=40.22|label=Gagra-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n}}\nAs for the Circassians proper, apparently called Kiakhs, some writers speak of twelve princedoms and some do not.\n*The narrow '''Black Sea coast''' was occupied, from north to south by the [[Natukhai]], [[Shapsug]], Ubykh, and the [[Sadz]]  The main part of the Natukhai and Shapsug princedoms located in north of the mountains. The Natukhai were enriched by trade since their coast was not backed by high mountains and opened onto the steppe.\n* The '''north slope''' was inhabited, from north to south, by the Natukhai, Shapsug, Abdzakh, and Abaza. They seem to have been the most populous princedoms after the Kabarda and its inland location gave then some protection from Nogai and Cossack raiding.\n* In the '''far west''' were three small princedoms that were absorbed into the Natukhai and disappeared. These were the Adele [[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435]] on the Taman peninsula and the Shegak and Chebsin ([[:ru:\u0425\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0438]] and [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0441\u0438\u043d]]) near Anapa.\n* Along the '''Kuban''' were the Natukhai, Zhaney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, and Temirgoy.\n* On the '''east''', between the Laba and Belaya, from north to south, were the Temirgoy, Yegeruqwai ([[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), Makhosh ([[:ru:\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), [[Besleney]] and Abaza. The Besleney were a branch of the Kabardians. The Tapanta ([[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430]]), a branch of the Abaza, lived between the Besleney and Kabardian princedoms on the upper Kuban. Along the Belaya River were the Temirgoy, the ill-documented Ademey ([[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b]]) and then the [[Mamkhegh]] near the modern [[Maykop]].\n*The Guaye ([[:ru:\u0413\u0443\u0430\u0439\u0435]]) are poorly documented. The Tchelugay lived west of the Makhosh. The Hakuch lived on the coast south of the Natukhai. Other groups are mentioned without much documentation. There are reports of princedoms migrating from one place to another, again without much documentation. Some sketch maps show a group of [[Karachays]] on the upper Laba without any explanation.\n\nThe princedoms along the Kuban and Laba rivers were exposed to Nogai and Cossack raiding while those in the interior had some protection. The three \"democratic\" princedoms were the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They managed their affairs by assemblies while the other princedoms were controlled by \"princes\" or ''Pshi''. Princedoms with remnants in the Caucasus are: Kabarda (the largest), the Temirgoy and Bzhedug in Adygea, and the Shapsug near Tuapse and to the north of Tuapsiysiy Rayon of Krasnodarskiy Kray. There are also a few Besleney and Natukhai villages, and an Abdzakh village.\n\n==Circassian diaspora==\n{{Main|Circassian diaspora}}\n[[File:\u00c7erkez s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\u00fcn\u00fcn an\u0131lmas\u0131 1.jpg|thumb|Circassians commemorate the banishment of the Circassians from Russia in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\nMuch of Adyghe culture was disrupted after the conquest of their homeland by Russia]in 1864. The Circassian people were subjected to [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|ethnic cleansing]] and mass exile mainly to the Ottoman Empire, and to a lesser extent [[Qajar Iran]] and the Balkans.

He went on to finish the race in 4th place. After another 4th place finish in the [[2019 United States Grand Prix|United States]], a controversial collision with teammate Vettel caused Leclerc's third retirement of the season in [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], ending both drivers' races.

During his first season at Ferrari, he recorded ten podium finishes, two wins, four fastest laps and the most pole positions of any driver that season, with seven. Leclerc therefore became the first non-Mercedes driver to win the [[Pole position#Pole position trophy|Pole Position Award]].

He went on to finish the race in 4th place. After another 4th place finish in the [[2019 United States Grand Prix|United States]], a controversial collision with teammate Vettel caused Leclerc's third retirement of the season in [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], ending both drivers' races.

During his first season at Ferrari, he recorded ten podium finishes, two wins, four fastest laps and the most pole positions of any driver that season, with seven. Leclerc therefore became the first non-Mercedes driver to win the [[Pole position#Pole position trophy|Pole Position Award]].

In [[2018 British Grand Prix|Britain]], Verstappen was plagued by issues, finishing the first practice session early due to a gearbox problem and crashing in the second practice session before retiring from the race due to a brake problem. He would then finish 4th in [[2018 German Grand Prix|Germany]] after strategy errors let a recovering Hamilton get past him as he went on to win the race. Verstappen ended the first half of the season with a retirement in [[2018 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] and was narrowly behind his teammate in the championship due to his own recent resurgence and Ricciardo's unreliability.\n\nVerstappen enjoyed a very strong second half of the season, achieving podium finishes at [[2018 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], [[2018 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]], [[2018 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] and the [[2018 United States Grand Prix|USA]], the latter of which he achieved 2nd place having started from 18th on the grid due to a suspension failure in qualifying.

However, he was hit by [[Force India]] driver [[Esteban Ocon]] who was trying to unlap himself on faster tyres.

Verstappen qualified in 4th and finished 3rd in [[2019 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], the first podium finish for a [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]]-powered car since the [[2008 British Grand Prix]]. Verstappen was on course for a second 3rd-place finish in [[2019 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] before a late safety car prevented him from overtaking Charles Leclerc's ailing Ferrari, keeping him in 4th place. Two more 4th-place finishes followed in [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix|China]] and [[2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix|Azerbaijan]], before a second podium came as he finished 3rd in [[2019 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]. In [[2019 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], Verstappen qualified in 3rd place. He was released into the path of Valtteri Bottas during the drivers' pit stops, gaining 2nd place but receiving a 5-second penalty as a result. Verstappen crossed the line in 2nd place but was demoted to 4th by the penalty.\n\nIn [[2019 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], Verstappen's final lap in the second qualifying session was hampered by a red flag brought out by [[Kevin Magnussen]]'s crash. This caused Verstappen to qualify 11th and start the race in 9th place. He later recovered to finish 5th. In [[2019 French Grand Prix|France]] he started and finished in 4th place. In [[2019 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]], Verstappen started 2nd but suffered a poor start, dropping down to 8th. After a charge towards the front, he made his way up to 2nd before controversially passing Leclerc for the lead of the race with three laps to go. This marked the first Honda-powered race victory since the [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix]]. In [[2019 British Grand Prix|Britain]], Verstappen, running in 3rd place, was hit from behind during an overtake attempt by Sebastian Vettel and spun into the gravel. Verstappen was able to continue and crossed the line in 5th place. \n\nThe wet and chaotic [[2019 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] began in a similar fashion to the race in Austria for Verstappen, as a poor start caused him to fall behind. However, he would inherit the lead mid-way through the race after a crash by race leader Hamilton. Verstappen would go on to extend his lead after the track began to dry, claiming his second victory of the season. In [[2019 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], he claimed the first pole position of his career, and led most of the race before being passed in the closing laps by Hamilton, who had made another stop for fresh tyres in a gamble to catch the leader. By the summer break, Verstappen's strong performances in the first half of the season made some consider him an outside contender for the championship. \n[[File:F\u00f3rmula 1 \u2013 Grande Pr\u00eamio do Brasil de F1 2019 (49080565726).jpg|thumb|right|Verstappen on the podium after winning the [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nPrior to the [[2019 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], Verstappen received a new teammate in [[Alexander Albon]] after Pierre Gasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso. In the race, Verstappen had a poor start and collided with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen at the first corner, resulting in suspension damage and causing Verstappen's first retirement of the season. In [[2019 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], he did not set a time during qualifying as he would already be required to start from the back of the grid due to an engine component penalty. After damaging his front wing on the first lap, he recovered to finish the race in 8th place. 3rd and 4th place finishes followed in [[2019 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]] and [[2019 Russian Grand Prix|Russia]] respectively. After suffering damage in a first-lap collision with Charles Leclerc in [[2019 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], Verstappen suffered his 2nd retirement of the season. \n\nIn [[2019 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], he qualified in 1st place before being handed a grid penalty for ignoring [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow flags]] after a crash by Valtteri Bottas. Verstappen suffered a puncture early in the race after making contact with Bottas, falling to the back of the field before eventually recovering to 6th place. A 3rd place finish in the [[2019 United States Grand Prix|United States]] followed, before Verstappen took the second pole position of his career with a 1:07.508 pole lap time in [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]. In a chaotic race, he passed Lewis Hamilton for the lead on two separate occasions before going on to claim his third victory of the season. Verstappen ended the season with a 2nd-place finish in [[2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]].\n\nVerstappen finished the 2019 season in 3rd place in the championship with 278 points, the best result of his career thus far.

Verstappen was on course for a second 3rd-place finish in [[2019 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] before a late safety car prevented him from overtaking Charles Leclerc's ailing Ferrari, keeping him in 4th place. Two more 4th-place finishes followed in [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix|China]] and [[2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix|Azerbaijan]], before a second podium came as he finished 3rd in [[2019 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]. In [[2019 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], Verstappen qualified in 3rd place. He was released into the path of Valtteri Bottas during the drivers' pit stops, gaining 2nd place but receiving a 5-second penalty as a result. Verstappen crossed the line in 2nd place but was demoted to 4th by the penalty.\n\nIn [[2019 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], Verstappen's final lap in the second qualifying session was hampered by a red flag brought out by [[Kevin Magnussen]]'s crash. This caused Verstappen to qualify 11th and start the race in 9th place. He later recovered to finish 5th. In [[2019 French Grand Prix|France]] he started and finished in 4th place. In [[2019 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]], Verstappen started 2nd but suffered a poor start, dropping down to 8th. After a charge towards the front, he made his way up to 2nd before controversially passing Leclerc for the lead of the race with three laps to go. This marked the first Honda-powered race victory since the [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix]]. In [[2019 British Grand Prix|Britain]], Verstappen, running in 3rd place, was hit from behind during an overtake attempt by Sebastian Vettel and spun into the gravel. Verstappen was able to continue and crossed the line in 5th place. \n\nThe wet and chaotic [[2019 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] began in a similar fashion to the race in Austria for Verstappen, as a poor start caused him to fall behind. However, he would inherit the lead mid-way through the race after a crash by race leader Hamilton. Verstappen would go on to extend his lead after the track began to dry, claiming his second victory of the season. In [[2019 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], he claimed the first pole position of his career, and led most of the race before being passed in the closing laps by Hamilton, who had made another stop for fresh tyres in a gamble to catch the leader. By the summer break, Verstappen's strong performances in the first half of the season made some consider him an outside contender for the championship. \n[[File:F\u00f3rmula 1 \u2013 Grande Pr\u00eamio do Brasil de F1 2019 (49080565726).jpg|thumb|right|Verstappen on the podium after winning the [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nPrior to the [[2019 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], Verstappen received a new teammate in [[Alexander Albon]] after Pierre Gasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso.

In [[2019 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], he did not set a time during qualifying as he would already be required to start from the back of the grid due to an engine component penalty. After damaging his front wing on the first lap, he recovered to finish the race in 8th place. 3rd and 4th place finishes followed in [[2019 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]] and [[2019 Russian Grand Prix|Russia]] respectively. After suffering damage in a first-lap collision with Charles Leclerc in [[2019 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], Verstappen suffered his 2nd retirement of the season. \n\nIn [[2019 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], he qualified in 1st place before being handed a grid penalty for ignoring [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow flags]] after a crash by Valtteri Bottas.
