It occurred in [[Dennewitz]], a village in the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Brandenburg]], near [[J\u00fcterbog]], {{convert|40|km}} southwest of [[Berlin]].\n\n==Prelude==\nIn late August 1813, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] decided to order a general offensive to take [[Berlin]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] capital, with the overall goal of knocking the Prussians out of the war. Berlin and its environs was defended by the Coalition's Army of the North, composed of Prussian, Russian and Swedish troops, under the command of [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden]] (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte). [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot|Oudinot]]'s [[corps]] advanced towards this objective along three separate roads. The heavy fighting that took place on 23 August was essentially three isolated actions at Blankenfield, Grossbeeren, and Sputendorf, but is known as the [[Battle of Grossbeeren]]. In each case the Allies prevailed and Oudinot retreated to [[Wittenberg]]. At this point Napoleon appointed Marshal [[Michel Ney]] to command.\n\n==Battle==\nNey, with around 58,000 men, renewed the advance on Berlin on 6 September, but moving first easterwards in order to advance on Berlin from the Southeast. This was because he mistakenly expected Napoleon, away to the southeast near Dresden, to support him from this direction. Coalition forces were established in a defensive disposition wherein any Allied corps that came into contact with the main French thrust were to engage and hold them in order to gain time for the rest of the army to arrive and administer the killing blow. He encountered mixed elements of Prussian, Russian, and Swedish troops of the Allied Army of the North, under the overall command of [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden]] (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte) at [[Dennewitz]]. Ney had decided to move his entire army down a single road and was shadowed to the north by B\u00fclow's III Corps. While this allowed Ney to maintain communications with his entire army, the single road stacked his army for miles. As a result, the battle swayed back and forth with the arrival of fresh French and Allied reinforcements throughout its course.\n\nThe Prussian General Tauentzien was at J\u00fcterbog, blocking Ney's route to Berlin. Ney's troops reached Dennewitz as B\u00fclow was approaching J\u00fcterbog along an eastward route to their north. To keep Tuentzien and B\u00fclow from uniting, the French occupied the heights north of Dennewitz now known as the Denkmalsberg (Monument Hill). Despite early damage done to Tauentzien's Corps, B\u00fclow saved the situation by taking the hill. This was followed by a charge of the [[Dragoons|Brandenburg Dragoons]] down the hill. This gave time for the Prussian units which had earlier wavered to regroup.\n\n[[Image:Dennewitz Denkmal Buelow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]] memorial]]\nThere were signs that all was not well in the [[French army]] at this time. The French empire was seriously short of [[cavalry]] troops and mounts since the 1812 Russian campaign. As a result, there was a lack of screening and [[reconnaissance]].\nThe French command situation was also strained, as Oudinot was angered at being placed under Ney's command. Marshal Ney was determined to advance with all haste to Berlin and this, combined with the poor reconnaissance, allowed the French army to walk right into an assembled Allied defense.\nInitially forced back, the Prussian elements of Bernadotte's army were reinforced by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]] and recovered the lost ground. B\u00fclow would now assume command of the allied side for most of the remainder of the day.\n\nA see-sawing battle now developed, but just as the French appeared on the verge of a victory, Ney, hindered by a lack of support from Oudinot, made a mistake that swung the battle.\nHaving joined in the fighting personally and being unaware of the tactical situation due to a rainstorm on the battlefield, Ney ordered Oudinot to form a reserve. This pull back by Oudinot was perceived as a retreat and the Allies redoubled the attack.\n\nUnder great pressure, the French were forced back. It was at this time that Bernadotte arrived with the remainder of the Army of the North, including his Swedish Corps, on the French left flank and proceeded to attack with seventy fresh battalions.<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket. ''Bernadotte: Prince and King.'' Pp. 91-92. John Murray, London. 1925.</ref> The French, already falling back under heavy pressure, were utterly routed. The French suffered 10,000 casualties, the Allies some 11,000.\n\n[[Image:Dennewitz Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Memorial of the battle, built by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkel]]]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[Bavaria]] withdrew from the war as a result of the failure of the Berlin campaign. Other German states were now wavering in their support of the French Empire. Playing on this wave of German nationalism, Bernadotte issued a proclamation that invited the Saxon Army, whom he was personally popular with as he had commanded them during the [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram Campaign]] of 1809, to defect from the French cause and join his army. A month later the Saxons accepted Bernadotte's invitation and switched sides at a crucial moment during the [[Battle of Leipzig]], dooming the French to defeat. For his superb generalship and courage during the battle, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|Friedrich Wilhelm von B\u00fclow]] was awarded the Grand Cross of the Swedish [[Order of the Sword]] on the battlefield by Bernadotte and was subsequently ennobled as Graf von Dennewitz by the King of Prussia.<ref>Ibid.

It occurred in [[Dennewitz]], a village in the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Brandenburg]], near [[J\u00fcterbog]], {{convert|40|km}} southwest of [[Berlin]].\n\n==Prelude==\nIn late August 1813, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] decided to order a general offensive to take [[Berlin]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] capital, with the overall goal of knocking the Prussians out of the war. Berlin and its environs was defended by the Coalition's Army of the North, composed of Prussian, Russian and Swedish troops, under the command of [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden]] (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte). [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot|Oudinot]]'s [[corps]] advanced towards this objective along three separate roads. The heavy fighting that took place on 23 August was essentially three isolated actions at Blankenfield, Grossbeeren, and Sputendorf, but is known as the [[Battle of Grossbeeren]]. In each case the Allies prevailed and Oudinot retreated to [[Wittenberg]]. At this point Napoleon appointed Marshal [[Michel Ney]] to command.\n\n==Battle==\nNey, with around 58,000 men, renewed the advance on Berlin on 6 September, but moving first easterwards in order to advance on Berlin from the Southeast. This was because he mistakenly expected Napoleon, away to the southeast near Dresden, to support him from this direction. Coalition forces were established in a defensive disposition wherein any Allied corps that came into contact with the main French thrust were to engage and hold them in order to gain time for the rest of the army to arrive and administer the killing blow. He encountered mixed elements of Prussian, Russian, and Swedish troops of the Allied Army of the North, under the overall command of [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden]] (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte) at [[Dennewitz]]. Ney had decided to move his entire army down a single road and was shadowed to the north by B\u00fclow's III Corps. While this allowed Ney to maintain communications with his entire army, the single road stacked his army for miles. As a result, the battle swayed back and forth with the arrival of fresh French and Allied reinforcements throughout its course.\n\nThe Prussian General Tauentzien was at J\u00fcterbog, blocking Ney's route to Berlin. Ney's troops reached Dennewitz as B\u00fclow was approaching J\u00fcterbog along an eastward route to their north. To keep Tuentzien and B\u00fclow from uniting, the French occupied the heights north of Dennewitz now known as the Denkmalsberg (Monument Hill). Despite early damage done to Tauentzien's Corps, B\u00fclow saved the situation by taking the hill. This was followed by a charge of the [[Dragoons|Brandenburg Dragoons]] down the hill. This gave time for the Prussian units which had earlier wavered to regroup.\n\n[[Image:Dennewitz Denkmal Buelow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]] memorial]]\nThere were signs that all was not well in the [[French army]] at this time. The French empire was seriously short of [[cavalry]] troops and mounts since the 1812 Russian campaign. As a result, there was a lack of screening and [[reconnaissance]].\nThe French command situation was also strained, as Oudinot was angered at being placed under Ney's command. Marshal Ney was determined to advance with all haste to Berlin and this, combined with the poor reconnaissance, allowed the French army to walk right into an assembled Allied defense.\nInitially forced back, the Prussian elements of Bernadotte's army were reinforced by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]] and recovered the lost ground. B\u00fclow would now assume command of the allied side for most of the remainder of the day.\n\nA see-sawing battle now developed, but just as the French appeared on the verge of a victory, Ney, hindered by a lack of support from Oudinot, made a mistake that swung the battle.\nHaving joined in the fighting personally and being unaware of the tactical situation due to a rainstorm on the battlefield, Ney ordered Oudinot to form a reserve. This pull back by Oudinot was perceived as a retreat and the Allies redoubled the attack.\n\nUnder great pressure, the French were forced back. It was at this time that Bernadotte arrived with the remainder of the Army of the North, including his Swedish Corps, on the French left flank and proceeded to attack with seventy fresh battalions<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket. ''Bernadotte: Prince and King.'' Pp. 91-92. John Murray, London. 1925.</ref>. The French, already falling back under heavy pressure, were utterly routed. The French suffered 10,000 casualties, the Allies some 11,000.\n\n[[Image:Dennewitz Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Memorial of the battle, built by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkel]]]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[Bavaria]] withdrew from the war as a result of the failure of the Berlin campaign. Other German states were now wavering in their support of the French Empire. Playing on this wave of German nationalism, Bernadotte issued a proclamation that invited the Saxon Army, whom he was personally popular with as he had commanded them during the [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram Campaign]] of 1809, to defect from the French cause and join his army. A month later the Saxons accepted Bernadotte's invitation and switched sides at a crucial moment during the [[Battle of Leipzig]], dooming the French to defeat. For his superb generalship and courage during the battle, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|Friedrich Wilhelm von B\u00fclow]] was awarded the Grand Cross of the Swedish [[Order of the Sword]] on the battlefield by Bernadotte and was subsequently ennobled as Graf von Dennewitz by the King of Prussia.<ref>Ibid.

Positive-sense viral RNA is similar to [[mRNA]] and thus can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation.

There are three distinct groups of RNA viruses depending on their genome and mode of replication:\n* Double-stranded RNA viruses (Group III) contain from one to a dozen different RNA molecules, each coding for one or more viral proteins.\n* Positive-sense ssRNA viruses (Group IV) have their genome directly utilized as mRNA, with host [[ribosomes]] [[Translation (biology)|translating]] it into a single protein that is modified by host and viral proteins to form the various proteins needed for replication. One of these includes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase), which copies the viral RNA to form a double-stranded replicative form.  In turn this dsRNA directs the formation of new viral RNA.\n* Negative-sense ssRNA viruses (Group V) must have their genome copied by an RNA replicase to form positive-sense RNA. This means that the virus must bring along with it the enzyme RNA replicase. The positive-sense RNA molecule then acts as viral mRNA, which is translated into proteins by the host ribosomes.\n\n[[Retrovirus]]es (Group VI) have a single-stranded RNA genome but, in general, are not considered RNA viruses because they use DNA intermediates to replicate. [[Reverse transcriptase]], a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double-stranded molecule of viral DNA. After this DNA is integrated into the host genome using the viral enzyme [[integrase]], expression of the encoded genes may lead to the formation of new virions.\n\n==Recombination==\n\nNumerous RNA viruses are capable of [[genetic recombination]] when at least two viral [[genome]]s are present in the same host cell.<ref name = Barr2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barr JN, Fearns R | title = How RNA viruses maintain their genome integrity | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 91 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1373\u201387 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20335491 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.020818-0 }}</ref>  RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genome architecture and the course of viral evolution among ''[[Picornavirus|Picornaviridae]]'' ([[positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|(+)ssRNA]]) (e.g. [[poliovirus]]).<ref name=\"pmid31540135\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Muslin C, Mac Kain A, Bessaud M, Blondel B, Delpeyroux F | title = Recombination in Enteroviruses, a Multi-Step Modular Evolutionary Process | journal = Viruses | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | date = September 2019 | pages = 859 | pmid = 31540135 | pmc = 6784155 | doi = 10.3390/v11090859 }}</ref> In the ''[[retrovirus|Retroviridae]]'' ((+)ssRNA)(e.g. [[HIV]]), damage in the RNA genome appears to be avoided during [[reverse transcriptase|reverse transcription]] by strand switching, a form of recombination.<ref name=\"pmid1700865\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu WS, Temin HM | title = Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4985 | pages = 1227\u201333 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 1700865 | doi = 10.1126/science.1700865 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1227H }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid30307534\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rawson JM, Nikolaitchik OA, Keele BF, Pathak VK, Hu WS | title = Recombination is required for efficient HIV-1 replication and the maintenance of viral genome integrity | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 46 | issue = 20 | pages = 10535\u201345 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30307534 | pmc = 6237782 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gky910 }}</ref><ref name = Bernstein2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE | title = Sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 57 | issue =  | pages = 8\u201325 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29111273 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2017.10.024 }}</ref>  Recombination also occurs in the ''[[Reoviridae]]'' (dsRNA)(e.g. reovirus), ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]'' ((-)ssRNA)(e.g. [[influenza virus]])<ref name = Bernstein2018/> and ''[[Coronaviridae]]'' ((+)ssRNA) (e.g. [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]]).<ref name = Su2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Su S, Wong G, Shi W, Liu J, Lai AC, Zhou J, Liu W, Bi Y, Gao GF | display-authors = 6 | title = Epidemiology, Genetic Recombination, and Pathogenesis of Coronaviruses | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 490\u2013502 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27012512 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2016.03.003 }}</ref>  Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage.<ref name = Barr2010/>  Recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages.

This is in part due to the high mutation rates these genomes undergo. Classification is based principally on the type of genome (double-stranded, negative- or positive-single-strand) and gene number and organisation. Currently there are 5 orders and 47 families of RNA viruses recognised. There are also many unassigned species and genera.\n\nRelated to but distinct from the RNA viruses are the [[viroid]]s and the [[Satellite (biology)|RNA satellite viruses]]. These are not currently classified as RNA viruses and are described on their own pages.\n\nA study of several thousand RNA viruses has shown the presence of at least five main taxa: a levivirus and relatives group; a picornavirus supergroup; an alphavirus supergroup plus a flavivirus supergroup; the dsRNA viruses; and the -ve strand viruses.<ref name=Wolf2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf YI, Kazlauskas D, Iranzo J, Luc\u00eda-Sanz A, Kuhn JH, Krupovic M, Dolja VV, Koonin EV | title = Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome | journal = mBio | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30482837 | pmc = 6282212 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.02329-18 }}</ref> The lentivirus group appears to be basal to all the remaining RNA viruses.

There are three distinct groups of RNA viruses depending on their genome and mode of replication:\n* Double-stranded RNA viruses (Group III) contain from one to a dozen different RNA molecules, each coding for one or more viral proteins.\n* Positive-sense ssRNA viruses (Group IV) have their genome directly utilized as mRNA, with host [[ribosomes]] [[Translation (biology)|translating]] it into a single protein that is modified by host and viral proteins to form the various proteins needed for replication. One of these includes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase), which copies the viral RNA to form a double-stranded replicative form.  In turn this dsRNA directs the formation of new viral RNA.\n* Negative-sense ssRNA viruses (Group V) must have their genome copied by an RNA replicase to form positive-sense RNA. This means that the virus must bring along with it the RNA replicase enzyme. The positive-sense RNA molecule then acts as viral mRNA, which is translated into proteins by the host ribosomes.\n\n[[Retrovirus]]es (Group VI) have a single-stranded RNA genome but, in general, are not considered RNA viruses because they use DNA intermediates to replicate. [[Reverse transcriptase]], a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double-stranded molecule of viral DNA. After this DNA is integrated into the host genome using the viral enzyme [[integrase]], expression of the encoded genes may lead to the formation of new virions.\n\n==Recombination==\n\nNumerous RNA viruses are capable of [[genetic recombination]] when at least two viral [[genome]]s are present in the same host cell.<ref name = Barr2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barr JN, Fearns R | title = How RNA viruses maintain their genome integrity | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 91 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1373\u201387 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20335491 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.020818-0 }}</ref>  RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genome architecture and the course of viral evolution among ''[[Picornavirus|Picornaviridae]]'' ([[positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|(+)ssRNA]]) (e.g. [[poliovirus]]).<ref name=\"pmid31540135\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Muslin C, Mac Kain A, Bessaud M, Blondel B, Delpeyroux F | title = Recombination in Enteroviruses, a Multi-Step Modular Evolutionary Process | journal = Viruses | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | date = September 2019 | pages = 859 | pmid = 31540135 | pmc = 6784155 | doi = 10.3390/v11090859 }}</ref> In the ''[[retrovirus|Retroviridae]]'' ((+)ssRNA)(e.g. [[HIV]]), damage in the RNA genome appears to be avoided during [[reverse transcriptase|reverse transcription]] by strand switching, a form of recombination.<ref name=\"pmid1700865\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu WS, Temin HM | title = Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4985 | pages = 1227\u201333 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 1700865 | doi = 10.1126/science.1700865 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1227H }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid30307534\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rawson JM, Nikolaitchik OA, Keele BF, Pathak VK, Hu WS | title = Recombination is required for efficient HIV-1 replication and the maintenance of viral genome integrity | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 46 | issue = 20 | pages = 10535\u201345 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30307534 | pmc = 6237782 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gky910 }}</ref><ref name = Bernstein2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE | title = Sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 57 | issue =  | pages = 8\u201325 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29111273 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2017.10.024 }}</ref>  Recombination also occurs in the ''[[Reoviridae]]'' (dsRNA)(e.g. reovirus), ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]'' ((-)ssRNA)(e.g. [[influenza virus]])<ref name = Bernstein2018/> and ''[[Coronaviridae]]'' ((+)ssRNA) (e.g. [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]]).<ref name = Su2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Su S, Wong G, Shi W, Liu J, Lai AC, Zhou J, Liu W, Bi Y, Gao GF | display-authors = 6 | title = Epidemiology, Genetic Recombination, and Pathogenesis of Coronaviruses | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 490\u2013502 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27012512 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2016.03.003 }}</ref>  Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage.<ref name = Barr2010/>  Recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages.

This is in part due to the high mutation rates these genomes undergo.

It is situated in the [[\u0160ari\u0161]] region on a floodplain terrace of the [[Top\u013ea]] River, in the hills of the [[Beskids|Beskyd Mountains]]. It exhibits numerous cultural monuments in its completely intact medieval town center. The town is one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s and currently maintains a population of about 32,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are two theories about the origin of the name. According to one theory, the name town comes from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word ''\"b\u00e1rd\"'' ({{lang-en|'chopper, hatchet'}}), which indicated an amount of forested territory which could be chopped down by one man in one day. In the Hungarian name (B\u00e1rtfa), the ''\"fa\"'' (English: \"tree\") suffix came later, and it also changed the last letter of \"''b\u00e1rd''\" to \"''b\u00e1rt''\", for easier pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother theory derives the name from a [[Christian name|Christian personal name]] ''Bard\u011bj'', ''Barduj'' (abbreviated forms of [[Bartholomew (name)|Bartholomew]]) with common [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] possessive suffix ''-ov''. This theory is supported by the first recorded form of the name \u2013 ''Bardujef'' (1241). The motivation by the personal name is supported also by the presence of the suffix preserved in later [[Polish language|Polish]] or [[Slovak language|Slovak]] sources.<ref name=\"lexicon\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=\u0160tef\u00e1nik |editor2-first=J\u00e1n |editor2-last=Luka\u010dka |title=Lexik\u00f3n stredovek\u00fdch miest na Slovensku |trans-title=Lexicon of Medieval Towns in Slovakia |pages=79, 97 |publisher=Historick\u00fd \u00fastav SAV |location=Bratislava |year=2010 |isbn=978-80-89396-11-5 |language=Slovak, English |url=http://www.forumhistoriae.sk/e_kniznica/Lexikon-stredovekych-miest.pdf |access-date=2016-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302114716/http://www.forumhistoriae.sk/e_kniznica/Lexikon-stredovekych-miest.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe territory of present-day Bardejov has attracted settlers since the [[Stone Age]]. However, the first written reference to the town dates back to the 1240s, when monks from Bardejov complained to King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] about a violation of the town's borders by [[Pre\u0161ov]]. By that time, the [[Basilica of St. Giles|important church of]] [[Saint Giles|Sv. Aegidius (St. Giles)]] had already been built. Heavily fortified in the 14th century, the town became a center of trade with [[Poland]]. More than 50 [[guild]]s controlled the flourishing economy. Bardejov gained the status of a royal town in 1376, later becoming a [[Free imperial city|free royal town]]. The town\u2019s golden age ended in the 16th century, when several wars, pandemics, and other disasters plagued the country.\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of the 18th century, the situation began to improve. Slovaks and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] came into Bardejov in large numbers. By the end of the century, the population of the town had regained the level of the 16th century.<ref>http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Slovakia/Bardejov-686222/TravelGuide-Bardejov.html</ref> The burghers' houses were rebuilt or modified in keeping with current architectural fashion. A [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] with a [[synagogue]], slaughterhouse, and [[mikveh|ritual baths]] developed in the north-western suburbs. New churches and bridges were built, as well.\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]], Michal Rada\u0161in was called as town pastor.\n\nDespite further fires in the last quarter of the 19th century, the town continued to thrive, thanks to major industrialization projects in the region. In 1893, a railway was opened connecting Presov to Bardejov.<ref>http://www.e-bardejov.sk/historia.php</ref> However, it declined again following the establishment of the first [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]] and became a backward farming region.

It is situated in the [[\u0160ari\u0161]] region on a floodplain terrace of the [[Top\u013ea]] River, in the hills of the [[Beskids|Beskyd Mountains]]. It exhibits numerous cultural monuments in its completely intact medieval town center. The town is one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s and currently maintains a population of about 32,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are two theories about the origin of the name. According to one theory, the name town comes from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word ''\"b\u00e1rd\"'' ({{lang-en|'chopper, hatchet'}}), which indicated an amount of forested territory which could be chopped down by one man in one day. In the Hungarian name (B\u00e1rtfa), the ''\"fa\"'' (English: \"tree\") suffix came later, and it also changed the last letter of \"''b\u00e1rd''\" to \"''b\u00e1rt''\", for easier pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother theory derives the name from a [[Christian name|Christian personal name]] ''Bard\u011bj'', ''Barduj'' (abbreviated forms of [[Bartholomew (name)|Bartholomew]]) with common [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] possessive suffix ''-ov''. This theory is supported by the first recorded form of the name \u2013 ''Bardujef'' (1241). The motivation by the personal name is supported also by the presence of the suffix preserved in later [[Polish language|Polish]] or [[Slovak language|Slovak]] sources.<ref name=\"lexicon\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=\u0160tef\u00e1nik |editor2-first=J\u00e1n |editor2-last=Luka\u010dka |title=Lexik\u00f3n stredovek\u00fdch miest na Slovensku |trans-title=Lexicon of Medieval Towns in Slovakia |pages=79, 97 |publisher=Historick\u00fd \u00fastav SAV |location=Bratislava |year=2010 |isbn=978-80-89396-11-5 |language=Slovak, English |url=http://www.forumhistoriae.sk/e_kniznica/Lexikon-stredovekych-miest.pdf |access-date=2016-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302114716/http://www.forumhistoriae.sk/e_kniznica/Lexikon-stredovekych-miest.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe territory of present-day Bardejov has attracted settlers since the [[Stone Age]]. However, the first written reference to the town dates back to the 1240s, when monks from Bardejov complained to King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] about a violation of the town's borders by [[Pre\u0161ov]]. By that time, the [[Basilica of St. Giles|important church of]] [[Saint Giles|Sv. Aegidius (St. Giles)]] had already been built. Heavily fortified in the 14th century, the town became a center of trade with [[Poland]]. More than 50 [[guild]]s controlled the flourishing economy. Bardejov gained the status of a royal town in 1376, later becoming a [[Free imperial city|free royal town]]. The town\u2019s golden age ended in the 16th century, when several wars, pandemics, and other disasters plagued the country.\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of the 18th century, the situation began to improve. Slovaks and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] came into Bardejov in large numbers. By the end of the century, the population of the town had regained the level of the 16th century.<ref>http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Slovakia/Bardejov-686222/TravelGuide-Bardejov.html</ref> The burghers' houses were rebuilt or modified in keeping with current architectural fashion. A [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] with a [[synagogue]], slaughterhouse, and [[mikveh|ritual baths]] developed in the north-western suburbs. New churches and bridges were built, as well.\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]], Michal Rada\u0161in was called as town pastor.\n\nDespite further fires in the last quarter of the 19th century, the town continued to thrive, thanks to major industrialization projects in the region. In 1893, a railway was opened connecting Presov to Bardejov.<ref>http://www.e-bardejov.sk/historia.php</ref> However, it declined again following the establishment of the first [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]] and became a backward farming region. [[World War II]] saw a worsening in the economic situation, though little damage from bombardment. Bardejov was taken by [[red army|Soviet troops]] of the [[1st Guards Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards Army]] on 20 January 1945.\n\nIn 1950, Bardejov was declared a protected city core and extensive restoration of its cultural heritage began. These efforts culminated in Bardejov receiving the European Gold Medal by the International Board of Trustees in Hamburg in 1986&nbsp;\u2013 the first town in Czechoslovakia to receive the award.<ref>http://www.bardejov.org/bardejov/jewishhistory.html</ref> On November 20, 2000, Bardejov was selected by [[UNESCO]] as one of its [[World Heritage Site]]s, recognized for its Jewish Suburbia and historic town center.

The tribe occupied in the 6th century the [[Eastern Arabia|eastern part of the Arabian peninsula]] before playing an important role with the revelation of Islam. They came into contact with Muhammad in the 8th year of [[Hegira|Hijrah]], but they did not immediately convert to [[Islam]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} There are [[hadith]]s which praise virtually all of the major Arab tribal groups, and to indicate the extent of this praise, a few examples are listed here:\n\n{{quote|I have continued to love Banu Tamim after I heard three things concerning them from Allah's Messenger: \"They will be the sternest of my [[Ummah]] against the [[Dajjal]],\" one of them was a captive owned by [[Aisha]], and he said: \"Free her, for she is a descendent of Ismail,\" and when their zakat came, he said: \"This is the [[zakat]] of a people,\" or \"of my people.\"\"|[[Abu Hurairah]]<ref>(Bukhari, Maghazi, 68.</ref>}}\n\nThe tribe traces its lineage to [[Adnan]] and [[Biblical people in Islam|Biblical figures]] Ishmael and Abraham. It has been said that Banu Tamim is the largest Arab tribe. \"Had it not been for the coming of Islam, the Tam\u012bm tribe would have consumed the Arabs.\"{{cite quote|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn [[Nahj al-Balagha]], Letter 18, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib says:\n\"Remember that Bani Tamim is such a clan that their star has not set as yet, amongst them if one great man dies there is another to take his place. Remember that after embracing Islam and even during pre-Islamic days these people were never regarded as mean, jealous or covetous. On the contrary, they had a very high status. Besides they have claims of kinship and friendship with us. If we behave kindly, patiently and sympathetically towards them Allah will reward us. But if we ill treat them we shall be sinning.\"\n\n==Lineage and Branches==\nBanu Tamim are an [[Adnanite tribe]], which means they claim descent from the [[Ishmael of the Quran]] through Adnan. Banu Tamim trace their lineage as follows:\n* Abraham\n* Ishmael\n* Adnan\n* Ma'ad\n* [[Nizar (Ishmaelites)|Nizar]] \n* [[Mudar ibn Nizar (Ishmaelites)|Mudar ibn Nizar]]\n* [[Ilyas ibn Mudar(Ishmaelites)|Ilyas ibn Mudar]]\n* [[Amr (Ishmaelites)|Amr]] \n* [[Ed(Ishmaelites)|Ed]] \n* [[Mowr(Ishmaelites)|Mowr]] \n* Tamim\n\nFour major branches of this tribe are:\n* [[Amr bin Tamim]]\n* [[Hanthalah]]\n* [[Banu Sa'd|Sa'd]]\n* [[Al rabbab]]\n\nThey were mostly localized in [[Najd]] ([[Saudi Arabia]]) in the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|days before]] [[Muhammad]], but have then expanded to all corners of the Arabian Peninsula in pursuit of the Islamic conquests. Stretching from [[Morocco]] to [[Persia]] and further to [[India]] known as [[Iraqi Biradari]].

They came into contact with Muhammad in the 8th year of [[Hegira|Hijrah]], but they did not immediately convert to [[Islam]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} There are [[hadith]]s which praise virtually all of the major Arab tribal groups, and to indicate the extent of this praise, a few examples are listed here:\n\n{{quote|I have continued to love Banu Tamim after I heard three things concerning them from Allah's Messenger: \"They will be the sternest of my [[Ummah]] against the [[Dajjal]],\" one of them was a captive owned by [[Aisha]], and he said: \"Free her, for she is a descendent of Ismail,\" and when their zakat came, he said: \"This is the [[zakat]] of a people,\" or \"of my people.\"\"|[[Abu Hurairah]]<ref>(Bukhari, Maghazi, 68.</ref>}}\n\nThe tribe traces its lineage to [[Adnan]] and [[Biblical people in Islam|Biblical figures]] Ishmael and Abraham. It has been said that Banu Tamim is the largest Arab tribe. \"Had it not been for the coming of Islam, the Tam\u012bm tribe would have consumed the Arabs.\"{{cite quote|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn [[Nahj al-Balagha]], Letter 18, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib says:\n\"Remember that Bani Tamim is such a clan that their star has not set as yet, amongst them if one great man dies there is another to take his place. Remember that after embracing Islam and even during pre-Islamic days these people were never regarded as mean, jealous or covetous. On the contrary, they had a very high status. Besides they have claims of kinship and friendship with us. If we behave kindly, patiently and sympathetically towards them Allah will reward us. But if we ill treat them we shall be sinning.\"\n\n==Lineage and Branches==\nBanu Tamim are an [[Adnanite tribe]], which means they claim descent from the [[Ishmael of the Quran]] through Adnan. Banu Tamim trace their lineage as follows:\n* Abraham\n* Ishmael\n* Adnan\n* Ma'ad\n* [[Nizar (Ishmaelites)|Nizar]] \n* [[Mudar ibn Nizar (Ishmaelites)|Mudar ibn Nizar]]\n* [[Ilyas ibn Mudar(Ishmaelites)|Ilyas ibn Mudar]]\n* [[Amr (Ishmaelites)|Amr]] \n* [[Ed(Ishmaelites)|Ed]] \n* [[Mowr(Ishmaelites)|Mowr]] \n* Tamim\n\nFour major branches of this tribe are:\n* [[Amr bin Tamim]]\n* [[Hanthalah]]\n* [[Banu Sa'd|Sa'd]]\n* [[Al rabbab]]\n\nThey were mostly localized in [[Najd]] ([[Saudi Arabia]]) in the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|days before]] [[Muhammad]], but have then expanded to all corners of the Arabian Peninsula in pursuit of the Islamic conquests. Stretching from [[Morocco]] to [[Persia]] and further to [[India]] known as [[Iraqi Biradari]]. The Banu Tamim often hold genealogy in high regard, carefully recording birth and family data (especially in the Arabian Peninsula).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Dynasties==\n* The [[Aghlabid]] dynasty\n* The [[List of emirs of Qatar|Al Thani]], ruling family of [[Qatar]] (See [[House of Thani]]).\n* The [[Al ash-Sheikh]] family of the [[Grand Mufti]]s of the [[Emirate of Diriyah]], then the [[Emirate of Nejd|Emirate of Najd]] and now modern day Saudi Arabia (religious dynasty).\n* [[Al Khater]] \u2013 a family of the middle east based primarily in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and [[Bahrain]]\n* [[Majali|Al Majali]] \u2013 rulers of tribes of [[Al-Karak]] in [[Jordan]] in the 19th century.\n*Al Maayta- family of [[Al-Karak]] \n*Al Bayayda-family of [[Al-Karak]]\n\n==Notable people==\nAmong the tribe's members are:\n* Khabbab ibn al-Aratt \u2013 a [[Sahaba|companion]] of [[Muhammad]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/history/biographies/sahaabah/bio.KHABBAB_IBN_AL_ARATT.html |title=Khabbab ibn al-Aratt |access-date=2011-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523043612/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/history/biographies/sahaabah/bio.KHABBAB_IBN_AL_ARATT.html |archive-date=2006-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Ahnaf ibn Qais]], companion of [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]\n* [[Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Sa'id al-Tamimi]] \u2013 physician in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the 10th century [[Common Era|CE]]\n* [[Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi]] \u2013 Muslim saint Of the Junaidia order\n* [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh|Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh al-Tamimi]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m9MyTKFbJkwC&q=ibn+Ibadh+banu+tamim&dq=ibn+Ibadh+banu+tamim|title=Milla Wa-milla|date=1961|publisher=Department of Middle Eastern Studies, University of Melbourne.|language=en}} p.46</ref> \u2013 Founder of the [[Ibadi]] sect\n* [[Al-Farazdaq]] - Classical poet\n* [[Al-Hurr ibn Yazid al Tamimi]] - A general of the [[Umayyads]] who defected to [[Husayn ibn Ali]]\n* [[Al-Qa'qa'a ibn Amr at-Tamimi]] \u2013 A general who commanded an army from his tribe and helped conquer Persia under Caliph Umar\n* [[Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi]] \u2013 Shafi'i scholar and mathematician from [[Baghdad]]\n* [[Muhammed ibn Umail al-Tamimi]] \u2013 tenth century alchemist from [[Al-Andalus]]\n* [[Ibn Ishaq al-Tunisi|Ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi al-Tunisi]] \u2013 13th century [[Tunisia]]n astronomer and the author of an important ''zij''\n* [[Bassem al-Tamimi]] \u2013 an activist leader and member of the Palestinian Resistance<ref>[http://www.marefa.org/index.php/\u0628\u0646\u064a_\u0645\u0631\u060c_\u0623\u0633\u064a\u0648\u0637 Marefa]</ref>\n* [[Ahed Tamimi]] \u2013 Daughter of Bassem Al-Tamimi, also a Palestinian activist\n* [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab]] \u2013 Founder of the [[Aghlabids]]' Dynasty, the emirs of [[Ifriqiya]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] from 800-909.\n* [[Jarir (poet)|Jar\u012br]] \u2013 classical Arab poet<ref>[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/AUD_BAI/AUTHORITIBS.html Jrank]</ref>\n* [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani]] \u2013 founder of the State of Qatar\n* [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ReoiwJiOqQAC&pg=PA15&dq=Wahhabi+banu+tamim#v=onepage&q=Wahhabi%20banu%20tamim&f=false|title=A History of Saudi Arabia|last=al-Rasheed|first=Madawi|authorlink=Madawi al-Rasheed|date=April 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521761284|location=|pages=15}}</ref>.\n* [[Muhammad Ibn Saalih Ibn 'Uthaymeen|Muhammad Ibn al 'Uthaym\u012bn]] (d. 2001 C.E.) \u2013 Saudi [[Salafi]] preacher\n* [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi]] \u2013 ruler of eastern parts of archaic Arabian peninsula who converted to Islam\n* [[Sheikh Edebali]] - Sufi Master who served in the foundation of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092249/http://www.royalblood.co.uk/D285/I285311.html Royal Ancestry File]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=XjwBAAAAQAAJ&dq=tamim&pg=PR193#v=onepage&q=tamim&f=true The life of Mahomet] by [[William Muir]]\n\n{{Arab tribes in Iraq}}\n{{Arab tribes in Qatar}}\n{{Arab tribes in Saudi Arabia}}\n{{Arab tribes in the United Arab Emirates}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tamim}}\n[[Category:Mudar]]\n[[Category:Arab groups]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Algeria]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Arabia]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Saudi Arabia]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Libya]]\n[[Category:Tribes of the United Arab Emirates]]\n[[Category:Yemeni tribes]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Iraq]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Syria]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Jordan]]\n[[Category:Banu Tamim| ]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Tamim"}

In the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] of Bangladesh, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But the handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and civil servants carry out this policy.\n\n==History==\nThe civil bureaucracy is a [[British Raj|colonial legacy]] in this part of the world. The British used to rule the native population through [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) and most of the officers in ICS were British themselves. It was in the early 20th century that the Indians also started competing against the British and many Indians eventually made it to the ICS. With the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the term 'Central Superior Services' was used in Pakistan and the concept of All-Pakistan Services continued. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangladesh Civil Service is formed to gear up the government system of the newly born country by an act from the then President [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].\n\n==Formation of the Commission==\n{{Main|Bangladesh Public Service Commission}}Bangladesh Public Service Commission a constitutional body established primarily  recruit persons for various services and posts in the government. It is also involved in decision processes relating to other service matters such as promotion, posting, transfer, discipline, and appeal of the government servants. The main purpose of constituting such a body, designated in most countries of British heritage as 'civil' or 'public' service commission, is to ensure that all decisions relating to recruitment and other service matters are made consistent with the principles of merit and equity. In Bangladesh, this body is presently designated as the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC).\nA commission called Public Service Commission was first established in India in 1926, when it was entrusted with functions almost similar to those of its British counterpart in London, particularly in matters of recruitment of public servants of the central government of British India. Similar provincial level commissions were subsequently established, including the Bengal Public Service Commission in 1937, following the formation of responsible governments in the provinces in pursuance of provisions made in the Government of India Act, 1919, and thereafter in the Government of India Act, 1935. After the partition of India in 1947, replicas of the Public Service Commission in British India were created in Pakistan, both at central and provincial levels. Hence a body designated as Public Service Commission, Eastern Pakistan (renamed later East Pakistan Public Service Commission) came into being in East Bengal (later named East Pakistan) in August 1947.\nAfter the emergence of Bangladesh two separate commissions, namely the Public Service Commission (First), and the Public Service Commission (Second), were initially established in May 1972 under provisions made in President's Order No. 34 of 1972. But to give effect to the provisions on public service commissions in the constitution adopted in November 1972, a fresh Presidential Order (President's Order No. 25 of 1973) was promulgated in March 1973 which in effect formally regularized the establishment of the two commissions in existence since May 1972. However, in November 1977 the government promulgated another ordinance to establish a single commission in place of the existing two commissions, which, in effect, came into being on 22 December 1977 and was designated as Bangladesh Public Service Commission.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Syed Giasuddin |year=2012 |chapter=Bangladesh Public Service Commission |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Public_Service_Commission |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n\n==Constitutional structure==\nThe [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] provides the fundamental law to construct The Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC), a quasi judicial body that works under the provisions of the Article 137 \u2013 141 of the Constitution of Bangladesh and certain other rules and regulations made by the government from time to time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Public Service Commission|title=Civil Service of Bangladesh|url=http://www.bpsc.gov.bd/platform/node/10.bpsc2012.pml|work=Bangladesh Public Service Commission|publisher=BPSC|accessdate=23 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215841/http://www.bpsc.gov.bd/platform/node/10.bpsc2012.pml|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nBangladeshi Nationals are recruited through the provisions of the constitution from article 133 to 136<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part9.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193843/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part9.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and article 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221035/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part3.htm |archivedate=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Head of the Civil Service===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Cabinet Secretary]] as well as a number of other pages -->\nThe highest ranking civil servant is the Chief of the Cabinet Secretariat of the People's Republic of Bangladesh who is also the [[Cabinet Secretary (Bangladesh)|Cabinet Secretary]].

In the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] of Bangladesh, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But the handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and civil servants carry out this policy.\n\n==History==\nThe civil bureaucracy is a [[British Raj|colonial legacy]] in this part of the world. The British used to rule the native population through [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) and most of the officers in ICS were British themselves. It was in the early 20th century that the Indians also started competing against the British and many Indians eventually made it to the ICS. With the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the term 'Central Superior Services' was used in Pakistan and the concept of All-Pakistan Services continued. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangladesh Civil Service is formed to gear up the government system of the newly born country by an act from the then President [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].\n\n==Formation of the Commission==\n{{Main|Bangladesh Public Service Commission}}Bangladesh Public Service Commission a constitutional body established primarily  recruit persons for various services and posts in the government. It is also involved in decision processes relating to other service matters such as promotion, posting, transfer, discipline, and appeal of the government servants. The main purpose of constituting such a body, designated in most countries of British heritage as 'civil' or 'public' service commission, is to ensure that all decisions relating to recruitment and other service matters are made consistent with the principles of merit and equity. In Bangladesh, this body is presently designated as the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC).\nA commission called Public Service Commission was first established in India in 1926, when it was entrusted with functions almost similar to those of its British counterpart in London, particularly in matters of recruitment of public servants of the central government of British India. Similar provincial level commissions were subsequently established, including the Bengal Public Service Commission in 1937, following the formation of responsible governments in the provinces in pursuance of provisions made in the Government of India Act, 1919, and thereafter in the Government of India Act, 1935. After the partition of India in 1947, replicas of the Public Service Commission in British India were created in Pakistan, both at central and provincial levels. Hence a body designated as Public Service Commission, Eastern Pakistan (renamed later East Pakistan Public Service Commission) came into being in East Bengal (later named East Pakistan) in August 1947.\nAfter the emergence of Bangladesh two separate commissions, namely the Public Service Commission (First), and the Public Service Commission (Second), were initially established in May 1972 under provisions made in President's Order No. 34 of 1972. But to give effect to the provisions on public service commissions in the constitution adopted in November 1972, a fresh Presidential Order (President's Order No. 25 of 1973) was promulgated in March 1973 which in effect formally regularized the establishment of the two commissions in existence since May 1972. However, in November 1977 the government promulgated another ordinance to establish a single commission in place of the existing two commissions, which, in effect, came into being on 22 December 1977 and was designated as Bangladesh Public Service Commission.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Syed Giasuddin |year=2012 |chapter=Bangladesh Public Service Commission |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Public_Service_Commission |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n\n==Constitutional structure==\nThe [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] provides the fundamental law to construct The Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC), a quasi judicial body that works under the provisions of the Article 137 \u2013 141 of the Constitution of Bangladesh and certain other rules and regulations made by the government from time to time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Public Service Commission|title=Civil Service of Bangladesh|url=http://www.bpsc.gov.bd/platform/node/10.bpsc2012.pml|work=Bangladesh Public Service Commission|publisher=BPSC|accessdate=23 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215841/http://www.bpsc.gov.bd/platform/node/10.bpsc2012.pml|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nBangladeshi Nationals are recruited through the provisions of the constitution from article 133 to 136<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part9.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193843/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part9.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and article 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221035/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part3.htm |archivedate=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Head of the Civil Service===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Cabinet Secretary]] as well as a number of other pages -->\nThe highest ranking civil servant is the Chief of the Cabinet Secretariat of the People's Republic of Bangladesh who is also the [[Cabinet Secretary (Bangladesh)|Cabinet Secretary]].
