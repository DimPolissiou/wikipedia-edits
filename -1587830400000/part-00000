Autonomous Region''' ('''NHAR'''), is a landlocked [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous region]] in [[Northwest China|the northwest]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Formerly a [[Province (China)|province]], Ningxia was incorporated into [[Gansu]] in 1954 but was separated from Gansu in 1958 and was reconstituted as an autonomous region for the [[Hui people]], one of the 56 officially recognised [[List of ethnic groups in China|nationalities of China]]. Twenty percent of China's Hui population lives in Ningxia.<ref>{{cite news|title=By choosing assimilation, China's Hui have become one of the world's most successful Muslim minorities|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21708274-choosing-assimilation-chinas-hui-have-become-one-worlds-most-successful-muslim|accessdate=8 October 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=8 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nNingxia is bounded by [[Shaanxi]] to the east, Gansu to the south and west and [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region to the north and has an area of around {{convert|66400|km2}}.<ref name=area/> This sparsely settled, mostly desert region lies partially on the [[Loess Plateau]] and in the vast plain of the [[Yellow River]] and features the [[Great Wall of China]] along its northeastern boundary. Over the years an expensive and extensive system of [[canal]]s has been built. Extensive [[land reclamation]] and [[irrigation]] projects have made increased cultivation possible.\n\nWinemaking continues to boost the economy of what is still one of the country's poorest areas. Before the arrival of [[viticulture]], Ningxia's 6.8 million people, 36 per cent of whom are Muslims from the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic group, relied largely on [[Grazing|animal grazing]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and the cultivation of [[Goji|wolfberries]] used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. The province housed almost 40,000 hectares of wine grapes and produced 120 million wine bottles in 2017 \u2013 a quarter of the entire nation's production.<ref>https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3009784/can-china-become-wine-worlds-next-california</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:108 Dagobas.JPG|thumb|left|The [[One Hundred and Eight Stupas|108 stupas]] near [[Qingtongxia]].]]\nAs a frontier zone between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers, Ningxia was a frequent seat of war and incursions by non-Chinese tribes. To pacify the region, the imperial government established military colonies to reclaim land. In addition, horse pasturages were founded under the Imperial Stud to safeguard the supply of army horses, as early as the Western [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE \u2013 9 CE).<ref name=journal /> Ningxia and its surrounding areas were incorporated into the [[Qin dynasty]] as early as the 3rd century BC. Throughout the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Tang dynasty]] there were several large cities established in the region. The [[Liang Province rebellion]] at the [[end of the Han Dynasty]] affected Ningxia.\n\nBy the 11th century the [[Tangut people]] had established the [[Western Xia dynasty]] on the outskirts of the then-[[Song dynasty]]. Jews also lived in Ningxia, as evidenced by the fact that in 1489, after a major flood destroyed [[Torah scroll]]s in [[Kaifeng]], a replacement was sent to the [[Kaifeng Jews]] by the [[Ningbo]] and Ningxia [[Jews in China|Jewish communities]].<ref>Xu Xin, ''The Jews of Kaifeng'', Ktav Publishing House, c. 2003.</ref>\n\nIt then came under [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] domination after [[Genghis Khan]] conquered [[Yinchuan]] in the early 13th century. Muslims from Central Asia also began moving into Ningxia from the west. The Muslim [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]] of the 19th century affected Ningxia.\n\nIn 1914, Ningxia was merged with the [[Provinces of China|province]] of [[Gansu]]. However, in 1928 it was detached from Gansu and became a separate province. Between 1914 and 1928, the [[Ma clique]] ruled the provinces of [[Qinghai]], Ningxia and Gansu; General [[Ma Hongkui]] was the military governor of Ningxia and had absolute authority in the province. The [[Muslim conflict in Gansu (1927\u201330)|Muslim conflict in Gansu]], which lasted from 1927 to 1930, spilled over into Ningxia. In 1934, warlord and [[National Revolutionary Army]] general [[Sun Dianying]] [[War in Ningxia (1934)|attempted to conquer]] the province, but was defeated by an alliance led by the [[Ma clique]].{{sfnp|Lin|2011|pp=37\u201339}}\n\nFrom 1950 to 1958, a [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950\u20131958)|Kuomintang Islamic insurgency]] resulted in fighting throughout Northwest China, including Ningxia. In 1954, the [[Chinese government]] merged Ningxia with Gansu, but in 1958 Ningxia formally became an [[autonomous region of China]]. In 1969, Ningxia received a part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, but this area was returned in 1979.\n\nA number of Chinese artifacts dating from the [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]], some of which had been owned by [[Emperor Zhenzong]], were excavated and then came into the hands of Ma Hongkui, who refused to publicize the findings. Among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the Tang dynasty, gold nails, and bands made out of metal. It was not until after Ma died that his wife went to Taiwan in 1971 from America to bring the artifacts to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who turned them over to the [[Taipei]] [[National Palace Museum]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UzrAAAAMAAJ&q=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace&dq=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace|title=China Archaeology and Art Digest, Volume 3, Issue 4|author=|year=2000|publisher=Art Text (HK) Ltd.|location=|page=354|isbn=|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Helanshan.jpg|thumb|left|From a cable car running to the top of [[Helan Mountains]].]]\nPresent-day Ningxia is one of the nation's smallest provincial-level units and borders the provinces of [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]] and the [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]].

Ningxia's deserts include the [[Tengger desert]] in [[Shapotou]].\n\nThe northern section, through which the Yellow River flows, supports the best agricultural land. A railroad, linking [[Lanzhou]] with [[Baotou]], crosses the region. A highway has been built across the Yellow River at Yinchuan.\n\nOn 16 December 1920, the [[1920 Haiyuan earthquake|Haiyuan earthquake]], 8.6 magnitude, at {{coord|36.6|105.32}}, initiated a series of landslides that killed an estimated 200,000 people.

Ningxia boasts verified coal reserves of over 30 billion tons, with an estimated reserve of more than 202 billion tons, ranking sixth nationwide. Coal deposits are spread over one-third of the total surface of Ningxia, and mined in four major fields in the Helan and Xiangshan mountains, Ningdong and Yuanzhou (or Guyuan). The region's reserves of oil and natural gas can be found in Yanchi and Lingwu County, and are ideal for large-scale development of oil, natural gas and chemical industries. Ningxia leads China in gypsum deposits, with a proven reserve of more than 4.5 billion tons, of which the rarely found, top-grade gypsum accounts for half of the total deposits. The Hejiakouzi deposit in Tongxin County features a reserve of 20 million tons of gypsum with a total thickness of 100 meters. There is a considerable deposit of quartz sandstone, of which 17 million tons have been ascertained. In addition, there are phosphorus, flint, copper, iron, barite, other minerals and Helan stone \u2013 a special clay stone.<ref>Hsieh, C.M. 2016. Ningxia.

Autonomous Region''' ('''NHAR'''), is a landlocked [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous region]] in [[Northwest China|Northwestern China]]. Formerly a [[Province (China)|province]], Ningxia was incorporated into [[Gansu]] in 1954 but was separated from Gansu in 1958 and was reconstituted as an autonomous region for the [[Hui people]], one of the 56 officially recognised [[List of ethnic groups in China|nationalities of China]]. Twenty percent of China's Hui population lives in Ningxia.<ref>{{cite news|title=By choosing assimilation, China's Hui have become one of the world's most successful Muslim minorities|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21708274-choosing-assimilation-chinas-hui-have-become-one-worlds-most-successful-muslim|accessdate=8 October 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=8 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nNingxia is bounded by [[Shaanxi]] to the east, Gansu to the south and west and [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region to the north and has an area of around {{convert|66400|km2}}.<ref name=area/> This sparsely settled, mostly desert region lies partially on the [[Loess Plateau]] and in the vast plain of the [[Yellow River]] and features the [[Great Wall of China]] along its northeastern boundary. Over the years an expensive and extensive system of [[canal]]s has been built. Extensive [[land reclamation]] and [[irrigation]] projects have made increased cultivation possible.\n\nWinemaking continues to boost the economy of what is still one of the country's poorest areas. Before the arrival of [[viticulture]], Ningxia's 6.8 million people, 36 per cent of whom are Muslims from the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic group, relied largely on [[Grazing|animal grazing]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and the cultivation of [[Goji|wolfberries]] used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. The province housed almost 40,000 hectares of wine grapes and produced 120 million wine bottles in 2017 \u2013 a quarter of the entire nation's production.<ref>https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3009784/can-china-become-wine-worlds-next-california</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:108 Dagobas.JPG|thumb|left|The [[One Hundred and Eight Stupas|108 stupas]] near [[Qingtongxia]].]]\nAs a frontier zone between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers, Ningxia was a frequent seat of war and incursions by non-Chinese tribes. To pacify the region, the imperial government established military colonies to reclaim land. In addition, horse pasturages were founded under the Imperial Stud to safeguard the supply of army horses, as early as the Western [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE \u2013 9 CE).<ref name=journal /> Ningxia and its surrounding areas were incorporated into the [[Qin dynasty]] as early as the 3rd century BC. Throughout the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Tang dynasty]] there were several large cities established in the region. The [[Liang Province rebellion]] at the [[end of the Han Dynasty]] affected Ningxia.\n\nBy the 11th century the [[Tangut people]] had established the [[Western Xia dynasty]] on the outskirts of the then-[[Song dynasty]]. Jews also lived in Ningxia, as evidenced by the fact that in 1489, after a major flood destroyed [[Torah scroll]]s in [[Kaifeng]], a replacement was sent to the [[Kaifeng Jews]] by the [[Ningbo]] and Ningxia [[Jews in China|Jewish communities]].<ref>Xu Xin, ''The Jews of Kaifeng'', Ktav Publishing House, c. 2003.</ref>\n\nIt then came under [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] domination after [[Genghis Khan]] conquered [[Yinchuan]] in the early 13th century. Muslims from Central Asia also began moving into Ningxia from the west. The Muslim [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]] of the 19th century affected Ningxia.\n\nIn 1914, Ningxia was merged with the [[Provinces of China|province]] of [[Gansu]]. However, in 1928 it was detached from Gansu and became a separate province. Between 1914 and 1928, the [[Ma clique]] ruled the provinces of [[Qinghai]], Ningxia and Gansu; General [[Ma Hongkui]] was the military governor of Ningxia and had absolute authority in the province. The [[Muslim conflict in Gansu (1927\u201330)|Muslim conflict in Gansu]], which lasted from 1927 to 1930, spilled over into Ningxia. In 1934, warlord and [[National Revolutionary Army]] general [[Sun Dianying]] [[War in Ningxia (1934)|attempted to conquer]] the province, but was defeated by an alliance led by the [[Ma clique]].{{sfnp|Lin|2011|pp=37\u201339}}\n\nFrom 1950 to 1958, a [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950\u20131958)|Kuomintang Islamic insurgency]] resulted in fighting throughout Northwest China, including Ningxia. In 1954, the [[Chinese government]] merged Ningxia with Gansu, but in 1958 Ningxia formally became an [[autonomous region of China]]. In 1969, Ningxia received a part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, but this area was returned in 1979.\n\nA number of Chinese artifacts dating from the [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]], some of which had been owned by [[Emperor Zhenzong]], were excavated and then came into the hands of Ma Hongkui, who refused to publicize the findings. Among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the Tang dynasty, gold nails, and bands made out of metal. It was not until after Ma died that his wife went to Taiwan in 1971 from America to bring the artifacts to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who turned them over to the [[Taipei]] [[National Palace Museum]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UzrAAAAMAAJ&q=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace&dq=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace|title=China Archaeology and Art Digest, Volume 3, Issue 4|author=|year=2000|publisher=Art Text (HK) Ltd.|location=|page=354|isbn=|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Helanshan.jpg|thumb|left|From a cable car running to the top of [[Helan Mountains]].]]\nPresent-day Ningxia is one of the nation's smallest provincial-level units and borders the provinces of [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]] and the [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]].

Coal deposits are spread over one-third of the total surface of Ningxia, and mined in four major fields in the Helan and Xiangshan mountains, Ningdong and Yuanzhou (or Guyuan). The region's reserves of oil and natural gas can be found in Yanchi and Lingwu County, and are ideal for large-scale development of oil, natural gas and chemical industries. Ningxia leads China in gypsum deposits, with a proven reserve of more than 4.5 billion tons, of which the rarely found, top-grade gypsum accounts for half of the total deposits. The Hejiakouzi deposit in Tongxin County features a reserve of 20 million tons of gypsum with a total thickness of 100 meters. There is a considerable deposit of quartz sandstone, of which 17 million tons have been ascertained. In addition, there are phosphorus, flint, copper, iron, barite, other minerals and Helan stone \u2013 a special clay stone.<ref>Hsieh, C.M. 2016. Ningxia.

Its nominal GDP in 2011 was just 200.0 billion yuan (US$32.7 billion) and a per capita GDP of 21,470 yuan (US$3,143). It contributes 0.44% of the [[Economy of China|national economy]].\n\nUnlike several other underdeveloped provinces, labor costs in Ningxia are among the highest in China (ranking in the top third percentile), making it unattractive as a manufacturing center. Furthermore, Ningxia has yet to become a hub for consumption due to its low population.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Agriculture===\nSimilar to other areas, Ningxia has seen a gradual decline of its peasant population due to rural\u2013urban migration. In spite of this, the great majority (62.8 percent) was still agricultural at the time of the survey.<ref>Ningxia Bureau of Statistics 2013, 4.2</ref> Animal husbandry is important for the regional economy. In the main pastoral county, Yanchi, it is even the leading industry when specified for the primary sector. The dominant grazing animals are sheep and goat.<ref>Ningxia Bureau of Statistics 2013, 11.20</ref> In the (semi-)pastoral regions, herders engage in a mixed sedentary farming operation of dryland agriculture and extensive animal husbandry, while full nomadic pastoralism is no longer practiced.<ref name=\"Peter 2016\"/>\n\nNingxia is the principal region of China where [[Wolfberry|wolfberries]] are grown. Other specialties of Ningxia are [[licorice]], products made from Helan stone, [[fiddlehead]] and products made from [[sheepskin]].\n\n[[Ningxia wines]] are a promising area of development. The Chinese authorities have given approval to the development of the eastern base of the [[Helan Mountains]] as an area suitable for wine production. Several large Chinese wine companies including Changyu and Dynasty Wine have begun development in the western region of the province. Together they now own 20,000 acres of land for wine plantations and Dynasty has ploughed 100 million yuan into Ningxia. In addition, the major oil company [[China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation]] has founded a grape plantation near the Helan Mountains. The household appliance company [[Midea (company)|Midea]] has also begun participating in Ningxia's wine industry.<ref>[http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1102&MainCatID=11&id=20111215000020 \"Grape expansion: Chinese wine companies move west\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731231303/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1102&MainCatID=11&id=20111215000020 |date=31 July 2015 }}, ''Want China Times'', 15 December 2011.

The industrial park has industrial chains from Muslim food and commodities to trade and logistics, new materials and bio-pharmaceuticals that has 80 billion yuan in fixed assets.

RR6 represents the maximum response rate.\n\nThe six AAPOR definitions vary with respect to whether or not the surveys are partially or entirely completed and how researchers deal with unknown nonrespondents. Definition #1, for example, does NOT include partially completed surveys in the numerator, while definition #2 does. Definitions 3\u20136 deal with the unknown eligibility of potential respondents who could not be contacted. For example, there is no answer at the doors of 10 houses you attempted to survey. Maybe 5 of those you already know house people who qualify for your survey based on neighbors telling you whom lived there, but the other 5 are completely unknown. Maybe the dwellers fit your target population, maybe they don't. This may or may not be considered in your response rate, depending on which definition you use.\n\nExample: if 1,000 surveys were sent by mail, and 257 were successfully completed (entirely) and returned, then the response rate would be 25.7%.\n\n==Importance==\nA survey\u2019s response rate is the result of dividing the number of people who were interviewed by the total number of people in the sample who were eligible to participate and should have been interviewed.<ref>\"Response Rates \u2013 An Overview.\" American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 29 Sept 2008. http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/Poll-Survey-FAQ/Response-Rates-An-Overview.aspx</ref> A low response rate can give rise to [[biased sample|sampling bias]] if the nonresponse is unequal among the participants regarding exposure and/or outcome.

Many observers presumed that higher response rates assure more accurate survey results (Aday 1996; Babbie 1990; Backstrom and Hursh 1963; Rea and Parker 1997). But because measuring the relation between nonresponse and the accuracy of a survey statistic is complex and expensive, few rigorously designed studies provided empirical evidence to document the consequences of lower response rates until recently.\n\nSuch studies have finally been conducted in recent years, and several conclude that the expense of increasing the response rate frequently is not justified given the difference in survey accuracy.\n\nOne early example of a finding was reported by Visser, Krosnick, Marquette and Curtin (1996) who showed that surveys with lower response rates (near 20%) yielded more accurate measurements than did surveys with higher response rates (near 60 or 70%).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Visser | first1 = Penny S. | last2 = Krosnick | first2 = Jon A. | last3 = Marquette | first3 = Jesse | last4 = Curtin | first4 = Michael | year = 1996 | title = Mail Surveys for Election Forecasting?
