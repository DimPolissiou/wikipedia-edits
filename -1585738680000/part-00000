He created strong ties with the [[Soviet Air Force]]. When the [[USSR]] went bankrupt in the 1990s, he purchased cargo planes at very cheap prices. With these planes he started the family's illegal enterprise.\n===Irena Aramov===\nIrena is Lev's wife. When Lev died, she became head of the clan. After an attempt on her life by Leonid, she makes a deal with the TFU to hand over the clan in order to get expensive cancer treatment in the United States. She dies of cancer in the events following ''[[Black Friday (Robert Muchamore novel)|Black Friday]]''.\n===Josef Aramov===\nJosef is the eldest son of Irena and Lev. After the TFU takes over the Aramov Clan, he also makes a deal to guarantee immunity from prosecution. Within this deal he is made a figurehead for the TFU's campaign to wind down operations and destroy all their smuggling equipment. Amy Collins, former CHERUB agent and active TFU agent, plays the role of his girlfriend in the TFU's crushing of the Aramov Clan.\n===Leonid Aramov===\nLeonid is the second son of Irena and Lev. He is second in command of the Aramov Clan, after his mother, as his elder brother, Josef, was thought to be weak. His character is described as short tempered and very aggressive. After trying to murder his mother he was kicked out of the clan along with his sons, Boris and Alex.\n===Galenka Aramov===\nGalenka is the daughter of Irena and Lev. She split from the clan and changed her name to 'Gillian Kitsell' to study [[mathematics]] in the USA. After gaining a degree, she founded a computer-based company in [[Silicon Valley]]. As she was homosexual, she gave birth to her son Ethan with a sperm donor. CHERUB, along with TFU, target her and her son to try to break apart the Aramov Clan's Operations. Galenka is killed by a squad of professionals sent by Leonid.\n===Tamara Aramov===\nEx-wife of Leonid and mother of Andre. She was threatened by Leonid after the divorce and stayed to look after Andre once Leonid had been kicked out of the Kremlin. She offered to help the TFU track down Leonid. She and her son Andre were taken by Leonid to Mexico. She eventually shot him dead in the bathroom of their villa before escaping with her son and James Adams. She and her son went to Russia, where she now works in a jewellery store owned by her uncle.\n===Ethan Aramov===\nEthan is Galenka's only son. He is befriended by CHERUB agent Ryan Sharma in the TFU operation. When his mother is assassinated, the assassins mistakenly kill Ethan's best friend, thinking he is Ethan. He escapes, and after his mother is killed, he goes into protective custody with Ted Brasker, a TFU agent. He then helps the operation in questioning Paolo Lombardi and finding that his mother worked with Jane Oxford.\n===Andre Aramov===\nAndre is the son of Tamara and Leonid. He lives in the Kremlin and attends the same school as Natalka and Ryan. He trains for the mission to find and take down Leonid with [[James Adams (character)|James Adams]] on the CHERUB campus. After seeing his mother kill Leonid, they emigrate to Russia, where he attends a fee-paying school.\n===Boris Aramov===\nBoris is the oldest son of Leonid and his unnamed first wife. He is kicked out of the Kremlin with his brother, Alex, and his father after the attempted murder of his grandmother by Leonid, before escaping to Mexico. After the death of his father, he and his brother move to [[Trinidad]], where Boris is arrested for savagely beating a French tourist.\n===Alex Aramov===\nAlex is the second son of Leonid and his unnamed first wife. He was kicked out of the Kremlin with his brother, Boris and his father after the attempted murder of his grandmother by Leonid, before escaping to Mexico. After the death of his father, he and his brother move to [[Trinidad]], where Alex is arrested when the police found steroids and other illegal drugs stashed in their apartment.

Of those that received use of force from a police officer or were threatened with use of force almost 75% reported that they believed it was excessive and unwarranted. This statistic was consistent across the Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic races.<ref>U.S. Department of Justice. (2011). ''Contacts Between Police and the Public, 2008. ''(NCJ 234599). Washington, DC.</ref>\n\nA report by the ''Washington Post'' found that 385 Americans were [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|fatally shot by law enforcement officers]] in the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two fatal shootings a day, which was more than twice the rate reported in official statistics. 221 of those killed were armed with guns, and 68 were armed with knives or other blades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fatal-police-shootings-in-2015-approaching-400-nationwide/2015/05/30/d322256a-058e-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html?hpid=z1| author=Kimberly Kindy| title=Fatal police shootings in 2015 approaching 400 nationwide| work=The Washington Post| date=May 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Officer attributes==\n===Education===\n\nStudies have shown that law enforcement personnel with some college education (typically two-year degrees) use force much less often than those with little to no higher education.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Galvan|first1=Astrid|title=Study: Educated Cops Less Likely To Use Force|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/3023320metro11-30-10.htm|accessdate=October 10, 2014|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=November 30, 2010}}</ref> In events that the educated officers do use force, it is usually what is considered \"reasonable\" force.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Worden|first1=Robert E.|title=And Justice for All: Understanding and Controlling Police Abuse of Force|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=23\u201351}}</ref> Despite these findings, very little - only 1% - of police forces within the United States have education requirements for those looking to join their forces.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rydberg|first1=Jason|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=The Effect of Higher Education on Police Behavior|journal=Police Quarterly|year=2010|volume=13|issue=1|pages=92\u2013120|doi=10.1177/1098611109357325}}</ref> Some argue that police work deeply requires experience that can only be gained from actually working in the field.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Paoline III|first1=Eugene A.|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|doi=10.1177/0093854806290239}}</ref>\n\n===Experience===\nIt is argued that the skills for performing law enforcement tasks well cannot be produced from a classroom setting.

The type of policies established and whether or not they are enforced can affect an officer's likeliness to use force. If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the [[Rodney King]] case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force. Training offered by the department can be a contributing factor, as well, though it has only been a recent addition to include information on when to use force, rather than how to use force.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=Roger G.|last2=Alpert|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=513\u2013527|edition=6}}</ref>\n\nOne departmental level policy that is currently being studied and called for by many citizens and politicians is the use of body cameras by officers.
