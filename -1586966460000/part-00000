This substance ranges in color from white or yellow to purple or pink in mature yams.\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Kaachil cut.jpg|thumb|Purple yam (''D. alata'') freshly harvested and sliced for cross-sectional view]]\nYam crop begins when whole seed tubers or tuber portions are planted into mounds or ridges, at the beginning of the rainy season. The crop yield depends on how and where the sets are planted, sizes of mounds, interplant spacing, provision of stakes for the resultant plants, yam species, and tuber sizes desired at harvest. Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. The seed yams are perishable and bulky to transport. Farmers who do not buy new seed yams usually set aside up to 30% of their harvest for planting the next year. Yam crops face pressure from a range of insect pests and fungal and viral diseases, as well as [[nematode]]. Their growth and dormant phases correspond respectively to the wet season and the dry season. For maximum yield, the yams require a humid tropical environment, with an annual rainfall  over 1500&nbsp;mm distributed uniformly throughout the growing season. White, yellow, and water yams typically produce a single large tuber per year, generally weighing {{convert|5|to|10|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=stofao1 />\n\nDespite the high labor requirements and production costs, consumer demand for yam is high in certain subregions of Africa,<ref name=cabi/> making yam cultivation quite profitable to certain farmers.\n\n=== Major cultivated species ===\nMany cultivated species of ''Dioscorea'' yams are found throughout the humid tropics.<ref name=cabi/> The most economically important are discussed below.<ref name=stofao1>{{cite web|title=Storage and Processing of Roots and Tubers in the Tropics|publisher=Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations|author=Calverly|year=1998|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5415E/x5415e00.htm}}</ref>\n\nNon-''[[Dioscorea]]'' tubers that were historically important in Africa include ''[[Plectranthus rotundifolius]]'' (the Hausa potato) and ''[[Plectranthus esculentus]]'' (the Livingstone potato); these two tuber crops have now been largely displaced by the introduction of [[cassava]].<ref name=\"AfricanPast\">{{Cite book|title=Archaeology, language, and the African past|last=Blench|first=Roger|publisher=Altamira Press|year=2006|isbn=9780759104655|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== ''D. rotundata'' and ''D. cayennensis'' ====\n''[[Dioscorea rotundata]]'', the white yam, and ''[[Dioscorea cayennensis|D. cayennensis]]'', the yellow yam, are native to Africa. They are the most important cultivated yams. In the past, they were considered as two separate species, but most taxonomists now regard them as the same species. Over 200 varieties between them are cultivated.\n\nWhite yam tuber is roughly cylindrical in shape, the skin is smooth and brown, and the flesh is usually white and firm. Yellow yam has yellow flesh, caused by the presence of carotenoids. It looks similar to the white yam in outer appearance; its tuber skin is usually a bit firmer and less extensively grooved. The yellow yam has a longer period of vegetation and a shorter dormancy than white yam.\n\nThe [[Kokoro (vegetable)|Kokoro]] variety is important in making dried yam chips.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dumont |first1=R. |last2=Vernier |first2=P. |year=2000 |doi=10.5367/000000000101293149 |title=Domestication of yams (''Dioscorea cayenensis-rotundata'') within the Bariba ethnic group in Benin |journal=Outlook on Agriculture |volume=29 |issue=2 |page=137}}</ref>\n\nThey are large plants; the vines can be as long as {{convert|10|to|12|m|abbr=on}}.

The Chinese yam plant is somewhat smaller than the African, with the vines about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It is tolerant to frost and can be grown in much cooler conditions than other yams. It is also grown in Korea and Japan.\n\nIt was introduced to Europe in the 19th century, when the [[potato]] crop there was falling victim to disease, and is still grown in France for the Asian food market.\n\nThe tubers are harvested after about 6 months of growth.

It is a large vine, {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} or more in length. It produces tubers, but the [[bulb]]ils which grow at the base of its leaves are the more important food product. They are about the size of potatoes (hence the name \"air potato\"), weighing from {{convert|0.5|to|2.0|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nSome varieties can be eaten raw, while some require soaking or boiling for detoxification before eating. It is not grown much commercially since the flavor of other yams is preferred by most people. However, it is popular in home vegetable gardens because it produces a crop after only four months of growth and continues producing for the life of the vine, as long as two years. Also, the bulbils are easy to harvest and cook.<ref name=\"kay\" />\n\nIn 1905, the air potato was introduced to Florida and has since become an [[invasive species]] in much of the state. Its rapid growth crowds out native vegetation and it is very difficult to remove since it can grow back from the tubers, and new vines can grow from the bulbils even after being cut down or burned.<ref name=\"schultz\" >{{cite web |author=Schultz, G.E. |year=1993 |title=Element Stewardship Abstract for ''Dioscorea bulbifera'', Air potato |url=http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/documnts/diosbul.html |publisher=Nature Conservancy}}</ref>\n\n==== ''D. esculenta'' ====\n[[File:Dioscorea Bild1162.jpg|thumb|Wild bitter yam vines (''D. dumetorum'')]]\n''[[Dioscorea esculenta|D. esculenta]]'', the lesser yam, was one of the first yam species cultivated. It is native to Southeast Asia and is the third-most commonly cultivated species there, although it is cultivated very little in other parts of the world. Its vines seldom reach more than {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and the tubers are fairly small in most varieties.\n\nThe tubers are eaten baked, boiled, or fried much like potatoes. Because of the small size of the tubers, mechanical cultivation is possible, which along with its easy preparation and good flavor, could help the lesser yam to become more popular in the future.<ref name=\"kay\" />\n\n==== ''D. dumetorum'' ====\n''[[Dioscorea dumetorum|D. dumetorum]]'', the bitter yam, is popular as a vegetable in parts of West Africa, in part because their cultivation requires less labor than other yams. The wild forms are very toxic and are sometimes used to poison animals when mixed with bait. It is said{{according to whom|date=December 2019}} that they have also been used for criminal purposes.<ref name=\"kay\" />\n\n==== ''D. trifida'' ====\n''[[Dioscorea trifida|D. trifida]]'', the cush-cush yam, is native to the [[Guyana]] region of South America and is the most important cultivated New World yam. Since they originated in tropical [[rainforest]] conditions, their growth cycle is less related to seasonal changes than other yams.

Yam harvesting is labor-intensive and physically demanding. Tuber harvesting involves standing, bending, [[Squatting position|squatting]], and sometimes sitting on the ground depending on the size of mound, size of tuber, or depth of tuber penetration. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the tuber, because damaged tubers do not store well and spoil rapidly. Some farmers use staking and mixed cropping, a practice that complicates harvesting in some cases.\n\nIn forested areas, tubers grow in areas where other tree roots are present. Harvesting the tuber then involves the additional step of freeing them from other roots. This often causes tuber damage.\n\nAerial tubers or bulbils are harvested by manual plucking from the vine.\n\nYields may improve and cost of yam production be lower if mechanization were to be developed and adopted. However, current crop production practices and species used pose considerable hurdles to successful mechanization of yam production, particularly for small-scale rural farmers. Extensive changes in traditional cultivation practices, such as mixed cropping, may be required.

Nigeria farmed yams on 5.9 million [[hectares]], 70% of the world land area of 8.6 million hectares devoted to yam farming.<ref name=faostat17/>\n\nThe world average annual yield of yams was 8.8 tonnes per hectare in 2017, with [[Ethiopia]] having the most productive farms of 29.2 tonnes per hectare.<ref name=faostat17/>\n\n== Storage ==\n\nRoots and tubers such as yam are living organisms. When stored, they continue to respire, which results in the oxidation of the starch (a polymer of glucose) contained in the cells of the tuber, which converts it into water, carbon dioxide, and heat energy. During this transformation of the starch, the dry matter of the tuber is reduced.\n\nAmongst the major roots and tubers, properly stored yam is considered to be the least perishable. Successful storage of yams requires:<ref name=fao1990a /><ref>{{Cite book |title=Roots, Tubers, and Plantains in Food Security: In Sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America and the Caribbean, in the Pacific |year=1989 |publisher=FAO |isbn=978-92-5-102782-0}}</ref>\n* initial selection of sound and healthy yams\n* proper curing, if possible combined with fungicide treatment\n* adequate ventilation to remove the heat generated by respiration of the tubers\n* regular inspection during storage and removal of rotting tubers and any sprouts that develop\n* protection from direct sunlight and rain\n\nStoring yam at low temperature reduces the respiration rates. However, temperatures below {{convert|12|C}} cause damage through chilling, causing a breakdown of internal tissues, increasing water loss and yam's susceptibility to decay. The symptoms of chilling injury are not always obvious when the tubers are still in cold storage. The injury becomes noticeable as soon as the tubers are restored to ambient temperatures.\n\nThe best temperature to store yams is between {{convert|14|and|16|C}}, with high-technology-controlled humidity and climatic conditions, after a process of curing. Most countries that grow yams as a staple food are too poor to afford high-technology storage systems.\n\nSprouting rapidly increases a tuber's respiration rates, and accelerates the rate at which its food value decreases.<ref name=fao1990a />\n\nCertain cultivars of yams store better than others. The easier to store yams are those adapted to arid climate, where they tend to stay in a dormant low-respiration stage much longer than yam breeds adapted to humid tropical lands, where they do not need dormancy. Yellow yam and cush-cush yam, by nature, have much shorter dormancy periods than water yam, white yam, or lesser yam.\n\nStorage losses for yams are very high in Africa, with insects alone causing over 25% harvest loss within four months.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritionalvalue\n| name=Yam, raw\n| kJ=494\n| protein=1.5 g\n| fat=0.17 g\n| carbs=27.9 g\n| fiber=4.1 g\n| sugars= 0.5 g\n| calcium_mg=17\n| iron_mg=0.54\n| magnesium_mg=21\n| phosphorus_mg=55\n| potassium_mg=816\n| zinc_mg=0.24\n| manganese_mg=0.397\n| vitC_mg= 17.1\n| thiamin_mg=0.112\n| riboflavin_mg=0.032\n| niacin_mg=0.552\n| pantothenic_mg=0.314\n| vitB6_mg=0.293\n| folate_ug=23\n| vitA_ug = 7\n| vitE_mg=0.35\n| vitK_ug = 2.3\n| source_usda=1\n| note={{cite web |url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11601&format=Full |title=Link to USDA Database entry}}\n}}\n\nRaw yam has only moderate [[nutrient density]], with ''appreciable content'' (10% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) limited to [[potassium]], [[vitamin B6]], [[manganese]], [[thiamin]], [[dietary fiber]], and [[vitamin C]] (table).<ref>{{cite book|title=Postharvest technology and commodity marketing: Proceedings of a postharvest conference |year=1998 |isbn=978-978-131-111-6 |page=172 |author=Uwaegbute, Osho and Obatolu|publisher=International Institute of Tropical Agriculture}}</ref> But raw yam has the highest potassium levels amongst the 10 major staple foods of the world ([[Yam (vegetable)#Comparison to other staple foods|see nutritional chart]]).

The boiled yam can also be pounded with a traditional mortar and pestle to create a thick, starchy paste known as ''[[iyan]]'' (pounded yam) or ''[[fufu]]'' which is eaten with traditional sauces such as ''[[egusi]]'' and [[Oil palm|palm nut]] soup.\n\nAnother method of consumption is to leave the raw yam pieces to [[Drying (food)|dry in the sun]]. When dry, the pieces turn a dark brown color. These are then milled to create a brown powder known in Nigeria as ''elubo''. The powder can be mixed with boiling water to create a thick starchy paste, a kind of pudding known as [[amala (food)|''amala'']], which is then eaten with local soups and sauces.\n\nYams are a primary agricultural and culturally important [[commodity]] in [[West Africa]],<ref name=bmgf/> where over 95% of the world's yam crop is harvested. Yams are still important for survival in these regions. Some varieties of these tubers can be stored up to six months without refrigeration, which makes them a valuable resource for the yearly period of food scarcity at the beginning of the [[rainy season|wet season]]. Yam cultivars are also cultivated in other humid tropical countries.<ref name=cabi/>\n\nYam is the main staple crop of the [[Igbo people|Igbos]] in south eastern Nigeria where for centuries it played a dominant role in both their agricultural and cultural life. It is celebrated with annual [[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|yam festivals]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nYams are particularly consumed in the coastal area of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast region]], although they can be found in other parts of the country. In [[Pernambuco]] state, it is usually boiled and served cut in slices at breakfast, along with [[Requeij\u00e3o|cheese spread]] or [[molasses]].\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Vanuatu march\u00e9 igname.JPG|thumb|Yams at [[Port-Vila]] market ([[Vanuatu]])]]\n[[File:Ube Cake.jpg|thumb|right|A piece of cake made with ube (purple yam; [[Philippines]])]]\n\nIn the Philippines, the purple ''ube'' species of yam (''[[Dioscorea alata]]''), is eaten as a sweetened dessert called ''ube halaya'', and is also used as an ingredient in another Filipino dessert, ''[[halo-halo]]''. It is also used as a popular ingredient for ice cream.\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nIn Vietnam, the same purple yam is used for preparing a special type of soup ''canh khoai m\u1ee1'' or fatty yam soup. This involves mashing the yam and cooking it until very well done. The yam root was traditionally used by peasants in Vietnam to dye cotton clothes throughout the Red River and Mekong delta regions as late as the mid-20th century, and is still used by others in the [[Sa Pa District|Sapa region]] of northern Vietnam.<ref>[https://kilomet109.com/our-ingredients-the-yam-root/ Yam Root Dye]</ref>\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn Indonesia, the same purple yam is used for preparing desserts.

White- and off-white-fleshed yams are cut in cubes, cooked, lightly fermented, and eaten as afternoon snacks.\n\n=== Japan ===\n[[File:Yamakake.JPG|thumb|right|''Yamakake'' is a yam-based Japanese dish prepared from [[Dioscorea polystachya|''tororo'']] (''D. polystachya'') and ''[[maguro]]'' (tuna).]] An exception to the cooking rule is the mountain yam (''[[Dioscorea polystachya]]''), known as ''nagaimo'' and can be further classified into ''ich\u014dimo'' (lit. 'ginkgo-leaf yam'; kanji: \u9280\u674f\u828b), or ''yamatoimo'' (lit. Yamato yam; kanji: [[wikt:\u5927\u548c\u828b|\u5927\u548c\u828b]]), depending on the root shape.\n\nMountain yam is eaten raw and grated, after only a relatively minimal preparation: the whole tubers are briefly soaked in a vinegar-water solution to neutralize irritant [[oxalate]] crystals found in their skin. The raw vegetable is starchy and bland, [[mucilaginous]] when grated, and may be eaten plain as a side dish, or added to noodles.\n\nAnother variety of yam, ''jinenjo'', is used in Japan as an ingredient in soba noodles. In Okinawa, purple yams (''[[Dioscorea alata]]'') are grown. This purple yam is popular as lightly deep-fried tempura, as well as being grilled or boiled. Additionally, the purple yam is a common ingredient of yam ice cream with the signature purple color. Purple yam is also used in other types of traditional ''[[wagashi]]'' sweets, cakes, and candy.\n\n=== India ===\nIn central parts of India, the yam is prepared by being finely sliced, seasoned with spices, and deep fried. In southern parts of India in Tamil, the vegetable is a popular accompaniment to rice dishes and fish curry. The purple yam, ''D. alata'', is also eaten in India, where it is also called the violet yam.\n\n=== Nepal ===\n''Dioscorea ''root is traditionally eaten on ''M\u0101gh Sankr\u0101nti'' (a midwinter festival) in Nepal.

However, there are exceptions. Bitter compounds tend to accumulate in immature tuber tissues of white and yellow yams. These may be polyphenols or [[tannin]]-like compounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWild forms of bitter yams (''[[Dioscorea dumetorum]]'') do contain some toxins, such as [[dihydrodioscorine]], that taste bitter, hence are referred to as bitter yam.<ref>[http://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Dioscorea+dumetorum ''Dioscorea dumetorum'': Useful Tropical Plants]</ref> Bitter yams are not normally eaten except at times of desperation in poor countries and in times of local food scarcity. They are usually detoxified by soaking in a vessel of salt water, in cold or hot fresh water or in a stream. The bitter compounds in these yams are water-soluble alkaloids which, on ingestion, produce severe and distressing symptoms. Severe cases of alkaloid intoxication may prove fatal.\n\nAerial or potato yams have antinutritional factors. In Asia, detoxification methods, involving water extraction, fermentation, and roasting of the grated tuber, are used for bitter cultivars of this yam.

The skins vary in color from dark brown to light pink. The majority of the vegetable is composed of a much softer substance known as the \"meat\". This substance ranges in color from white or yellow to purple or pink in mature yams.\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Kaachil cut.jpg|thumb|Purple yam (''D. alata'') freshly harvested and sliced for cross-sectional view]]\nYam crop begins when whole seed tubers or tuber portions are planted into mounds or ridges, at the beginning of the rainy season. The crop yield depends on how and where the sets are planted, sizes of mounds, interplant spacing, provision of stakes for the resultant plants, yam species, and tuber sizes desired at harvest. Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. The seed yams are perishable and bulky to transport. Farmers who do not buy new seed yams usually set aside up to 30% of their harvest for planting the next year. Yam crops face pressure from a range of insect pests and fungal and viral diseases, as well as [[nematode]]. Their growth and dormant phases correspond respectively to the wet season and the dry season. For maximum yield, the yams require a humid tropical environment, with an annual rainfall  over 1500&nbsp;mm distributed uniformly throughout the growing season. White, yellow, and water yams typically produce a single large tuber per year, generally weighing {{convert|5|to|10|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=stofao1 />\n\nDespite the high labor requirements and production costs, consumer demand for yam is high in certain subregions of Africa,<ref name=cabi/> making yam cultivation quite profitable to certain farmers.\n\n=== Major cultivated species ===\nMany cultivated species of ''Dioscorea'' yams are found throughout the humid tropics.<ref name=cabi/> The most economically important are discussed below.<ref name=stofao1>{{cite web|title=Storage and Processing of Roots and Tubers in the Tropics|publisher=Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations|author=Calverly|year=1998|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5415E/x5415e00.htm}}</ref>\n\nNon-''[[Dioscorea]]'' tubers that were historically important in Africa include ''[[Plectranthus rotundifolius]]'' (the Hausa potato) and ''[[Plectranthus esculentus]]'' (the Livingstone potato); these two tuber crops have now been largely displaced by the introduction of [[cassava]].<ref name=\"AfricanPast\">{{Cite book|title=Archaeology, language, and the African past|last=Blench|first=Roger|publisher=Altamira Press|year=2006|isbn=9780759104655|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== ''D. rotundata'' and ''D. cayennensis'' ====\n''[[Dioscorea rotundata]]'', the white yam, and ''[[Dioscorea cayennensis|D. cayennensis]]'', the yellow yam, are native to Africa.

It is not grown much commercially since the flavor of other yams is preferred by most people.

Yam harvesting is labor-intensive and physically demanding. Tuber harvesting involves standing, bending, [[Squatting position|squatting]], and sometimes sitting on the ground depending on the size of mound, size of tuber, or depth of tuber penetration. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the tuber, because damaged tubers do not store well and spoil rapidly. Some farmers use staking and mixed cropping, a practice that complicates harvesting in some cases.\n\nIn forested areas, tubers grow in areas where other tree roots are present. Harvesting the tuber then involves the additional step of freeing them from other roots. This often causes tuber damage.\n\nAerial tubers or bulbils are harvested by manual plucking from the vine.\n\nYields may improve and cost of yam production be lower if mechanization were to be developed and adopted. However, current crop production practices and species used pose considerable hurdles to successful mechanization of yam production, particularly for small-scale rural farmers. Extensive changes in traditional cultivation practices, such as mixed cropping, may be required. Modification of current tuber harvesting equipment is necessary given yam tuber architecture and its different physical properties.<ref name=opara>{{cite web |title=YAMS: Post-Harvest Operation |author=Linus Opara |year=2003 |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/inpho/docs/Post_Harvest_Compendium_-_Yams.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n{{further|Yam production in Nigeria}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em\"\n|+ Yam production - 2017\n!

Nigeria farmed yams on 5.9 million [[hectares]], 70% of the world land area of 8.6 million hectares devoted to yam farming.<ref name=faostat17/>\n\nThe world average annual yield of yams was 8.8 tonnes per hectare in 2017, with [[Ethiopia]] having the most productive farms of 29.2 tonnes per hectare.<ref name=faostat17/>\n\n== Storage ==\n\nRoots and tubers such as yam are living organisms. When stored, they continue to respire, which results in the oxidation of the starch (a polymer of glucose) contained in the cells of the tuber, which converts it into water, carbon dioxide, and heat energy. During this transformation of the starch, the dry matter of the tuber is reduced.\n\nAmongst the major roots and tubers, properly stored yam is considered to be the least perishable. Successful storage of yams requires:<ref name=fao1990a /><ref>{{Cite book |title=Roots, Tubers, and Plantains in Food Security: In Sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America and the Caribbean, in the Pacific |year=1989 |publisher=FAO |isbn=978-92-5-102782-0}}</ref>\n* initial selection of sound and healthy yams\n* proper curing, if possible combined with fungicide treatment\n* adequate ventilation to remove the heat generated by respiration of the tubers\n* regular inspection during storage and removal of rotting tubers and any sprouts that develop\n* protection from direct sunlight and rain\n\nStoring yam at low temperature reduces the respiration rates. However, temperatures below {{convert|12|C}} cause damage through chilling, causing a breakdown of internal tissues, increasing water loss and yam's susceptibility to decay. The symptoms of chilling injury are not always obvious when the tubers are still in cold storage. The injury becomes noticeable as soon as the tubers are restored to ambient temperatures.\n\nThe best temperature to store yams is between {{convert|14|and|16|C}}, with high-technology-controlled humidity and climatic conditions, after a process of curing. Most countries that grow yams as a staple food are too poor to afford high-technology storage systems.\n\nSprouting rapidly increases a tuber's respiration rates, and accelerates the rate at which its food value decreases.<ref name=fao1990a />\n\nCertain cultivars of yams store better than others. The easier to store yams are those adapted to arid climate, where they tend to stay in a dormant low-respiration stage much longer than yam breeds adapted to humid tropical lands, where they do not need dormancy. Yellow yam and cush-cush yam, by nature, have much shorter dormancy periods than water yam, white yam, or lesser yam.\n\nStorage losses for yams are very high in Africa, with insects alone causing over 25% harvest loss within four months.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritionalvalue\n| name=Yam, raw\n| kJ=494\n| protein=1.5 g\n| fat=0.17 g\n| carbs=27.9 g\n| fiber=4.1 g\n| sugars= 0.5 g\n| calcium_mg=17\n| iron_mg=0.54\n| magnesium_mg=21\n| phosphorus_mg=55\n| potassium_mg=816\n| zinc_mg=0.24\n| manganese_mg=0.397\n| vitC_mg= 17.1\n| thiamin_mg=0.112\n| riboflavin_mg=0.032\n| niacin_mg=0.552\n| pantothenic_mg=0.314\n| vitB6_mg=0.293\n| folate_ug=23\n| vitA_ug = 7\n| vitE_mg=0.35\n| vitK_ug = 2.3\n| source_usda=1\n| note={{cite web |url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11601&format=Full |title=Link to USDA Database entry}}\n}}\n\nRaw yam has only moderate [[nutrient density]], with ''appreciable content'' (10% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) limited to [[potassium]], [[vitamin B6]], [[manganese]], [[thiamin]], [[dietary fiber]], and [[vitamin C]] (table).<ref>{{cite book|title=Postharvest technology and commodity marketing: Proceedings of a postharvest conference |year=1998 |isbn=978-978-131-111-6 |page=172 |author=Uwaegbute, Osho and Obatolu|publisher=International Institute of Tropical Agriculture}}</ref> But raw yam has the highest potassium levels amongst the 10 major staple foods of the world ([[Yam (vegetable)#Comparison to other staple foods|see nutritional chart]]).

The resulting mixture is served with a heated sauce, such as [[Tomato sauce|tomato]] and [[Chili sauce|chili]], poured onto it.\n\nSkinned and cut frozen yams may also be available from specialty grocers.\n\n== Toxicity ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\n\nUnlike [[cassava]], most varieties of edible, mature, cultivated yam do not contain toxic compounds. However, there are exceptions. Bitter compounds tend to accumulate in immature tuber tissues of white and yellow yams. These may be polyphenols or [[tannin]]-like compounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWild forms of bitter yams (''[[Dioscorea dumetorum]]'') do contain some toxins, such as [[dihydrodioscorine]], that taste bitter, hence are referred to as bitter yam.<ref>[http://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Dioscorea+dumetorum ''Dioscorea dumetorum'': Useful Tropical Plants]</ref> Bitter yams are not normally eaten except at times of desperation in poor countries and in times of local food scarcity. They are usually detoxified by soaking in a vessel of salt water, in cold or hot fresh water or in a stream. The bitter compounds in these yams are water-soluble alkaloids which, on ingestion, produce severe and distressing symptoms. Severe cases of alkaloid intoxication may prove fatal.\n\nAerial or potato yams have antinutritional factors. In Asia, detoxification methods, involving water extraction, fermentation, and roasting of the grated tuber, are used for bitter cultivars of this yam. The bitter compounds in yams also known locally as air potato include diosbulbin and possibly [[saponin]]s, such as [[diosgenin]].<ref name=jesus/> In Indonesia, an extract of air potato is used in the preparation of arrow poison.<ref name=fao1990a>{{cite book |title=Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition |publisher=FAO |year=1990 |author1=Oke, O.L. |editor1=Redhead, J. |editor2=Hussain, M.A. |isbn=978-92-5-102862-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/rootstubersplant0000unse |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n== Cultural aspects ==\n[[File:Ashanti Yam Ceremony 1817.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Ashanti yam ceremony in Ghana has been part of the local history, shown in this 1817 painting of a yam ceremony]]\n=== Nigeria and Ghana ===\nA yam festival is usually held in the beginning of August at the end of the rainy season.

This is their way of giving thanks to the spirits above them.\n\n==== New Yam Festival ====\n\nThe New Yam Festival celebrates the main agricultural crop of the [[Igbo people|Igbos]], Idomas, and Tivs. The New Yam Festival, known as ''Orureshi'' in Owukpa in Idoma west and ''Ima-Ji'', ''Iri-Ji'' or ''Iwa Ji'' in Igbo land, is a celebration depicting the prominence of yam in social and cultural life. The festival is prominent among southeastern states and major tribes in [[Benue State]], mainly around August.\n\n=== Other ===\nHistorical records in West Africa and of African yams in Europe date back to the 16th&nbsp;century.

Their cultivation and harvesting is accompanied by complex rituals and taboos.

Several technical approaches have been proposed, but there has been no legal framework to date that has required satellite operators to clean up the [[negative externality]] of their derelict satellites. New approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the cost of object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down [[launch license]] regime to Earth orbits that would require satellite operators to remove one spacecraft for each one deployed.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p13 >{{cite web |last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2014-06-14 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |pages=13\u201314 |quote=''for disposing of these obsolete or derelict spacecraft all [approaches] involve the expenditure of substantially more delta-V than what has been traditional.

Because they were now unable to rely on slave labor as a means of producing income, Dr. Felton returned to farming as a way to earn income until there was enough money to open a school.

Upon her entrance into the public realm independent of her husband's political career in the late Nineteenth century, Rebecca Felton attempted to employ elite men to help elite women achieve equal status in society. She believed that it was necessary for men to be held accountable, and during her 1887 address at the Women's Christian Temperance Union state convention, she argued that women were actively fulfilling their duties as wives and mothers, but men undervalued their importance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Felton |first1=Rebecca Latimer |title=Country Life in the Days of my Youth |date=1919 |publisher=Index Printing Company |location=Atlanta, Georgia |page=294}}</ref> She argued that women should have more power inside of the home with more influence on the decision making process, proper education should be provided for both wives and daughters, women should have economic independence through this education, training, and later employment and women should have more influence over the children.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whites |first1=LeeAnn |title=Gender Matters: Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Making of the New South |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, New York |page=181}}</ref> In 1898, Rebecca Felton wrote \"Textile Education for Georgia Girls\" as an attempt to convince Georgia legislators that education for girls was necessary. In this article, she argued that it was a man's responsibility to take care of his wife and children. Therefore, it was his responsibility to ensure his daughter had equal rights and opportunities to his sons.<ref>Mrs. W.H. Felton. \"Textile Education for Georgia Girls\", in Hargrett Rare Books and Manuscript Library, UGA, Manuscript Collection 81</ref>\n\nHowever, this strategy was not working and in 1900 Rebecca Latimer Felton officially joined the Women's Suffrage Movement. This move led her to work tirelessly for white women's rights, including the right to vote, the Progressive Movement, free public education for women, and admittance into public universities for more than thirty.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |title=More than Petticoats |pages=52\u201353}}</ref> A prominent activist for [[women's suffrage]] in Georgia, Felton found many opponents in anti-suffragist Georgians such as [[Mildred Lewis Rutherford]]. During a 1915 debate with Rutherford and other anti-suffragists before the Georgia legislative committee, the chairman allowed each of the anti-suffragists to speak for 45 minutes but demanded Felton stop speaking after 30 minutes.  Felton ignored him and spoke for an extra 15 minutes, at one point making fun of Rutherford and implicitly accusing her of hypocrisy. However, the Georgia legislative committee did not pass the suffrage bill.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips LaCavera |first=Tommie|title=Among Clarke County's notable women were first black female education administrator; vocal opponent of women's suffrage|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/103001/ath_women.shtml|newspaper=Athens Banner-Herald|date=October 30, 2001}}</ref> Georgia was later the first state to reject the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] when it was proposed in 1919, and unlike most other states in the Union, Georgia did not allow women to vote in the 1920 presidential election.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Donald L.|title=The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia|year=2001|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.|isbn=978-0-8203-2329-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zpmjRm4cdswC&pg=PA335&lpg=PA335&dq=women+georgia+1920+election+presidential#PPA335,M1|author2=Grant, Jonathan |page=335}}</ref> Women in Georgia were not given the right to vote until 1922.\n\nFelton criticized what she saw as the hypocrisy of Southern men who boasted of superior Southern \"chivalry\" but opposed women's rights, and she expressed her dislike of the fact that Southern states resisted white women's suffrage longer than other regions of the US. She wrote, in 1915, that women were denied fair political participation\n\n<blockquote>except in the States which have been franchised by the good sense and common honesty of the men of those States\u2014after due consideration, and with the chivalric instinct that differentiates the coarse brutal male from the gentlemen of our nation.

She was  sworn in  November 21, 1922, and served just 24 hours. At 87 years, nine months, and 22 days old, she was the oldest freshman senator to enter the Senate. She was the only woman to have served as a [[list of United States Senators from Georgia|Senator from Georgia]] until January 6, 2020, when [[Kelly Loeffler]] was appointed by Governor [[Brian Kemp]] to the seat vacated by the retirement of Sen. [[Johnny Isakson]] at the end of 2019. Her husband [[William Harrell Felton]] was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[Georgia House of Representatives]] and she ran his campaigns. She was a prominent society woman; an advocate of prison reform, [[women's suffrage]] and educational modernization; a [[white supremacist]] and [[slave owner]]; and a woman who spoke vigorously in favor of [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]]. Numan Bartley wrote that by 1915 she \"was championing a lengthy feminist program that ranged from prohibition to [[equal pay for equal work]].\"<ref>Numan Bartley, ''The Creation of Modern Georgia'' (1983) p 121</ref>\n\n==Early life ==\nFelton was born in [[Decatur, Georgia]] on June 10, 1835. She was the daughter of Charles Latimer, a prosperous planter, merchant, general store owner. Charles was a Maryland native who moved to [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] in the 1820s, and his wife, Eleanor Swift Latimer, was from [[Morgan, Georgia]]. Felton was the oldest of four children; her sister, Mary Latimer, also became prominent in women's reforms in the early 20th century. When she was 15, her father sent her to live with relatives in the town of [[Madison, Georgia|Madison]] where she attended a private school within a local Presbyterian church.  She then went on to attend Madison Female College, from which she received a classical liberal arts education.<ref>{{Cite book|title=More Than Petticoats: Remarkable Georgia Women|last=Martin |first=Sara Hines|date=2002|publisher=TwoDot|isbn=9780762712700|location=Guilford, Connecticut|url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/morethanpetticoa0000mart}}</ref> She graduated at the top of her class at age 17 in 1852.<ref name=\"1972- 2009\">{{Cite book|title=Southern horrors : women and the politics of rape and lynching|last=1972\u2013|first=Feimster, Crystal Nicole|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674061859 |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=318876104}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she married Dr. [[William Harrell Felton]] at her home and moved to live with him on his plantation just north of [[Cartersville, Georgia]]. She gave birth to five children, one daughter and four sons. Only one, Howard Erwin Felton, survived childhood. In the aftermath of the Civil War, their plantation was destroyed.  Because they were now unable to rely on slave labor as a means of producing income, Dr. Felton returned to farming as a way to earn income until there was enough money to open a school.  Felton and her husband opened Felton Academy in [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]], where she and her husband both taught.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Felton |first1=Rebecca Latimer |title=The Romantic Story of Georgia's Women |date=1930 |publisher=Atlanta Georgian and Sunday American |location=Atlanta, Georgia}}</ref>\n\n==Women's suffrage ==\nBy joining the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] in 1886, Rebecca Latimer Felton was able to achieve stature as a speaker for equal rights for white women. Upon her entrance into the public realm independent of her husband's political career in the late Nineteenth century, Rebecca Felton attempted to employ elite men to help elite women achieve equal status in society. She believed that it was necessary for men to be held accountable, and during her 1887 address at the Women's Christian Temperance Union state convention, she argued that women were actively fulfilling their duties as wives and mothers, but men undervalued their importance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Felton |first1=Rebecca Latimer |title=Country Life in the Days of my Youth |date=1919 |publisher=Index Printing Company |location=Atlanta, Georgia |page=294}}</ref> She argued that women should have more power inside of the home with more influence on the decision making process, proper education should be provided for both wives and daughters, women should have economic independence through this education, training, and later employment and women should have more influence over the children.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whites |first1=LeeAnn |title=Gender Matters: Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Making of the New South |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, New York |page=181}}</ref> In 1898, Rebecca Felton wrote \"Textile Education for Georgia Girls\" as an attempt to convince Georgia legislators that education for girls was necessary. In this article, she argued that it was a man's responsibility to take care of his wife and children. Therefore, it was his responsibility to ensure his daughter had equal rights and opportunities to his sons.<ref>Mrs. W.H. Felton. \"Textile Education for Georgia Girls\", in Hargrett Rare Books and Manuscript Library, UGA, Manuscript Collection 81</ref>\n\nHowever, this strategy was not working and in 1900 Rebecca Latimer Felton officially joined the Women's Suffrage Movement. This move led her to work tirelessly for white women's rights, including the right to vote, the Progressive Movement, free public education for women, and admittance into public universities for more than thirty.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |title=More than Petticoats |pages=52\u201353}}</ref> A prominent activist for [[women's suffrage]] in Georgia, Felton found many opponents in anti-suffragist Georgians such as [[Mildred Lewis Rutherford]]. During a 1915 debate with Rutherford and other anti-suffragists before the Georgia legislative committee, the chairman allowed each of the anti-suffragists to speak for 45 minutes but demanded Felton stop speaking after 30 minutes.  Felton ignored him and spoke for an extra 15 minutes, at one point making fun of Rutherford and implicitly accusing her of hypocrisy. However, the Georgia legislative committee did not pass the suffrage bill.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips LaCavera |first=Tommie|title=Among Clarke County's notable women were first black female education administrator; vocal opponent of women's suffrage|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/103001/ath_women.shtml|newspaper=Athens Banner-Herald|date=October 30, 2001}}</ref> Georgia was later the first state to reject the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] when it was proposed in 1919, and unlike most other states in the Union, Georgia did not allow women to vote in the 1920 presidential election.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Donald L.|title=The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia|year=2001|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.|isbn=978-0-8203-2329-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zpmjRm4cdswC&pg=PA335&lpg=PA335&dq=women+georgia+1920+election+presidential#PPA335,M1|author2=Grant, Jonathan |page=335}}</ref> Women in Georgia were not given the right to vote until 1922.\n\nFelton criticized what she saw as the hypocrisy of Southern men who boasted of superior Southern \"chivalry\" but opposed women's rights, and she expressed her dislike of the fact that Southern states resisted white women's suffrage longer than other regions of the US. She wrote, in 1915, that women were denied fair political participation\n\n<blockquote>except in the States which have been franchised by the good sense and common honesty of the men of those States\u2014after due consideration, and with the chivalric instinct that differentiates the coarse brutal male from the gentlemen of our nation.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. Steered by two [[ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] to its north, the depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, with warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg); this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. The hurricane passed west of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n===Records===\nAt 18:01&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[dropsonde]] measured a barometric pressure of {{convert|884|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma, along with sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h); the wind value suggested that the central pressure was slightly lower, estimated at {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. Steered by two [[ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] to its north, the depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, with warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg); this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. The hurricane passed west of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n===Records===\nAt 18:01&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[dropsonde]] measured a barometric pressure of {{convert|884|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma, along with sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h); the wind value suggested that the central pressure was slightly lower, estimated at {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.

It was annexed by Barcelona in the year 1897. It is situated in the upper part of this district and before it was named Camp de '''l'Arca'''.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of Camp de l'Arpa is probably derived from the existence of a [[dolmen]] in this area. This dolmen was cited in a document of the year 1037 in an official document of [[Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s|Sant Cugat]], with the Latin phrase \"ad ipsa archa\", in a dispute of the limits. The current name would be a linguistic deformation of the original.\n\n==History==\nCamp de L'Arpa, a part of the original neighborhood of Muntanya (mountain in Catalan) of  [[Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als]], was started to be built in 1845 without being included later in [[Ildefons Cerd\u00e0|Cerd\u00e0's urban plan]]. For that reason even today the conserved street structure is very different from the typical squared one of the near [[Eixample]]. During the 19th century both Camp de l'Arpa as well as [[El Clot]] saw the construction of the factories like flour mills, brick manufacturies, textile industries and chemical industries, to name a few. At the end of 19th century the two neighborhoods had already strongly changed their appearance and lost a big part of their rural aspect, which characterized them earlier. They obtained in a few decades the aspect of an industrial  center and worker housing due to considerable immigration from all parts of Catalonia and Aragon. It is in that time of big changes that the new social demands create a new vital network of associations which characterized El Clot and Camp de l'Arpa, with some of them still being active until now, such as Foment Martinenc, l'Orfe\u00f3 Martinenc i la Formiga Martinenca.\n\nAnother important element of the history of El Clot and Camp de l'Arpa in the 19th century was the construction of the train track and the station of El Clot, today completely underground. During the 20th century, along the course of the old train track the Meridiana avenue was opened, which still divides the two neighborhoods. In the place of the old Renfe station of Clot now can be found the El Clot park.\nIn the last time Camp de l'Arpa has changed a lot losing much of its industrial base and working class, converting itself in a residential area around the testimonies giving evidence of its past. Examples are  buildings such as the old Escola d'Arts i Oficis which today hosts the secondary school called IES Zafra or the old factory Alchemika, which now accommodates a modern public library and as well apartment blocks, which imitate the elegant Eixample buildings and others smaller and more modest ones, which are remaining specially in the smaller narrow streets (called in Catalan passatges) of Camp de l'Arpa, authentic parts which have survived from the 19th into the 21st century, such as Andrev\u00ed, Aloi, Constancia, Pisto, Puigmadrona, Sospir, all of them very close to [[Passeig Maragall]].\n\n==Geography==\nIt's situated in the upper part of Sant Mart\u00ed district, at the border of the area which Cerd\u00e0's Plan of 1859 wanted to develop. It's bordered by the [[Avinguda Meridiana]], [[Carrer d'Arag\u00f3, Barcelona|Carrer d'Arag\u00f3]], Dos de Maig street, [[Anthony Mary Claret]] street and [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa|Las Navas de Tolosa]] street.\nThe Camp de l'Arpa neighborhood did not obey the Eixample plan of [[Ildefons Cerd\u00e0]]. As a result, the majority of the new streets don't follow the proposals of the Cerdas's Plan when arriving in the neighborhood. For that reason the streets of Corcega, Rosello, Proven\u00e7a end at crossing with [[Elies Rogent|Rogent]] street\nThis duality is reflected by the types of buildings: on one hand modest worker housing and on the other hand the typical housing model of the Eixample.\n\n{{Barcelona}}\n\n{{coord|41|24|41.16|N|2|10|57|E|type:city_region:ES-CT|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Camp de l'Arpa del Clot, el}}\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods of Barcelona]]\n[[Category:Sant Mart\u00ed]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = El Camp de l'Arpa del Clot\n| native_name             =\n| native_name_lang        = \n| settlement_type         = [[Districts of Barcelona|Neighbourhood of Barcelona]]\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_alt               =\n| image_caption           = \n| image_flag              =\n| flag_alt                =\n| image_seal              =\n| seal_alt                =\n| image_shield            =\n| shield_alt              =\n| nickname                =\n| motto                   =\n| mottoeng                =\n| image_map               =\n| map_alt                 =\n| map_caption             =\n| pushpin_map             =\n| pushpin_label_position  =\n| pushpin_map_alt         =\n| pushpin_map_caption     =\n| coordinates             = \n| coor_pinpoint           =\n| coordinates_footnotes   =\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{Flag|Spain}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]]\n| subdivision_name1       = {{Flag|Catalonia}} \n| subdivision_type2       = [[Provinces of Spain|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2       = {{flag|Province of Barcelona|name=Barcelona}}\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Comarques of Catalonia|Comarca]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Barcelon\u00e8s]]\n| subdivision_type4       = [[Municipalities of Spain|Municipality]]\n| subdivision_name4       = {{Flag|Barcelona}}\n| subdivision_type5       = [[Districts of Barcelona|District]]\n| subdivision_name5       = [[Sant Mart\u00ed (district)|Sant Mart\u00ed]]\n| established_title       =\n| established_date        =\n| parts_type              = \n| parts_style             = \n| parts                   =\n| founder                 =\n| seat_type               =\n| seat                    =\n| government_footnotes    =\n| leader_party            =\n| leader_title            =\n| leader_name             =\n| unit_pref               = Metric<!-- or US or UK -->\n| area_footnotes          =\n| area_total_km2          = \n| area_land_km2           =\n| area_water_km2          =\n| area_water_percent      =\n| area_note               =\n| elevation_footnotes     =\n| elevation_m             =\n| population_footnotes    =\n| population_total        = 38,104\n| population_as_of        = 2016\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      =\n| population_note         =\n| timezone1               =\n| utc_offset1             =\n| timezone1_DST           =\n| utc_offset1_DST         =\n|postal_code_type       =  <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              =\n| website                 =\n| footnotes               =\n}}\n\n'''El Camp de l'Arpa del Clot''' (name designated in 2006) is one of the ten neighborhoods of [[Barcelona]] which compose the district of ''[[Sant Mart\u00ed (district)|Sant Mart\u00ed]]'', [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]).
