Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 and [[Test cricket]] began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after [[association football]] (soccer). Governance is by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.\n\n==Early cricket==\n{{main|History of cricket to 1725}}{{Cricket sidebar |expanded=all}}\n\n===Origin===\nCricket was probably created during [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] or [[Normans|Norman]] times by children living in the [[Weald]], an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].<ref name=\"PWT\">{{cite book |last=Wynne-Thomas |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Wynne-Thomas |title=From the Weald to the World |year=1997 |publisher=Stationery Office Books}}</ref> The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\"]] Julian date, the year equating to 1598 in the modern calendar).\n\nThere have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 1300 and concerns the future [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] playing at \"creag and other games\" in both [[Westminster]] and [[Newenden]]. It has been suggested that \"creag\" was an [[Early Modern English|Olde English]] word for cricket but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of \"[[craic]]\", meaning \"fun and games in general\".<ref name=\"HSA\">{{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.S. |authorlink=H. S. Altham |title=A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914) |year=1962 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin}}</ref>\n\nIt is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from [[bowls]], assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a [[wicket gate]]) as the wicket.<ref name=\"DB\">{{cite book |last=Birley |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Birley |title=A Social History of English Cricket |year=1999 |publisher=Aurum}}</ref>\n\n===First definite reference===\n[[Image:RGS old building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|John Derrick was a pupil at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]], then the Free School, in Guildford when he and his friends played ''creckett'' circa 1550]]  \n \nA 1597 (Old Style \u2013 1598 New Style) court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] mentions the game of ''creckett''. A 59-year-old coroner, [[John Derrick]], testified that he and his school friends had played ''creckett'' on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Free School]]. Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey ''circa'' 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.<ref name=\"HSA21\">Altham, p. 21.</ref><ref>Underdown, p. 3.</ref>\n\nThe first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.<ref name=\"TJM\">McCann, p. xxxi.</ref> In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Derivation of the name of \"cricket\"===\nA number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference,it was spelled ''creckett''. The name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''krick''(''-e''), meaning a stick; or the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff, or the [[French language|French]] word ''criquet'' meaning a wooden post.<ref name=\"DB\"/> The Middle Dutch word ''krickstoel'' means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.<ref>Bowen, p. 33.</ref> According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the [[University of Bonn]], \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for [[hockey]], ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").<ref name=\"Terry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |title=The Seventeenth Century Game of Cricket: A Reconstruction of the Game |last=Terry |first=David |publisher=SportsLibrary |date=2008 |accessdate=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621011709/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |archivedate=21 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the [[County of Flanders]], especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], many Middle Dutch<ref>Middle Dutch was the language in use in Flanders at the time.</ref> words found their way into southern English dialects.<ref name=RB>[[Rowland Bowen]], ''Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development'', Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1970</ref>\n\n===Early 17th century===\nA number of references occur up to the [[English Civil War]] and these indicate that cricket had become an adult game contested by parish teams, but there is no evidence of county strength teams at this time. Equally, there is little evidence of the rampant gambling that characterised the game throughout the 18th century. It is generally believed, therefore, that [[village cricket]] had developed by the middle of the 17th century but that county cricket had not and that investment in the game had not begun.<ref name=LL>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html ''From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300\u20131787'']</ref>\n\n===The Commonwealth===\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government clamped down on \"unlawful assemblies\", in particular the more raucous sports such as football. Their laws also demanded a stricter observance of the Sabbath than there had been previously. As the Sabbath was the only free time available to the lower classes, cricket's popularity may have waned during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]]. There is no actual evidence that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s regime banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the [[interregnum]] that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did not cause any \"breach of the Sabbath\".<ref name=LL/> It is believed that the nobility in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village games.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Gambling and press coverage===\nCricket certainly thrived after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the \"Cavalier\" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to \u00a3100, although that was still a fortune at the time,<ref name=LL/> equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|100|1664|r=-3}}}} in present-day terms {{inflation-fn|UK}}. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a \"great match\" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] a side.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nWith [[freedom of the press]] having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.<ref name=LL/>\n\n==18th century cricket==\n{{See also|History of cricket to 1725|History of cricket (1726\u201340)}}\n\n===Patronage and players===\nGambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first \"county teams\" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing \"local experts\" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/> The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.\n\nThe most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|the 2nd Duke of Richmond]], [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]], [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]] and [[Edwin Stead]]. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like [[Thomas Waymark]].\n\n===Cricket expands beyond England===\nCricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century,<ref name=RB/> probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the [[West Indies]] by colonists<ref name=RB/> and to India by [[British East India Company]] mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\nCricket never caught on in [[Cricket in Canada|Canada]], despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the game as a way of identifying with the [[British Empire]]. [[History of Canadian cricket|Canada]], unlike Australia and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860\u20131960. Linked to upper class British-Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season it had to compete with [[baseball]]. During the [[First World War]], Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': a Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' (1999) 26#1 pp. 51\u201381</ref><ref>Andrew Horrall, \"'Keep-a-fighting! Play the Game!' Baseball and the Canadian Forces During the First World War,\" ''[[Canadian Military History]]'' (2001) 10#2 pp. 27\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development of the Laws===\n{{See also|Laws of Cricket}}\n\nThe basic rules of cricket such as bat and ball, the wicket, pitch dimensions, overs, how out, etc. have existed since time immemorial. In 1728, the Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] to determine the code of practice in a particular game and this became a common feature, especially around payment of stake money and distributing the winnings given the importance of gambling.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nIn 1744, the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that \"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes\". The codes were drawn up by the so-called \"Star and Garter Club\" whose members ultimately founded [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] at [[Lord's]] in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently.<ref name=MCC>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |title=The official laws of cricket |access-date=30 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203450/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Continued growth in England===\nThe game continued to spread throughout England and, in 1751, [[Yorkshire]] is first mentioned as a venue.<ref name=ASW>[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], \"At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742\u20131751\", ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900</ref> The original form of [[bowling]] (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace.<ref name=LL/> Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772 and since then an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.<ref name=S&B>[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores & Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744\u20131826), Lillywhite, 1862</ref>\n\n[[Image:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An artwork depicting the history of the cricket bat]]\n\nThe first famous clubs were [[London Cricket Club|London]] and [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the [[Artillery Ground]], which still exists. Others followed, particularly [[Slindon Cricket Club|Slindon]] in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]]. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, [[Bromley Cricket Club|Bromley]], [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]], [[Hadlow Cricket Club|Hadlow]] and [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]].\n\nBut far and away the most famous of the early clubs was [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and the opening of [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the first great fast bowler [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]]. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler [[Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens]], who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.\n\nIt was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old \"hockey stick\" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.\n\n===Cricket and crisis===\n[[File:A Game of Cricket (The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|A Game of Cricket at The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park, depiction by unknown artist, c. 1790\u20131799]]\nCricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century when major matches virtually ceased during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game survived and the \"Hambledon Era\" proper began in the mid-1760s.\n\nCricket faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of investment.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |page=4}}</ref> But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery began in 1815.\n\nOn 17 June 1815, on the eve of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] British soldiers played a cricket match in the ''[[Bois de la Cambre]]'' park in Brussels. Ever since the park area where that match took place has been called ''La Pelouse des Anglais'' (the Englishmen's lawn).\n\nMCC was itself the centre of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity between [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] and [[George Osbaldeston]]. In 1817, their intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the top player [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] being banned from playing at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] for life. Gambling scandals in cricket had been going on since the 17th century.\n\nIn the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own making as the campaign to allow [[roundarm bowling]] gathered pace.\n\n==19th century cricket==\n{{main|Overview of English cricket from 1816 to 1863}}\n[[Image:Plainpalais-1817.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Geneva]]'s Plaine de Plainpalais with cricketers, 1817]]\nThe game also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting with [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted to \"player action\" as [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]] created the travelling [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed.\n\n[[Image:Darnall cricket ground.jpg|thumb|right|A cricket match at Darnall, Sheffield in the 1820s.]]\nThe growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 26 (1999): 51\u201381.</ref>\n\nIn 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of [[overarm bowling|overarm]] and in the same year [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] was first published. [[W. G. Grace]] began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.\n\n===International cricket begins===\nThe [[United States v Canada (1844)|first ever international cricket game]] was between the [[United States national cricket team|US]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of the [[St George's Cricket Club]] in New York.<ref name=\"USAvCAN\">{{cite web\n|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/120/120631.html\n|title=United States of America v Canada\n|website=CricketArchive\n|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:England in North America 1859.jpg|thumb|left|The English team 1859 on their way to the US]]\n\nIn 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia. Between May and October 1868, a team of [[Australian Aborigine]]s toured England in what was the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|first Australian cricket team]] to travel overseas.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/collection_interactives/cricketing_journeys/cricket_html/the_australian_eleven/the_australian_eleven_the_first_australian_team The Australian Eleven: The first Australian team], [[National Museum of Australia]]. Retrieved 30 December 2014.</ref>\n\n[[Image:1878AusTeamNiagraFalls.jpg|thumb|The first Australian touring team (1878) pictured at Niagara Falls]]\n\nIn 1877, an [[English cricket team|England]] touring team in [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural [[Test cricket|Test matches]]. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at [[The Oval]] in 1882, the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to [[The Ashes]].\n\n[[South African cricket team|South Africa]] became the third Test nation in 1889.\n\n===National championships===\nA significant development in domestic cricket occurred in 1890 when the official [[County Championship]] was constituted in England. This organisational initiative has been repeated in other countries. Australia established the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 1892\u201393. Other national competitions to be established were the [[Currie Cup (cricket)|Currie Cup]] in South Africa, the [[Plunket Shield]] in New Zealand and the [[Ranji Trophy]] in India.\n\nThe period from 1890 to the outbreak of the First World War has become one of nostalgia, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to \"the spirit of the game\", but more realistically because it was a peacetime period that was shattered by the First World War. The era has been called The [[Golden Age of cricket]] and it featured numerous great names such as Grace, [[Wilfred Rhodes]], [[C. B. Fry]], [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[Victor Trumper]].\n\n===Balls per over===\nCricket started with four balls per over. In 1889 the four balls per over was replaced by a five balls per over and then this was changed to the current six balls per over in 1900. Subsequently, some countries experimented with eight balls per over. In 1922, the number of balls per over was changed from six to eight in Australia only. In 1924 the eight balls per over was extended to New Zealand and in 1937 to South Africa. In England, the eight balls per over was adopted experimentally for the 1939 season; the intention was to continue the experiment in 1940, but first-class cricket was suspended for the Second World War and when it resumed, English cricket reverted to the six ball over. The 1947 ''Laws of Cricket'' allowed six or eight balls depending on the conditions of play. Since the 1979/80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, the six balls per over has been used worldwide and the most recent version of the Laws in 2000 only permits six ball overs.\n\n==20th century cricket==\n===Growth of Test cricket===\n[[Image:Sid Barnes traps Armanath, MCG, February 1948.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sid Barnes]] traps [[Lala Amarnath]] lbw in the first official Test between Australia and India at the MCG in 1948]]\nWhen the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (as it was originally called) was founded in 1909, only England, Australia and South Africa were members. [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] (1928), [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] (1930) and [[India national cricket team|India]] (1932) became Test nations before [[World War II]] and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] (1952) soon afterwards. The international game grew with several ICC Affiliate Members being appointed and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, three of those became full members: [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (1982), [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] (1992) and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] (2000). They were followed in the early 21st century by [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] and [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] (both 2018).\n\nTest cricket remained the sport's highest level of standard throughout the 20th century but it had its problems, notably in the infamous \"[[Bodyline]] Series\" of 1932\u201333 when [[Douglas Jardine]]'s England used so-called \"leg theory\" to try and neutralise the run-scoring brilliance of Australia's [[Don Bradman]].\n\n===Suspension of South Africa (1970\u201391)===\n{{See also|International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981}}\n\nThe greatest crisis to hit international cricket was brought about by [[apartheid]], the South African policy of racial segregation. The situation began to crystallise after 1961 when South Africa left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and so, under the rules of the day, its cricket board had to leave the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC). Cricket's opposition to apartheid intensified in 1968 with the cancellation of England's tour to South Africa by the South African authorities, due to the inclusion of \"coloured\" cricketer [[Basil D'Oliveira]] in the England team. In 1970, the ICC members voted to suspend South Africa indefinitely from international cricket competition.\n\nStarved of top-level competition for its best players, the South African Cricket Board began funding so-called \"rebel tours\", offering large sums of money for international players to form teams and [[South African rebel tours|tour South Africa]]. The ICC's response was to blacklist any rebel players who agreed to tour South Africa, banning them from officially sanctioned international cricket. As players were poorly remunerated during the 1970s, several accepted the offer to tour South Africa, particularly players getting towards the end of their careers for which a blacklisting would have little effect.\n\nThe rebel tours continued into the 1980s but then progress was made in South African politics and it became clear that apartheid was ending. South Africa, now a \"Rainbow Nation\" under [[Nelson Mandela]], was welcomed back into international sport in 1991.\n\n===World Series Cricket===\n{{See also|World Series Cricket}}\n\nThe money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian media magnate [[Kerry Packer]] fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the \"rebel\" players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.\n\n===Limited-overs cricket===\nIn the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship.\n\nAlthough many \"traditional\" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.\n\nThe first limited-overs international match took place at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. [[One Day International|limited-overs internationals]] (LOIs or ODIs\u2014one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first [[Cricket World Cup]] in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.\n\n===Analytic and graphic technology===\nLimited-overs cricket increased television ratings for cricket coverage. Innovative techniques introduced in coverage of limited-over matches were soon adopted for Test coverage. The innovations included presentation of in-depth statistics and graphical analysis, placing miniature cameras in the stumps, multiple usage of cameras to provide shots from several locations around the ground, high-speed photography and computer graphics technology enabling television viewers to study the course of a delivery and help them understand an umpire's decision.\n\nIn 1992, the use of a [[third umpire]] to adjudicate run-out appeals with television replays was introduced in the Test series between South Africa and India. The third umpire's duties have subsequently expanded to include decisions on other aspects of play such as stumpings, catches and boundaries. From 2011, the third umpire was being called upon to moderate [[Umpire Decision Review System|review of umpires' decisions]], including LBW, with the aid of virtual-reality tracking technologies (e.g., [[Hawk-Eye]] and [[Hot Spot (cricket)|Hot Spot]]), though such measures still could not free some disputed decisions from heated controversy.<ref>Gibson, Owen [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/08/cricket-embraced-technology-hawkeye-founder Cricket may have embraced technology too quickly, says Hawk-Eye founder] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 August 2013</ref>\n\n==21st century cricket==\nIn June 2001, the ICC introduced a \"Test Championship Table\" and, in October 2002, a \"One-day International Championship Table\". As indicated by ICC rankings,<ref name=iccrank>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/current/page/211271.html ICC rankings for Tests, ODIs and Twenty20] at espncricinfo.com (Accessed 30 August 2013)</ref> the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]].\n\nThe ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the [[United States cricket team|United States]]. In 2004, the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time. Cricket's newest innovation is [[Twenty20]], essentially an evening entertainment. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience ratings. The [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup]] tournament was held in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/25/content/story/1146856.html|title=Remember these?

There is no official term for cricket of this high standard before 1895 and many loose terms were used for convenience including \"first-class\" itself and other adjectives like \"major\", \"great\" and \"important\", the latter being coined by the ACS for its ''A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863'' (1981).<ref name=\"FMG\">ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', p. 4.</ref> It is generally agreed by the main historical sources that the earliest known example of what was contemporarily called a \"great match\" was the one played for fifty guineas in June 1697 between two eleven-a-side teams at an unspecified location in Sussex.<ref name=\"TJM\"/> It is entirely feasible, and is indeed believed by some historians, that major matches were played for many years before 1697.<ref name=\"W10\">Webber, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"A23\">Altham, p. 23.</ref> In 1695, the English Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act's expiry in 1696.<ref name=\"L95\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1695 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref> The main reason for matches before 1697 being unknown is that, while the Licensing Act was in force, it effectively imposed censorship upon the press and sport was not deemed to be a suitable subject for newspaper coverage. After the restrictions were removed, sport was gradually introduced into the newspapers but it would be decades before coverage became anything substantial, let alone comprehensive.<ref name=\"L95\"/>\n\nFrom 1895, there is no question about first-class status because of the official definition.<ref name=\"FMG\"/> The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined by the ICC, although there has been hardly any controversy about match status outside Great Britain before 1947.<ref name=WCA48>''Wisden 1948'', p. 813.</ref> Status of [[limited overs cricket|limited overs matches]], which began in 1963, is governed by the official [[List A]] categorisation and there are similarly no issues about major [[Twenty20]] matches. Although the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been exceptions although these account for a tiny percentage of the total number of matches recorded. Apart from [[Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram's XI cricket team in India and Ceylon in 1930\u201331|one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930\u201331]], all the \"disputed\" matches took place in England before 1895: see [[Variations in published cricket statistics]] for further information.\n\nThe list below is by no means exhaustive, but the works included are widely held in cricketing circles to be significant and substantial sources of information about the development of the sport from the end of the 17th century to the commencement of officially defined first-class cricket in 1895. These are widely used to determine the status of individual matches, teams, venues and players. In a more general sense, all of the sources listed in [[Bibliography of cricket]], though again this is not an exhaustive list, are reliable but autobiographies and other works with a narrow scope are not necessarily suitable, certainly not if used in isolation, to determine match status.\n\n===Books and other printed works===\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 \u2013 1863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.

Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 and [[Test cricket]] began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after [[association football]] (soccer). Governance is by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.\n\n==Early cricket==\n{{main|History of cricket to 1725}}{{Cricket sidebar |expanded=all}}\n\n===Origin===\nCricket was probably created during [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] or [[Normans|Norman]] times by children living in the [[Weald]], an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].<ref name=\"PWT\">{{cite book |last=Wynne-Thomas |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Wynne-Thomas |title=From the Weald to the World |year=1997 |publisher=Stationery Office Books}}</ref> The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\"]] Julian date, the year equating to 1598 in the modern calendar).\n\nThere have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 1300 and concerns the future [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] playing at \"creag and other games\" in both [[Westminster]] and [[Newenden]]. It has been suggested that \"creag\" was an [[Early Modern English|Olde English]] word for cricket but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of \"[[craic]]\", meaning \"fun and games in general\".<ref name=\"HSA\">{{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.S. |authorlink=H.

Possibly cricket was derived from [[bowls]], assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a [[wicket gate]]) as the wicket.<ref name=\"DB\">{{cite book |last=Birley |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Birley |title=A Social History of English Cricket |year=1999 |publisher=Aurum}}</ref>\n\n===First definite reference===\n[[Image:RGS old building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|John Derrick was a pupil at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]], then the Free School, in Guildford when he and his friends played ''creckett'' circa 1550]]  \n \nA 1597 (Old Style \u2013 1598 New Style) court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] mentions the game of ''creckett''. A 59-year-old coroner, [[John Derrick]], testified that he and his school friends had played ''creckett'' on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Free School]]. Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey ''circa'' 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.<ref name=\"HSA21\">Altham, p. 21.</ref><ref>Underdown, p. 3.</ref>\n\nThe first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.<ref name=\"TJM\">McCann, p. xxxi.</ref> In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Derivation of the name of \"cricket\"===\nA number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference,it was spelled ''creckett''. The name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''krick''(''-e''), meaning a stick; or the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff, or the [[French language|French]] word ''criquet'' meaning a wooden post.<ref name=\"DB\"/> The Middle Dutch word ''krickstoel'' means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.<ref>Bowen, p. 33.</ref> According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the [[University of Bonn]], \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for [[hockey]], ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").<ref name=\"Terry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |title=The Seventeenth Century Game of Cricket: A Reconstruction of the Game |last=Terry |first=David |publisher=SportsLibrary |date=2008 |accessdate=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621011709/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |archivedate=21 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the [[County of Flanders]], especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], many Middle Dutch<ref>Middle Dutch was the language in use in Flanders at the time.</ref> words found their way into southern English dialects.<ref name=RB>[[Rowland Bowen]], ''Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development'', Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1970</ref>\n\n===Early 17th century===\nA number of references occur up to the [[English Civil War]] and these indicate that cricket had become an adult game contested by parish teams, but there is no evidence of county strength teams at this time. Equally, there is little evidence of the rampant gambling that characterised the game throughout the 18th century. It is generally believed, therefore, that [[village cricket]] had developed by the middle of the 17th century but that county cricket had not and that investment in the game had not begun.<ref name=LL>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html ''From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300\u20131787'']</ref>\n\n===The Commonwealth===\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government clamped down on \"unlawful assemblies\", in particular the more raucous sports such as football. Their laws also demanded a stricter observance of the Sabbath than there had been previously. As the Sabbath was the only free time available to the lower classes, cricket's popularity may have waned during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]]. There is no actual evidence that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s regime banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the [[interregnum]] that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did not cause any \"breach of the Sabbath\".<ref name=LL/> It is believed that the nobility in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village games.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Gambling and press coverage===\nCricket certainly thrived after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the \"Cavalier\" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to \u00a3100, although that was still a fortune at the time,<ref name=LL/> equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|100|1664|r=-3}}}} in present-day terms {{inflation-fn|UK}}. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a \"great match\" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] a side.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nWith [[freedom of the press]] having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.<ref name=LL/>\n\n==18th century cricket==\n{{See also|History of cricket to 1725|History of cricket (1726\u201340)}}\n\n===Patronage and players===\nGambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first \"county teams\" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing \"local experts\" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/> The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.\n\nThe most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|the 2nd Duke of Richmond]], [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]], [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]] and [[Edwin Stead]]. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like [[Thomas Waymark]].\n\n===Cricket expands beyond England===\nCricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century,<ref name=RB/> probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the [[West Indies]] by colonists<ref name=RB/> and to India by [[British East India Company]] mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\nCricket never caught on in [[Cricket in Canada|Canada]], despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the game as a way of identifying with the [[British Empire]]. [[History of Canadian cricket|Canada]], unlike Australia and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860\u20131960. Linked to upper class British-Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season it had to compete with [[baseball]]. During the [[First World War]], Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': a Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' (1999) 26#1 pp. 51\u201381</ref><ref>Andrew Horrall, \"'Keep-a-fighting! Play the Game!' Baseball and the Canadian Forces During the First World War,\" ''[[Canadian Military History]]'' (2001) 10#2 pp. 27\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development of the Laws===\n{{See also|Laws of Cricket}}\n\nThe basic rules of cricket such as bat and ball, the wicket, pitch dimensions, overs, how out, etc. have existed since time immemorial. In 1728, the Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] to determine the code of practice in a particular game and this became a common feature, especially around payment of stake money and distributing the winnings given the importance of gambling.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nIn 1744, the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that \"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes\". The codes were drawn up by the so-called \"Star and Garter Club\" whose members ultimately founded [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] at [[Lord's]] in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently.<ref name=MCC>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |title=The official laws of cricket |access-date=30 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203450/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Continued growth in England===\nThe game continued to spread throughout England and, in 1751, [[Yorkshire]] is first mentioned as a venue.<ref name=ASW>[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], \"At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742\u20131751\", ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900</ref> The original form of [[bowling]] (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace.<ref name=LL/> Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772 and since then an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.<ref name=S&B>[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores & Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744\u20131826), Lillywhite, 1862</ref>\n\n[[Image:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An artwork depicting the history of the cricket bat]]\n\nThe first famous clubs were [[London Cricket Club|London]] and [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the [[Artillery Ground]], which still exists. Others followed, particularly [[Slindon Cricket Club|Slindon]] in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]]. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, [[Bromley Cricket Club|Bromley]], [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]], [[Hadlow Cricket Club|Hadlow]] and [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]].\n\nBut far and away the most famous of the early clubs was [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and the opening of [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the first great fast bowler [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]]. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler [[Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens]], who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.\n\nIt was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old \"hockey stick\" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.\n\n===Cricket and crisis===\n[[File:A Game of Cricket (The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|A Game of Cricket at The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park, depiction by unknown artist, c. 1790\u20131799]]\nCricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century when major matches virtually ceased during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game survived and the \"Hambledon Era\" proper began in the mid-1760s.\n\nCricket faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of investment.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |page=4}}</ref> But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery began in 1815.\n\nOn 17 June 1815, on the eve of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] British soldiers played a cricket match in the ''[[Bois de la Cambre]]'' park in Brussels. Ever since the park area where that match took place has been called ''La Pelouse des Anglais'' (the Englishmen's lawn).\n\nMCC was itself the centre of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity between [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] and [[George Osbaldeston]]. In 1817, their intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the top player [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] being banned from playing at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] for life. Gambling scandals in cricket had been going on since the 17th century.\n\nIn the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own making as the campaign to allow [[roundarm bowling]] gathered pace.\n\n==19th century cricket==\n{{main|Overview of English cricket from 1816 to 1863}}\n[[Image:Plainpalais-1817.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Geneva]]'s Plaine de Plainpalais with cricketers, 1817]]\nThe game also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting with [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted to \"player action\" as [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]] created the travelling [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed.\n\n[[Image:Darnall cricket ground.jpg|thumb|right|A cricket match at Darnall, Sheffield in the 1820s.]]\nThe growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 26 (1999): 51\u201381.</ref>\n\nIn 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of [[overarm bowling|overarm]] and in the same year [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] was first published. [[W. G. Grace]] began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.\n\n===International cricket begins===\nThe [[United States v Canada (1844)|first ever international cricket game]] was between the [[United States national cricket team|US]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of the [[St George's Cricket Club]] in New York.<ref name=\"USAvCAN\">{{cite web\n|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/120/120631.html\n|title=United States of America v Canada\n|website=CricketArchive\n|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:England in North America 1859.jpg|thumb|left|The English team 1859 on their way to the US]]\n\nIn 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia. Between May and October 1868, a team of [[Australian Aborigine]]s toured England in what was the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|first Australian cricket team]] to travel overseas.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/collection_interactives/cricketing_journeys/cricket_html/the_australian_eleven/the_australian_eleven_the_first_australian_team The Australian Eleven: The first Australian team], [[National Museum of Australia]]. Retrieved 30 December 2014.</ref>\n\n[[Image:1878AusTeamNiagraFalls.jpg|thumb|The first Australian touring team (1878) pictured at Niagara Falls]]\n\nIn 1877, an [[English cricket team|England]] touring team in [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural [[Test cricket|Test matches]]. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at [[The Oval]] in 1882, the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to [[The Ashes]].\n\n[[South African cricket team|South Africa]] became the third Test nation in 1889.\n\n===National championships===\nA significant development in domestic cricket occurred in 1890 when the official [[County Championship]] was constituted in England. This organisational initiative has been repeated in other countries. Australia established the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 1892\u201393. Other national competitions to be established were the [[Currie Cup (cricket)|Currie Cup]] in South Africa, the [[Plunket Shield]] in New Zealand and the [[Ranji Trophy]] in India.\n\nThe period from 1890 to the outbreak of the First World War has become one of nostalgia, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to \"the spirit of the game\", but more realistically because it was a peacetime period that was shattered by the First World War. The era has been called The [[Golden Age of cricket]] and it featured numerous great names such as Grace, [[Wilfred Rhodes]], [[C. B. Fry]], [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[Victor Trumper]].\n\n===Balls per over===\nCricket started with four balls per over. In 1889 the four balls per over was replaced by a five balls per over and then this was changed to the current six balls per over in 1900. Subsequently, some countries experimented with eight balls per over. In 1922, the number of balls per over was changed from six to eight in Australia only. In 1924 the eight balls per over was extended to New Zealand and in 1937 to South Africa. In England, the eight balls per over was adopted experimentally for the 1939 season; the intention was to continue the experiment in 1940, but first-class cricket was suspended for the Second World War and when it resumed, English cricket reverted to the six ball over. The 1947 ''Laws of Cricket'' allowed six or eight balls depending on the conditions of play. Since the 1979/80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, the six balls per over has been used worldwide and the most recent version of the Laws in 2000 only permits six ball overs.\n\n==20th century cricket==\n===Growth of Test cricket===\n[[Image:Sid Barnes traps Armanath, MCG, February 1948.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sid Barnes]] traps [[Lala Amarnath]] lbw in the first official Test between Australia and India at the MCG in 1948]]\nWhen the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (as it was originally called) was founded in 1909, only England, Australia and South Africa were members. [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] (1928), [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] (1930) and [[India national cricket team|India]] (1932) became Test nations before [[World War II]] and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] (1952) soon afterwards. The international game grew with several ICC Affiliate Members being appointed and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, three of those became full members: [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (1982), [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] (1992) and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] (2000). They were followed in the early 21st century by [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] and [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] (both 2018).\n\nTest cricket remained the sport's highest level of standard throughout the 20th century but it had its problems, notably in the infamous \"[[Bodyline]] Series\" of 1932\u201333 when [[Douglas Jardine]]'s England used so-called \"leg theory\" to try and neutralise the run-scoring brilliance of Australia's [[Don Bradman]].\n\n===Suspension of South Africa (1970\u201391)===\n{{See also|International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981}}\n\nThe greatest crisis to hit international cricket was brought about by [[apartheid]], the South African policy of racial segregation. The situation began to crystallise after 1961 when South Africa left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and so, under the rules of the day, its cricket board had to leave the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC). Cricket's opposition to apartheid intensified in 1968 with the cancellation of England's tour to South Africa by the South African authorities, due to the inclusion of \"coloured\" cricketer [[Basil D'Oliveira]] in the England team. In 1970, the ICC members voted to suspend South Africa indefinitely from international cricket competition.\n\nStarved of top-level competition for its best players, the South African Cricket Board began funding so-called \"rebel tours\", offering large sums of money for international players to form teams and [[South African rebel tours|tour South Africa]]. The ICC's response was to blacklist any rebel players who agreed to tour South Africa, banning them from officially sanctioned international cricket. As players were poorly remunerated during the 1970s, several accepted the offer to tour South Africa, particularly players getting towards the end of their careers for which a blacklisting would have little effect.\n\nThe rebel tours continued into the 1980s but then progress was made in South African politics and it became clear that apartheid was ending. South Africa, now a \"Rainbow Nation\" under [[Nelson Mandela]], was welcomed back into international sport in 1991.\n\n===World Series Cricket===\n{{See also|World Series Cricket}}\n\nThe money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian media magnate [[Kerry Packer]] fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the \"rebel\" players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.\n\n===Limited-overs cricket===\nIn the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship.\n\nAlthough many \"traditional\" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.\n\nThe first limited-overs international match took place at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. [[One Day International|limited-overs internationals]] (LOIs or ODIs\u2014one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first [[Cricket World Cup]] in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.\n\n===Analytic and graphic technology===\nLimited-overs cricket increased television ratings for cricket coverage. Innovative techniques introduced in coverage of limited-over matches were soon adopted for Test coverage. The innovations included presentation of in-depth statistics and graphical analysis, placing miniature cameras in the stumps, multiple usage of cameras to provide shots from several locations around the ground, high-speed photography and computer graphics technology enabling television viewers to study the course of a delivery and help them understand an umpire's decision.\n\nIn 1992, the use of a [[third umpire]] to adjudicate run-out appeals with television replays was introduced in the Test series between South Africa and India. The third umpire's duties have subsequently expanded to include decisions on other aspects of play such as stumpings, catches and boundaries. From 2011, the third umpire was being called upon to moderate [[Umpire Decision Review System|review of umpires' decisions]], including LBW, with the aid of virtual-reality tracking technologies (e.g., [[Hawk-Eye]] and [[Hot Spot (cricket)|Hot Spot]]), though such measures still could not free some disputed decisions from heated controversy.<ref>Gibson, Owen [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/08/cricket-embraced-technology-hawkeye-founder Cricket may have embraced technology too quickly, says Hawk-Eye founder] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 August 2013</ref>\n\n==21st century cricket==\nIn June 2001, the ICC introduced a \"Test Championship Table\" and, in October 2002, a \"One-day International Championship Table\". As indicated by ICC rankings,<ref name=iccrank>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/current/page/211271.html ICC rankings for Tests, ODIs and Twenty20] at espncricinfo.com (Accessed 30 August 2013)</ref> the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]].\n\nThe ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the [[United States cricket team|United States]]. In 2004, the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time. Cricket's newest innovation is [[Twenty20]], essentially an evening entertainment. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience ratings. The [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup]] tournament was held in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/25/content/story/1146856.html|title=Remember these?

There is no official term for cricket of this high standard before 1895 and many loose terms were used for convenience including \"first-class\" itself and other adjectives like \"major\", \"great\" and \"important\", the latter being coined by the ACS for its ''A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863'' (1981).<ref name=\"FMG\">ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', p. 4.</ref> It is generally agreed by the main historical sources that the earliest known example of what was contemporarily called a \"great match\" was the one played for fifty guineas in June 1697 between two eleven-a-side teams at an unspecified location in Sussex.<ref name=\"TJM\"/> It is entirely feasible, and is indeed believed by some historians, that major matches were played for many years before 1697.<ref name=\"W10\">Webber, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"A23\">Altham, p. 23.</ref> In 1695, the English Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act's expiry in 1696.<ref name=\"L95\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1695 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref> The main reason for matches before 1697 being unknown is that, while the Licensing Act was in force, it effectively imposed censorship upon the press and sport was not deemed to be a suitable subject for newspaper coverage.

Apart from [[Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram's XI cricket team in India and Ceylon in 1930\u201331|one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930\u201331]], all the \"disputed\" matches took place in England before 1895: see [[Variations in published cricket statistics]] for further information.\n\nThe list below is by no means exhaustive, but the works included are widely held in cricketing circles to be significant and substantial sources of information about the development of the sport from the end of the 17th century to the commencement of officially defined first-class cricket in 1895. These are widely used to determine the status of individual matches, teams, venues and players. In a more general sense, all of the sources listed in [[Bibliography of cricket]], though again this is not an exhaustive list, are reliable but autobiographies and other works with a narrow scope are not necessarily suitable, certainly not if used in isolation, to determine match status.\n\n===Books and other printed works===\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 \u2013 1863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.

It encompasses a broad range of ideas and sentiments harbored by the [[Japanese people]] over the last two centuries regarding their native country, its cultural nature, political form and historical destiny. It is useful to distinguish Japanese [[cultural nationalism]] (see also [[nihonjinron]]) from political or state-directed nationalism (i.e., [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Sh\u014dwa statism]]), since many forms of cultural nationalism, such as those associated with [[Japanese folklore|folkloric studies]] (i.e., [[Yanagita Kunio]]), have been hostile to state-fostered nationalism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn [[Meiji period]] Japan, nationalist ideology consisted of a blend of native and imported [[political philosophies]], initially developed by the [[Meiji government]] to promote national unity and [[patriotism]], first in defense against [[colonization]] by Western powers, and later in a struggle to attain equality with the [[Great power|Great Powers]]. It evolved throughout the [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d]] and [[Sh\u014dwa period]]s to justify an increasingly [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government and [[Japanese expansionism|overseas expansionism]], and provided a political and ideological foundation for the actions of the Japanese military in the years leading up to [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Meiji period beginnings 1868\u20131912==\nDuring the final days of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the perceived threat of foreign encroachment, especially after the arrival of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] and the signing of the [[Kanagawa Accord]], led to increased prominence to the development of nationalist ideologies. Some prominent ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' promoted the concept of ''fukko'' (a return to the past), while others promoted ''\u014dsei'' (the Emperor's supreme authority). The terms were not mutually exclusive, merging into the ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians) concept, which in turn was a major driving force in starting the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe [[Meiji Constitution]] of 1889 defined allegiance to the State as the citizen's highest duty. While the constitution itself contained a mix of political Western practices and traditional Japanese political ideas, government philosophy increasingly centered on promoting [[social harmony]] and a sense of the [[nihonjinron|uniqueness of the Japanese people]] ''([[kokutai]])''.\n\n===Basis of economic growth===\nThe extreme disparity in economic and military power between Japan and the Western colonial powers was a great cause for concern for the early [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leadership]]. The motto ''[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei]]'' (enrich the country and strengthen the military) symbolized Meiji period nationalistic policies to provide government support to strengthen strategic industries. Only with a strong economic base could Japan afford to build a strong, modern military along Western lines, and only with a strong economy and military could Japan force a [[Unequal Treaties|revision of the unequal treaties]], such as the Kanagawa Accords. Government policies also laid the basis of later industrialist empires known as the ''[[zaibatsu]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=needs citation and neutral editing|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''Bushido'' (\u6b66\u58eb\u9053)===\nAs a residue of its widespread use in propaganda during the 19th century, military nationalism in Japan was often known as ''[[bushid\u014d]]'' (the way of the Samurai). The word, denoting a coherent code of beliefs and doctrines about the proper path of the [[samurai]], or what is called generically 'warrior thought' (\u6b66\u5bb6\u601d\u60f3, ''buke shis\u014d''), is rarely encountered in Japanese texts before the Meiji era, when the 11 volumes of the ''[[Hagakure]]'' of [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], compiled in the years from 1710 to 1716 where the character combination is employed, was finally published.\n\nConstituted over a long time by house manuals on war and warriorship, it gained some official backing with the establishment of the [[Bakufu]], which sought an ideological orthodoxy in the [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Zhu Xi]] tailored for military echelons that formed the basis of the new shogunal government.<ref>Grant K. Goodman, ''Japan and the Dutch 1600-1853'', Curzon Press, 2000, pp.1-8</ref> An important early role was played by [[Yamaga Sok\u014d]] in theorizing a Japanese military ethos. After the abolition of the feudal system, the new military institutions of Japan were shaped along European lines, with Western instructors, and the codes themselves modeled on standard models adapted from abroad. The impeccable behaviour, in terms of international criteria, displayed by the Japanese military in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] was proof that Japan finally had a modern army whose techniques, drilling and etiquette of war differed little from that of what prevailed among the Western imperial powers.{{Citation needed|reason=needs citation and neutral editing|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe ''[[Imperial Rescript for Seamen and Soldiers]]'' (1890), presented Japan as a \"sacred nation protected by the gods\". An undercurrent of traditional warrior values never wholly disappeared, and as Japan slid towards a cycle of repeated crises from the mid-Taish\u014d to early Sh\u014dwa eras, the old samurai ideals began to assume importance among more politicized officers in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. [[Sadao Araki]] played an important role in adapting a doctrine of ''[[seishin ky\u014diku]]'' (spiritual training) as an ideological backbone for army personnel. As [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Minister of Education]], he supported the integration of the samurai code into the national education system.\n\n===Role of ''Shinto''===\n{{Main|State Shinto}}\n\nIn developing the modern concepts of {{nihongo|[[State Shinto]]ism|\u56fd\u5bb6\u795e\u9053|kokka shint\u014d}} and [[emperor worship]], various Japanese philosophers tried to revive or purify national beliefs (''[[kokugaku]]'') by removing imported foreign ideas, borrowed primarily from [[Chinese philosophy]]. This \"Restoration Shint\u014dist Movement\" began with [[Motoori Norinaga]] in the 18th century. Motoori Norinaga, and later [[Hirata Atsutane]], based their research on the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and other classic Shint\u014d texts which teach the superiority of the Sun Goddess ''[[Amaterasu]]''. This formed the basis for State Shint\u014dism, as the [[Imperial Family of Japan|Japanese emperor]] claimed direct descent from ''Amaterasu''. The emperor himself was therefore sacred, and all proclamations of the emperor had thus a religious significance.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, the new imperial government needed to rapidly modernize the polity and [[economy of Japan]], and the Meiji oligarchy felt that those goals could only be accomplished through a strong sense of national unity and cultural identity, with State Shint\u014dism as an essential counterweight to the imported [[Buddhism]] of the past, the [[Christianity]] and other Western philosophies of the present.{{Citation needed|reason=needs citation and neutral editing|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1890, the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to \"offer yourselves courageously to the State\" as well as protect the Imperial family. The practice of emperor worship was further spread by distributing imperial portraits for esoteric veneration. All of these practices used to fortify national solidarity through patriotic centralized observance at shrines are said to have given pre-war Japanese nationalism a tint of [[mysticism]] and cultural introversion.<ref>Hall, Japan From Prehistory to Modern Times, page 328</ref>\n\nThe {{nihongo|''[[hakko ichiu]]''|\u516b\u7d18\u4e00\u5b87}} philosophy became popular during the Second Sino-Japanese War. This came to be regarded by [[Japanese militarism|militarists]] as a doctrine that the emperor was the center of the phenomenal world, lending religious impetus to ideas of Japanese territorial expansion.\n\n===Education===\n{{Main|Education in the Empire of Japan}}\n\nThe principal educational emphasis from the Meiji period was on the great importance of traditional national political values, religion and morality. The Imperial Rescript on Education of 1890 promoted a return to traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] in the hierarchal nature of human relations, with the State superior to the Individual, and the Emperor superior to the State. The Japanese state modernized organizationally, but preserved its national idiosyncrasies. The attitude reinforced from 1905 was that Japan was to be a powerful nation, equal at least to the Western powers. During the Sh\u014dwa period the educational system was used for supporting the militarized state and preparing future soldiers.\n\nThe government published official text books for all levels of student, and reinforced that with cultural activities, seminars, etc. Emphasis on the texts such as the ''Kokutai-no-shugi'' in schools was intended to emphasize the \"uniqueness of Japan\" from ancient centuries. These cultural courses were supplemented with military and survival courses against foreign invasion.\n\nApart from indoctrination in nationalism and religion, children and school students received military drills (survival, [[first aid]]). These were taken further by the [[Imperial Youth Federation]]; college students were trained, and some recruited, for home defense and regular military units. Young women received first aid training. All of these actions were said to be taken to ensure Japan's safety, and protect against larger and more dangerous countries.\n\n==Nationalist politics==\n\n===Origin of nationalist structures and parties===\n{{Main|Empire of Japan}}\n\nIn 1882, the Japanese Government organized the [[Teiseito]] (Imperial Gubernative Party), one of the first nationalist parties in the country. Starting from the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Japan adopted the moniker \"[[Empire of Japan|Dai Nippon Teikoku]]\", acquiring a colonial empire, with the acquisition of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyus]] (1879), [[Taiwan|Formosa]] (1895), the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Karafuto Prefecture|Karafuto]] (1905), the [[South Pacific Mandate]] islands (1918\u201319) and [[Korea|Joseon]] (Korea) (1905\u201310).\n\nThe wars against China and Russia were modern wars, and demanded a nationalist expression of patriotic sentiment. From this period, the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] (founded in 1869) was converted into a focus for nationalist sentiment, and received state patronage until the end of World War II. Yasukuni was dedicated to those Japanese and non-Japanese who had lost their lives serving Japan, and includes all war deaths from domestic and overseas conflicts from 1869\u20131945 (and none from any conflicts since 1945), but also civilians (women and students) and civil administration in colonies and occupied territories.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1928, the central government organized the \"Peace Preservation Department\" (an antisubversive police section), and prosecuted all local [[Communism|communist]]s who proposed a [[Socialism|socialist]] form of government. The Japanese Army organized the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' (military police service). Dissent was controlled by the usage of political and [[Censorship in the Empire of Japan|press repression]], with the [[Peace Preservation Law]] permitting police to restrict freedom of expression and freedom to assemble.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1935, the Nippon Shimbun (\u65e5\u672c\u65b0\u805e) promoted nationalist ideology and sought to influence the Japanese political landscape.  In spite of a relatively small overall circulation, it had wide readership among right-wing politicians and advocated the concept of the divine right of the emperor by vigorously attacking [[Tatsukichi Minobe]]'s \u201cemperor organ theory\u201d.<ref name=nhk>{{cite web | title=\u6226\u524d\u6700\u5927\u306e\u53f3\u6d3e\u65b0\u805e\u7d0410\u5e74\u5206\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308b|url=https://www.nhk.or.jp/politics/articles/lastweek/21287.html| publisher=[[NHK]]|date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name=nhk2>{{cite web | title=The Fall of Freedom - How a newspaper led Japan to war|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/documentary/20191013/4001341/| publisher=[[NHK]]|date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Realities of political power===\n[[File:Naval ensign of the Empire of Japan.svg|thumb|[[Kyokujitsu-ki]] (the sun-with rays-flag) It was the [[ensign]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]; and is now employed by [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] Ships]]\n[[File:Rising sun flag.JPG|thumb|[[Naval ensign]] of the battleship [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']]]]\nSince the Meiji restoration, the central figure of the state was the [[emperor]]. According to the constitution, the emperor was [[Head of State]] (article 4) and Supreme Commander of the Army and the Navy (article 11). [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] was also, from 1937, the commander of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]]. Japanese citizens were rallied to the \"Defensive State\" or \"Consensus State\", in which all efforts of the nation supported collective objectives, by guidance from [[national myths]], history, and dogma \u2014 thus obtaining a \"national consensus\". Democratic institutions were installed in 1890 with the promulgation of a constitution and continued to acquire legitimacy until the 1920s, when they fell into disrepute.\n\nConcerns that irresponsible political parties could have too great an influence over vital military affairs introduced a rule that the Army alone should nominate the Army Minister in civilian government. This permitted the army to have a ''[[de facto]]'' [[veto]] over civilian governments by having the power to refuse to nominate a candidate. This policy was introduced in law in 1900 but abolished in 1913. It was reintroduced in 1936, cementing military influence over government after that time.\n\nThe political system of Japan became subverted by the military throughout the 1930s from repeated attempted coups, and independent militarist interventions. The invasion of Manchuria after elements in the army manufactured an incident to justify a takeover was accomplished without instruction from the Tokyo government. This showed the impotence of the civilian government to have any influence over the impulses of the army. Governments become increasingly passive, allowing agency and direction of the state to fall to disparate competing elements of the army. The role of the emperor remained highly prestigious, with various factions competing to advocate their interpretation of what the emperor \"truly\" wanted.\n\nAfter the war, scrutiny of the emperor's role in the war and militarism intensified. For many historians such as [[Akira Fujiwara]], Akira Yamada, Peter Wetzler, [[Herbert Bix]] and [[John W. Dower|John Dower]], the work done by [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] during the first months of the [[occupation of Japan]] to exonerate Hirohito and all the imperial family from criminal prosecutions in the [[Tokyo tribunal]] was the predominant factor in the campaign to diminish in retrospect the role played by the emperor during the war. They argue that post-war view focused on the imperial conferences and missed the numerous \"behind the chrysanthemum curtain\" meetings where the real decisions were made between [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]], his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. For Fujiwara, \"the thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision, is a myth fabricated after the war.\"<ref>''Sh\u014dwa tenn\u014d no 15 nen sens\u014d'' ''(The Sh\u014dwa emperor fifteen years war)'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref>\n\n===Political ideas===\nDuring the 1920s, right-wing nationalist beliefs became an increasingly dominant force. State support for Shinto encouraged a belief in the mythological history of Japan and thus led to mysticism and cultural chauvinism. Some secret societies took up [[nationalism#ultranationalism|ultranationalism]] and Japan-centered radical ideas. They included: ''[[Geny\u014dsha]]'' (Black Ocean Society, 1881), ''[[Kokuryu-kai]]'' (Amur River Society, or Black Dragon Society, 1901), movements dedicated to overseas Japanese expansion to the north; ''[[Nihon Kokusui Kai]]'' (Japanese Patriotic Society, 1919), founded by [[Tokoname Takejiro]]; ''[[Sekka Boshidan]]'' (Anti-Red League) founded at the same time as the [[Japanese Communist Party]]; and the ''[[Kokuhonsha]]'' (State Basis Society) founded in 1924 by [[Baron Hiranuma]], for the preservation of the unique national character of Japan and its special mission in Asia.\n\nSome of the nationalist ideas can be attributed to the ideologue [[Ikki Kita]] (1885\u20131937), an Amur River Society member. In his 1919 book ''An Outline Plan for the Reorganization of Japan'', Kita proposed a military ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' to promote the supposed true aims of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. This book was banned, but certain military circles read in it in the early 1930s. Kita's plan was phrased in terms of freeing the Emperor from weak or treasonous counsellors. After suspending the constitution, and dissolving the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], the Emperor and his military defenders should work for a \"collectivist direct voluntarism\" to unify people and leaders. Harmony with the [[working class]]es would be sought by the abolition of the aristocracy and austerity for the Imperial House. Overseas, Japan would [[Anti-Western sentiment|free]] Asia of Western influence. The Amur River Society was later instrumental in the Manchurian incident.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Political nationalist movements===\nThe Japanese Navy was in general terms more traditionalist, in defending ancient values and the sacred nature of the Emperor; the Japanese Army was more forward-looking, in the sense of valuing primarily strong leadership, as is evidenced by the use of the ''coup'' and direct action. The Navy typically preferred political methods. The Army, ultimately, was the vehicle for the hypernationalists, anti-communists, anticapitalists, antiparliamentarians, and Nationalist-Militarist ideals.\n\nThe military were considered politically \"clean\" in terms of [[political corruption]], additionally assuming responsibility for 'restoring' the security of the nation. The armed forces took up criticism of the traditional democratic parties and regular government for many reasons (low funds for the armed forces, compromised national security, weakness of the leaders). They were also, by their composition, closely aware of the effects of economic depression on the middle and lower classes, and the [[communist]] threat.\n\nBoth branches gained in power as they administered the exterior provinces and military preparations. k kid\n\n===Nationalist right in the 1920s===\nOther nationalist rightist groups in the 1920s were the ''Jinmu Kai'' ([[Emperor Jimmu]] Society), ''Tenketo Kai'' (Heaven Spade Party), ''Ketsumeidan'' (Blood Fraternity) and ''[[Sakura Kai]]'' (Cherry Blossom Society) . This last was founded by Dr. [[Sh\u016bmei \u014ckawa]], professor of the Colonization Academy, and radical defender of expansionism and military armed revolution at home. Amongst members were Army officers implicated in the Manchuria Affair, such as [[Kingoro Hashimoto]], and [[Ishikawa Kanishi]]. Okawa served as a conduit by which [[Kita Ikki]]'s ideas reached young nationalist officers on the right.\n\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and Nobusuke Kishi in 1943.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] (right) and [[Nobusuke Kishi]], October 1943]]\nViolent ''coups'' took place, and the [[Kwantung Army]] made, in effect unilaterally, the decision to invade Manchuria. This was then treated as a ''fait accompli'' by Government and Emperor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Doctrines===\nThe [[Amau Doctrine]] (the \"Asian [[Monroe Doctrine]]\") stated that Japan assumed the total responsibility for peace in Asia. Minister [[K\u014dki Hirota]] proclaimed \"a special zone, anti-communist, pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo\" and that Northern China was a \"fundamental part\" of Japanese national existence, in announcing a \"holy war\" against the Soviet Union and China as the \"national mission\".\n\nDuring 1940 [[Prince Konoe]] proclaimed the ''Shintaisei'' (New National Structure), making Japan into an \"advanced state of National Defense\", and the creation of the ''[[Taisei Yokusankai]]'' (Imperial Authority Assistance Association), for organizing a centralized \"consensus state\". Associated are the government creation of the ''[[Tonarigumi]]'' (residents' committees). Other ideological creations of the time were the book \"[[Shinmin no Michi]]\" (\u81e3\u6c11\u306e\u9053), the \"Imperial Way\" or \"War Party\" (''[[Kodoha]]'') Army party, the \"Yamato spirit\" (''[[Yamato-damashii]]''), and the idea of ''[[hakko ichiu]]'' (which directly translates to \"8 corners under one roof\", that means, \"one house in which every people can live\" or \"everyone is family\"), \"Religion and Government Unity\" (''Saisei itchi''), and ''Kokka Sodoin Ho'' (General Mobilization Right).\n\nThe official academic texts included ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]]'' and ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]''. Both presented a view of Japan's history and the Japanese ideal to unite East and West.\n\n===Geostrategy===\n{{Main|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\n[[File:Japanese Empire - 1942.svg|thumb|[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] at its greatest extent]]\nThe economic doctrines of the \"[[Yen block]]\" were in 1941 transformed to the \"Great Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" Plan, as a basis for the Japanese national finances, and conquest plans. There was a history of perhaps two decades behind these moves.\n\nThe [[Japanese Geopolitics prewar and wartimes (WW2)|Japanese theorists]], such as [[Saneshige Komaki]], concerned with Mainland Asia, knew the [[geostrategy|geostrategic]] theory of [[Halford Mackinder]], expressed in the book ''Democratic Ideas and Reality''. He discussed why the 'World Island' of Eurasia and Africa was dominant, and why the key to this was the 'Central Land' in [[Central Asia]]. This is protected from sea attack, by deserts and mountains, and is vulnerable only on its west side, and to advanced technology from Europe.\n\nMackinder declared that: \"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World\". These central Asiatic lands included: all of the Soviet Union, except the Pacific coast, west of the [[Volga river]]; all [[Mongolia]], [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]], [[Tibet]] and [[Iran]]. This zone is vast and possesses natural resources and raw materials, does not possess major farming possibilities, and has very little population. Mackinder thought in terms of land and sea power: the latter can outflank the former, and carry out distant [[logistical]] operations, but needs adequate bases.\n\nThese geopolitical ideas coincided with the theories of Lieutenant Colonel [[Kanji Ishiwara]], sent in 1928 to Manchuria to spy. The Army adopted them, in the form of the [[Hokushin-ron|Strike North Group]]. The Navy, on the other hand, was interested in the [[Nanshin-ron|southerly direction]] of expansion. An extended debate ensued, resolved in the end by the stern experience of Japan's armed conflicts with the Soviet Union in 1938-39. This tipped the balance towards the 'South' plan, and the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] that precipitated the [[Pacific War]] in 1941.\n\n===Other ideological lines===\nThe [[Showa Studies Society]] was another \"think tank\" for future leaders of a radical totalitarian Japan, led by Count [[Yoriyasu Arima]]. He was a supporter of radical political experiments. He read [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Stirner]], and other radical philosophers. With [[Fumimaro Konoe]] and [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]], they created a revolutionary radical-right policy.\n\nThese revolutionary groups later had the help of several important personages, making reality to some certain ideas of the nationalist-militarist policy with practical work in [[Manchukuo]]. They included General [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], chief of [[Kempeitai]] and leader of [[Kwantung Army]]; [[Yosuke Matsuoka]], who served as president of the ([[South Manchuria Railway]] Company) and Foreign Affairs minister; and [[Naoki Hoshino]], an army ideologist who organized the government and political structure of Manchukuo. Tojo later became War Minister and Prime Minister in the Konoe cabinet, Matsuoka Foreign Minister, and Hoshino chief of Project departments charged with establishing a new economic structure for Japan. Some industrialists representative of this ideological strand were [[Ichiz\u014d Kobayashi]], President of [[Tokio Gasu Denki]], setting the structure for the Industry and Commerce ministry, and [[Sh\u014dz\u014d Murata]], representing the [[Sumitomo]] Group becoming Communication Minister.\n\nOther groups created were the Government [[Imperial Aid Association]]. Involved in both was Colonel [[Kingoro Hashimoto]], who proposed a Nationalist [[single party]] dictatorship, combined with a state-run economy. The militarists had strong support from the wealthy owners of major industries, but there were also certain socialist-nationalist sentiments on the part of radical officers.\n\nThe \"New Asia Day\" celebration was to remember the sacred mission of extending influence to nearby Asian nations.\n\nThe Japanese government, possibly following the German example of a \"Worker's Front\" State Syndicate, ultimately organized the [[Nation Service Society]] to group all the [[trades union]]s in the country. All syndicates of the \"Japanese Workers Federation\" were integrated into this controlling body.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Control of communications media===\n{{Main|Censorship in the Empire of Japan}}\n\nThe Press and other communication media were managed under the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Information Department of the Home Ministry]]. [[Radio Tokyo]] was charged with disseminating all official information around the world. The radio transmitted in English, Dutch, three Chinese dialects, Malay, Thai, as well Japanese to Southeast Asia; and the Islamic world had programs broadcast in Hindi, Burmese, Arabic, English and French. In [[Hawaii]], there were radio programs in English and Japanese. Other daily transmissions were to Europe, South and Central America, eastern areas of South America and the USA, with Australia and New Zealand receiving broadcasts too.\n\nThe official press agency [[Domei Tsushin]] was connected with the [[Axis powers]]' press agencies such as [[Deutsches Nachrichtenb\u00fcro|DNB]], [[Transoceanic]], the Italian agency [[Agenzia Stefani|Stefani]] and others. Local and Manchukoan newspapers such as ''Manchurian Daily News'' (Japanese-owned) were under the control of these institutions and only published officially approved notices and information.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Nationalist symbology==\n{{See also|National symbols of Japan}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Shiragiku (the chrysanthemum) ===\n<div style=\"float:right;margin-left:0.5em;\">\n<gallery>\nFile:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|[[National and Imperial Seal]]\nFile:Imperial Seal of Japan.jpg|[[Bow (ship)|Bow]] of the battleship [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']]\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\nThe ''shiragiku'' (lit. \"white chrysanthemum\") or more common [[chrysanthemum]] flower was much used as an imperial symbol. It alludes to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], the traditional [[Throne|seat]] of Japanese emperors.\n\n===Banzai===\nThe traditional cheer given to the Emperor and other dignitaries, or on special commemorations, was ''Tenno Heika Banzai'' (\u5929\u7687\u965b\u4e0b\u4e07\u6b73 or \u842c\u6b72, 'long live the Emperor') or the shortened form, [[Ten thousand years|''Banzai'']].\n\nThe latter term, which means \"ten thousand years,\" is an expression of Chinese origin (\u4e07\u6b73) adopted by the Japanese in the [[Meiji period]]. In its original sense, it is meant to represent an indeterminably lengthy time and is used to wish long life to a person, state, or project. As co-opted by the Japanese, it originally was simply used in this sense to wish long life to the Emperor (and by extension the Japanese state). As the [[World War II|war]] progressed, it became the typical Japanese war cry or victory shout and was used to encourage Imperial troops in combat.\n\n===Other nationalist symbols===\n*[[Flag of Japan]]\n*[[Rising Sun Flag]]\n*[[Good Luck Flag]] (signed war banner)\n*Five-point star badge ([[Imperial Japanese Army]] symbol)\n*Cherry blossom badge (with or without anchor) ([[Imperial Japanese Navy]] symbol)\n*[[Hachimaki]] headband\n*[[Senninbari]] (\"One-thousand stitch belt\")\n*[[Kimigayo]] (His Imperial Majesty's Reign)\n*[[Yasukuni Shrine]]\n\n==Post-war developments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n{{See also|Potsdam Declaration|Surrender of Japan}}\nIn February 1946, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was set the task of drafting a model constitution to serve as a guide for the Japanese people. The U.S. intention was to ensure that the sources of [[Japanese militarism]] were rooted out through fundamental reforms of the Japanese government, society, and economic structure. Perhaps the most lasting effect that came out of this constitution is [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] that reads:\n\n:\"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right to belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\"\n\nWith the renunciation of war and military power, Japan looked to the United States for security. As the [[Cold War]] began, the United States fostered a closer relationship with Japan due to the latter's strategic location in respect to the USSR. Japan became, as stated by the Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], an \"[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]\" for the United States. Ensuing from this close relationship with the United States, Japan hoped that in time their country would become the \"third leg in a triangle involving two superpowers.\" The seventies witnessed Japan's adoption of three fundamental tenets that would seek to define and direct Japanese internationalism, all concerning the need for Japanese initiatives in fostering a [[liberal internationalism]]. Japanese economic progress after World War II undermined the appeal of pre-war militarist nationalism, showing a path to prosperity was possible without colonies.\n\n==Nationalist right-wing groups==\n{{Main|Uyoku dantai}}\n\nIn 1996, the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] estimated that there were over 1,000 extremist right-wing groups in Japan, with about 100,000 members in total. These groups are known in Japanese as ''[[Uyoku dantai]]''. While there are political differences among the groups, they generally carry a philosophy of anti-leftism, hostility towards [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], and [[South Korea]], and justification of Japan's role in World War II. ''Uyoku dantai'' groups are well known for their highly visible [[Sound trucks in Japan|propaganda vehicles fitted with loudspeakers]] and prominently marked with the name of the group and propaganda slogans. The vehicles play patriotic or wartime-era songs.\n\nActivists affiliated with such groups have used [[Molotov cocktail]]s and time bombs to intimidate moderate politicians and public figures, including former Deputy Foreign Minister [[Hitoshi Tanaka]] and [[Fuji Xerox]] Chairman [[Yotaro Kobayashi]]. An ex-member of a right-wing group set fire to LDP politician [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Koichi Kato]]'s house. Koichi Kato and Yotaro Kobayashi had spoken out against Koizumi's visits to [[Yasukuni Shrine]].<ref>{{ cite news| title = The Rise of Japan's Thought Police| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501176.html |date=2006-08-27| first=Steven |last=Clemons | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nOpenly revisionist, [[Nippon Kaigi]] is considered \"the biggest right-wing organization in Japan\".<ref name=Narusawa>Muneo Narusawa, [http://japanfocus.org/-Narusawa-Muneo/3879 \"Abe Shinzo: Japan\u2019s New Prime Minister a Far-Right Denier of History\"], The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol 11, Issue 1, No. 1, January 14, 2013</ref><ref>The Economist of Britain on Jan. 5, 2013.

It encompasses a broad range of ideas and sentiments harbored by the [[Japanese people]] over the last two centuries regarding their native country, its cultural nature, political form and historical destiny. It is useful to distinguish Japanese [[cultural nationalism]] (see also [[nihonjinron]]) from political or state-directed nationalism (i.e., [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Sh\u014dwa statism]]), since many forms of cultural nationalism, such as those associated with [[Japanese folklore|folkloric studies]] (i.e., [[Yanagita Kunio]]), have been hostile to state-fostered nationalism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn [[Meiji period]] Japan, nationalist ideology consisted of a blend of native and imported [[political philosophies]], initially developed by the [[Meiji government]] to promote national unity and [[patriotism]], first in defense against [[colonization]] by Western powers, and later in a struggle to attain equality with the [[Great power|Great Powers]]. It evolved throughout the [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d]] and [[Sh\u014dwa period]]s to justify an increasingly [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government and [[Japanese expansionism|overseas expansionism]], and provided a political and ideological foundation for the actions of the Japanese military in the years leading up to [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Meiji period beginnings 1868\u20131912==\nDuring the final days of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the perceived threat of foreign encroachment, especially after the arrival of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] and the signing of the [[Kanagawa Accord]], led to increased prominence to the development of nationalist ideologies. Some prominent ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' promoted the concept of ''fukko'' (a return to the past), while others promoted ''\u014dsei'' (the Emperor's supreme authority). The terms were not mutually exclusive, merging into the ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians) concept, which in turn was a major driving force in starting the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe [[Meiji Constitution]] of 1889 defined allegiance to the State as the citizen's highest duty. While the constitution itself contained a mix of political Western practices and traditional Japanese political ideas, government philosophy increasingly centered on promoting [[social harmony]] and a sense of the [[nihonjinron|uniqueness of the Japanese people]] ''([[kokutai]])''.\n\n===Basis of economic growth===\nThe extreme disparity in economic and military power between Japan and the Western colonial powers was a great cause for concern for the early [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leadership]]. The motto ''[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei]]'' (enrich the country and strengthen the military) symbolized Meiji period nationalistic policies to provide government support to strengthen strategic industries. Only with a strong economic base could Japan afford to build a strong, modern military along Western lines, and only with a strong economy and military could Japan force a [[Unequal Treaties|revision of the unequal treaties]], such as the Kanagawa Accords. Government policies also laid the basis of later industrialist empires known as the ''[[zaibatsu]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=needs citation and neutral editing|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''Bushido'' (\u6b66\u58eb\u9053)===\nAs a residue of its widespread use in propaganda during the 19th century, military nationalism in Japan was often known as ''[[bushid\u014d]]'' (the way of the Samurai). The word, denoting a coherent code of beliefs and doctrines about the proper path of the [[samurai]], or what is called generically 'warrior thought' (\u6b66\u5bb6\u601d\u60f3, ''buke shis\u014d''), is rarely encountered in Japanese texts before the Meiji era, when the 11 volumes of the ''[[Hagakure]]'' of [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], compiled in the years from 1710 to 1716 where the character combination is employed, was finally published.\n\nConstituted over a long time by house manuals on war and warriorship, it gained some official backing with the establishment of the [[Bakufu]], which sought an ideological orthodoxy in the [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Zhu Xi]] tailored for military echelons that formed the basis of the new shogunal government.<ref>Grant K. Goodman, ''Japan and the Dutch 1600-1853'', Curzon Press, 2000, pp.1-8</ref> An important early role was played by [[Yamaga Sok\u014d]] in theorizing a Japanese military ethos. After the abolition of the feudal system, the new military institutions of Japan were shaped along European lines, with Western instructors, and the codes themselves modeled on standard models adapted from abroad. The impeccable behaviour, in terms of international criteria, displayed by the Japanese military in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] was proof that Japan finally had a modern army whose techniques, drilling and etiquette of war differed little from that of what prevailed among the Western imperial powers.{{Citation needed|reason=needs citation and neutral editing|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe ''[[Imperial Rescript for Seamen and Soldiers]]'' (1890), presented Japan as a \"sacred nation protected by the gods\". An undercurrent of traditional warrior values never wholly disappeared, and as Japan slid towards a cycle of repeated crises from the mid-Taish\u014d to early Sh\u014dwa eras, the old samurai ideals began to assume importance among more politicized officers in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. [[Sadao Araki]] played an important role in adapting a doctrine of ''[[seishin ky\u014diku]]'' (spiritual training) as an ideological backbone for army personnel. As [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Minister of Education]], he supported the integration of the samurai code into the national education system.\n\n===Role of ''Shinto''===\n{{Main|State Shinto}}\n\nIn developing the modern concepts of {{nihongo|[[State Shinto]]ism|\u56fd\u5bb6\u795e\u9053|kokka shint\u014d}} and [[emperor worship]], various Japanese philosophers tried to revive or purify national beliefs (''[[kokugaku]]'') by removing imported foreign ideas, borrowed primarily from [[Chinese philosophy]]. This \"Restoration Shint\u014dist Movement\" began with [[Motoori Norinaga]] in the 18th century. Motoori Norinaga, and later [[Hirata Atsutane]], based their research on the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and other classic Shint\u014d texts which teach the superiority of the Sun Goddess ''[[Amaterasu]]''. This formed the basis for State Shint\u014dism, as the [[Imperial Family of Japan|Japanese emperor]] claimed direct descent from ''Amaterasu''. The emperor himself was therefore sacred, and all proclamations of the emperor had thus a religious significance.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, the new imperial government needed to rapidly modernize the polity and [[economy of Japan]], and the Meiji oligarchy felt that those goals could only be accomplished through a strong sense of national unity and cultural identity, with State Shint\u014dism as an essential counterweight to the imported [[Buddhism]] of the past, the [[Christianity]] and other Western philosophies of the present.{{Citation needed|reason=needs citation and neutral editing|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1890, the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to \"offer yourselves courageously to the State\" as well as protect the Imperial family. The practice of emperor worship was further spread by distributing imperial portraits for esoteric veneration. All of these practices used to fortify national solidarity through patriotic centralized observance at shrines are said to have given pre-war Japanese nationalism a tint of [[mysticism]] and cultural introversion.<ref>Hall, Japan From Prehistory to Modern Times, page 328</ref>\n\nThe {{nihongo|''[[hakko ichiu]]''|\u516b\u7d18\u4e00\u5b87}} philosophy became popular during the Second Sino-Japanese War. This came to be regarded by [[Japanese militarism|militarists]] as a doctrine that the emperor was the center of the phenomenal world, lending religious impetus to ideas of Japanese territorial expansion.\n\n===Education===\n{{Main|Education in the Empire of Japan}}\n\nThe principal educational emphasis from the Meiji period was on the great importance of traditional national political values, religion and morality. The Imperial Rescript on Education of 1890 promoted a return to traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] in the hierarchal nature of human relations, with the State superior to the Individual, and the Emperor superior to the State. The Japanese state modernized organizationally, but preserved its national idiosyncrasies. The attitude reinforced from 1905 was that Japan was to be a powerful nation, equal at least to the Western powers. During the Sh\u014dwa period the educational system was used for supporting the militarized state and preparing future soldiers.\n\nThe government published official text books for all levels of student, and reinforced that with cultural activities, seminars, etc. Emphasis on the texts such as the ''Kokutai-no-shugi'' in schools was intended to emphasize the \"uniqueness of Japan\" from ancient centuries. These cultural courses were supplemented with military and survival courses against foreign invasion.\n\nApart from indoctrination in nationalism and religion, children and school students received military drills (survival, [[first aid]]). These were taken further by the [[Imperial Youth Federation]]; college students were trained, and some recruited, for home defense and regular military units. Young women received first aid training. All of these actions were said to be taken to ensure Japan's safety, and protect against larger and more dangerous countries.\n\n==Nationalist politics==\n\n===Origin of nationalist structures and parties===\n{{Main|Empire of Japan}}\n\nIn 1882, the Japanese Government organized the [[Teiseito]] (Imperial Gubernative Party), one of the first nationalist parties in the country. Starting from the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Japan adopted the moniker \"[[Empire of Japan|Dai Nippon Teikoku]]\", acquiring a colonial empire, with the acquisition of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyus]] (1879), [[Taiwan|Formosa]] (1895), the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Karafuto Prefecture|Karafuto]] (1905), the [[South Pacific Mandate]] islands (1918\u201319) and [[Korea|Joseon]] (Korea) (1905\u201310).\n\nThe wars against China and Russia were modern wars, and demanded a nationalist expression of patriotic sentiment. From this period, the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] (founded in 1869) was converted into a focus for nationalist sentiment, and received state patronage until the end of World War II. Yasukuni was dedicated to those Japanese and non-Japanese who had lost their lives serving Japan, and includes all war deaths from domestic and overseas conflicts from 1869\u20131945 (and none from any conflicts since 1945), but also civilians (women and students) and civil administration in colonies and occupied territories.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1928, the central government organized the \"Peace Preservation Department\" (an antisubversive police section), and prosecuted all local [[Communism|communist]]s who proposed a [[Socialism|socialist]] form of government. The Japanese Army organized the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' (military police service). Dissent was controlled by the usage of political and [[Censorship in the Empire of Japan|press repression]], with the [[Peace Preservation Law]] permitting police to restrict freedom of expression and freedom to assemble.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1935, the Nippon Shimbun (\u65e5\u672c\u65b0\u805e) promoted nationalist ideology and sought to influence the Japanese political landscape.  In spite of a relatively small overall circulation, it had wide readership among right-wing politicians and advocated the concept of the divine right of the emperor by vigorously attacking [[Tatsukichi Minobe]]'s \u201cemperor organ theory\u201d.<ref name=nhk>{{cite web | title=\u6226\u524d\u6700\u5927\u306e\u53f3\u6d3e\u65b0\u805e\u7d0410\u5e74\u5206\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308b|url=https://www.nhk.or.jp/politics/articles/lastweek/21287.html| publisher=[[NHK]]|date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name=nhk2>{{cite web | title=The Fall of Freedom - How a newspaper led Japan to war|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/documentary/20191013/4001341/| publisher=[[NHK]]|date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Realities of political power===\n[[File:Naval ensign of the Empire of Japan.svg|thumb|[[Kyokujitsu-ki]] (the sun-with rays-flag) It was the [[ensign]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]; and is now employed by [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] Ships]]\n[[File:Rising sun flag.JPG|thumb|[[Naval ensign]] of the battleship [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']]]]\nSince the Meiji restoration, the central figure of the state was the [[emperor]]. According to the constitution, the emperor was [[Head of State]] (article 4) and Supreme Commander of the Army and the Navy (article 11). [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] was also, from 1937, the commander of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]]. Japanese citizens were rallied to the \"Defensive State\" or \"Consensus State\", in which all efforts of the nation supported collective objectives, by guidance from [[national myths]], history, and dogma \u2014 thus obtaining a \"national consensus\". Democratic institutions were installed in 1890 with the promulgation of a constitution and continued to acquire legitimacy until the 1920s, when they fell into disrepute.\n\nConcerns that irresponsible political parties could have too great an influence over vital military affairs introduced a rule that the Army alone should nominate the Army Minister in civilian government. This permitted the army to have a ''[[de facto]]'' [[veto]] over civilian governments by having the power to refuse to nominate a candidate. This policy was introduced in law in 1900 but abolished in 1913. It was reintroduced in 1936, cementing military influence over government after that time.\n\nThe political system of Japan became subverted by the military throughout the 1930s from repeated attempted coups, and independent militarist interventions. The invasion of Manchuria after elements in the army manufactured an incident to justify a takeover was accomplished without instruction from the Tokyo government. This showed the impotence of the civilian government to have any influence over the impulses of the army. Governments become increasingly passive, allowing agency and direction of the state to fall to disparate competing elements of the army. The role of the emperor remained highly prestigious, with various factions competing to advocate their interpretation of what the emperor \"truly\" wanted.\n\nAfter the war, scrutiny of the emperor's role in the war and militarism intensified. For many historians such as [[Akira Fujiwara]], Akira Yamada, Peter Wetzler, [[Herbert Bix]] and [[John W. Dower|John Dower]], the work done by [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] during the first months of the [[occupation of Japan]] to exonerate Hirohito and all the imperial family from criminal prosecutions in the [[Tokyo tribunal]] was the predominant factor in the campaign to diminish in retrospect the role played by the emperor during the war. They argue that post-war view focused on the imperial conferences and missed the numerous \"behind the chrysanthemum curtain\" meetings where the real decisions were made between [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]], his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. For Fujiwara, \"the thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision, is a myth fabricated after the war.\"<ref>''Sh\u014dwa tenn\u014d no 15 nen sens\u014d'' ''(The Sh\u014dwa emperor fifteen years war)'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref>\n\n===Political ideas===\nDuring the 1920s, right-wing nationalist beliefs became an increasingly dominant force. State support for Shinto encouraged a belief in the mythological history of Japan and thus led to mysticism and cultural chauvinism. Some secret societies took up [[nationalism#ultranationalism|ultranationalism]] and Japan-centered radical ideas. They included: ''[[Geny\u014dsha]]'' (Black Ocean Society, 1881), ''[[Kokuryu-kai]]'' (Amur River Society, or Black Dragon Society, 1901), movements dedicated to overseas Japanese expansion to the north; ''[[Nihon Kokusui Kai]]'' (Japanese Patriotic Society, 1919), founded by [[Tokoname Takejiro]]; ''[[Sekka Boshidan]]'' (Anti-Red League) founded at the same time as the [[Japanese Communist Party]]; and the ''[[Kokuhonsha]]'' (State Basis Society) founded in 1924 by [[Baron Hiranuma]], for the preservation of the unique national character of Japan and its special mission in Asia.\n\nSome of the nationalist ideas can be attributed to the ideologue [[Ikki Kita]] (1885\u20131937), an Amur River Society member. In his 1919 book ''An Outline Plan for the Reorganization of Japan'', Kita proposed a military ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' to promote the supposed true aims of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. This book was banned, but certain military circles read in it in the early 1930s. Kita's plan was phrased in terms of freeing the Emperor from weak or treasonous counsellors. After suspending the constitution, and dissolving the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], the Emperor and his military defenders should work for a \"collectivist direct voluntarism\" to unify people and leaders. Harmony with the [[working class]]es would be sought by the abolition of the aristocracy and austerity for the Imperial House. Overseas, Japan would [[Anti-Western sentiment|free]] Asia of Western influence. The Amur River Society was later instrumental in the Manchurian incident.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Political nationalist movements===\nThe Japanese Navy was in general terms more traditionalist, in defending ancient values and the sacred nature of the Emperor; the Japanese Army was more forward-looking, in the sense of valuing primarily strong leadership, as is evidenced by the use of the ''coup'' and direct action. The Navy typically preferred political methods. The Army, ultimately, was the vehicle for the hypernationalists, anti-communists, anticapitalists, antiparliamentarians, and Nationalist-Militarist ideals.\n\nThe military were considered politically \"clean\" in terms of [[political corruption]], additionally assuming responsibility for 'restoring' the security of the nation. The armed forces took up criticism of the traditional democratic parties and regular government for many reasons (low funds for the armed forces, compromised national security, weakness of the leaders). They were also, by their composition, closely aware of the effects of economic depression on the middle and lower classes, and the [[communist]] threat.\n\nBoth branches gained in power as they administered the exterior provinces and military preparations.\n\n===Nationalist right in the 1920s===\nOther nationalist rightist groups in the 1920s were the ''Jinmu Kai'' ([[Emperor Jimmu]] Society), ''Tenketo Kai'' (Heaven Spade Party), ''Ketsumeidan'' (Blood Fraternity) and ''[[Sakura Kai]]'' (Cherry Blossom Society) . This last was founded by Dr. [[Sh\u016bmei \u014ckawa]], professor of the Colonization Academy, and radical defender of expansionism and military armed revolution at home. Amongst members were Army officers implicated in the Manchuria Affair, such as [[Kingoro Hashimoto]], and [[Ishikawa Kanishi]]. Okawa served as a conduit by which [[Kita Ikki]]'s ideas reached young nationalist officers on the right.\n\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and Nobusuke Kishi in 1943.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] (right) and [[Nobusuke Kishi]], October 1943]]\nViolent ''coups'' took place, and the [[Kwantung Army]] made, in effect unilaterally, the decision to invade Manchuria. This was then treated as a ''fait accompli'' by Government and Emperor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Doctrines===\nThe [[Amau Doctrine]] (the \"Asian [[Monroe Doctrine]]\") stated that Japan assumed the total responsibility for peace in Asia. Minister [[K\u014dki Hirota]] proclaimed \"a special zone, anti-communist, pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo\" and that Northern China was a \"fundamental part\" of Japanese national existence, in announcing a \"holy war\" against the Soviet Union and China as the \"national mission\".\n\nDuring 1940 [[Prince Konoe]] proclaimed the ''Shintaisei'' (New National Structure), making Japan into an \"advanced state of National Defense\", and the creation of the ''[[Taisei Yokusankai]]'' (Imperial Authority Assistance Association), for organizing a centralized \"consensus state\". Associated are the government creation of the ''[[Tonarigumi]]'' (residents' committees). Other ideological creations of the time were the book \"[[Shinmin no Michi]]\" (\u81e3\u6c11\u306e\u9053), the \"Imperial Way\" or \"War Party\" (''[[Kodoha]]'') Army party, the \"Yamato spirit\" (''[[Yamato-damashii]]''), and the idea of ''[[hakko ichiu]]'' (which directly translates to \"8 corners under one roof\", that means, \"one house in which every people can live\" or \"everyone is family\"), \"Religion and Government Unity\" (''Saisei itchi''), and ''Kokka Sodoin Ho'' (General Mobilization Right).\n\nThe official academic texts included ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]]'' and ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]''. Both presented a view of Japan's history and the Japanese ideal to unite East and West.\n\n===Geostrategy===\n{{Main|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\n[[File:Japanese Empire - 1942.svg|thumb|[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] at its greatest extent]]\nThe economic doctrines of the \"[[Yen block]]\" were in 1941 transformed to the \"Great Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" Plan, as a basis for the Japanese national finances, and conquest plans. There was a history of perhaps two decades behind these moves.\n\nThe [[Japanese Geopolitics prewar and wartimes (WW2)|Japanese theorists]], such as [[Saneshige Komaki]], concerned with Mainland Asia, knew the [[geostrategy|geostrategic]] theory of [[Halford Mackinder]], expressed in the book ''Democratic Ideas and Reality''. He discussed why the 'World Island' of Eurasia and Africa was dominant, and why the key to this was the 'Central Land' in [[Central Asia]]. This is protected from sea attack, by deserts and mountains, and is vulnerable only on its west side, and to advanced technology from Europe.\n\nMackinder declared that: \"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World\". These central Asiatic lands included: all of the Soviet Union, except the Pacific coast, west of the [[Volga river]]; all [[Mongolia]], [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]], [[Tibet]] and [[Iran]]. This zone is vast and possesses natural resources and raw materials, does not possess major farming possibilities, and has very little population. Mackinder thought in terms of land and sea power: the latter can outflank the former, and carry out distant [[logistical]] operations, but needs adequate bases.\n\nThese geopolitical ideas coincided with the theories of Lieutenant Colonel [[Kanji Ishiwara]], sent in 1928 to Manchuria to spy. The Army adopted them, in the form of the [[Hokushin-ron|Strike North Group]]. The Navy, on the other hand, was interested in the [[Nanshin-ron|southerly direction]] of expansion. An extended debate ensued, resolved in the end by the stern experience of Japan's armed conflicts with the Soviet Union in 1938-39. This tipped the balance towards the 'South' plan, and the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] that precipitated the [[Pacific War]] in 1941.\n\n===Other ideological lines===\nThe [[Showa Studies Society]] was another \"think tank\" for future leaders of a radical totalitarian Japan, led by Count [[Yoriyasu Arima]]. He was a supporter of radical political experiments. He read [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Stirner]], and other radical philosophers. With [[Fumimaro Konoe]] and [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]], they created a revolutionary radical-right policy.\n\nThese revolutionary groups later had the help of several important personages, making reality to some certain ideas of the nationalist-militarist policy with practical work in [[Manchukuo]]. They included General [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], chief of [[Kempeitai]] and leader of [[Kwantung Army]]; [[Yosuke Matsuoka]], who served as president of the ([[South Manchuria Railway]] Company) and Foreign Affairs minister; and [[Naoki Hoshino]], an army ideologist who organized the government and political structure of Manchukuo. Tojo later became War Minister and Prime Minister in the Konoe cabinet, Matsuoka Foreign Minister, and Hoshino chief of Project departments charged with establishing a new economic structure for Japan. Some industrialists representative of this ideological strand were [[Ichiz\u014d Kobayashi]], President of [[Tokio Gasu Denki]], setting the structure for the Industry and Commerce ministry, and [[Sh\u014dz\u014d Murata]], representing the [[Sumitomo]] Group becoming Communication Minister.\n\nOther groups created were the Government [[Imperial Aid Association]]. Involved in both was Colonel [[Kingoro Hashimoto]], who proposed a Nationalist [[single party]] dictatorship, combined with a state-run economy. The militarists had strong support from the wealthy owners of major industries, but there were also certain socialist-nationalist sentiments on the part of radical officers.\n\nThe \"New Asia Day\" celebration was to remember the sacred mission of extending influence to nearby Asian nations.\n\nThe Japanese government, possibly following the German example of a \"Worker's Front\" State Syndicate, ultimately organized the [[Nation Service Society]] to group all the [[trades union]]s in the country. All syndicates of the \"Japanese Workers Federation\" were integrated into this controlling body.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Control of communications media===\n{{Main|Censorship in the Empire of Japan}}\n\nThe Press and other communication media were managed under the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Information Department of the Home Ministry]]. [[Radio Tokyo]] was charged with disseminating all official information around the world. The radio transmitted in English, Dutch, three Chinese dialects, Malay, Thai, as well Japanese to Southeast Asia; and the Islamic world had programs broadcast in Hindi, Burmese, Arabic, English and French. In [[Hawaii]], there were radio programs in English and Japanese. Other daily transmissions were to Europe, South and Central America, eastern areas of South America and the USA, with Australia and New Zealand receiving broadcasts too.\n\nThe official press agency [[Domei Tsushin]] was connected with the [[Axis powers]]' press agencies such as [[Deutsches Nachrichtenb\u00fcro|DNB]], [[Transoceanic]], the Italian agency [[Agenzia Stefani|Stefani]] and others. Local and Manchukoan newspapers such as ''Manchurian Daily News'' (Japanese-owned) were under the control of these institutions and only published officially approved notices and information.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Nationalist symbology==\n{{See also|National symbols of Japan}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Shiragiku (the chrysanthemum) ===\n<div style=\"float:right;margin-left:0.5em;\">\n<gallery>\nFile:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|[[National and Imperial Seal]]\nFile:Imperial Seal of Japan.jpg|[[Bow (ship)|Bow]] of the battleship [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']]\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\nThe ''shiragiku'' (lit. \"white chrysanthemum\") or more common [[chrysanthemum]] flower was much used as an imperial symbol. It alludes to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], the traditional [[Throne|seat]] of Japanese emperors.\n\n===Banzai===\nThe traditional cheer given to the Emperor and other dignitaries, or on special commemorations, was ''Tenno Heika Banzai'' (\u5929\u7687\u965b\u4e0b\u4e07\u6b73 or \u842c\u6b72, 'long live the Emperor') or the shortened form, [[Ten thousand years|''Banzai'']].\n\nThe latter term, which means \"ten thousand years,\" is an expression of Chinese origin (\u4e07\u6b73) adopted by the Japanese in the [[Meiji period]]. In its original sense, it is meant to represent an indeterminably lengthy time and is used to wish long life to a person, state, or project. As co-opted by the Japanese, it originally was simply used in this sense to wish long life to the Emperor (and by extension the Japanese state). As the [[World War II|war]] progressed, it became the typical Japanese war cry or victory shout and was used to encourage Imperial troops in combat.\n\n===Other nationalist symbols===\n*[[Flag of Japan]]\n*[[Rising Sun Flag]]\n*[[Good Luck Flag]] (signed war banner)\n*Five-point star badge ([[Imperial Japanese Army]] symbol)\n*Cherry blossom badge (with or without anchor) ([[Imperial Japanese Navy]] symbol)\n*[[Hachimaki]] headband\n*[[Senninbari]] (\"One-thousand stitch belt\")\n*[[Kimigayo]] (His Imperial Majesty's Reign)\n*[[Yasukuni Shrine]]\n\n==Post-war developments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n{{See also|Potsdam Declaration|Surrender of Japan}}\nIn February 1946, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was set the task of drafting a model constitution to serve as a guide for the Japanese people. The U.S. intention was to ensure that the sources of [[Japanese militarism]] were rooted out through fundamental reforms of the Japanese government, society, and economic structure. Perhaps the most lasting effect that came out of this constitution is [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] that reads:\n\n:\"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right to belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\"\n\nWith the renunciation of war and military power, Japan looked to the United States for security. As the [[Cold War]] began, the United States fostered a closer relationship with Japan due to the latter's strategic location in respect to the USSR. Japan became, as stated by the Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], an \"[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]\" for the United States. Ensuing from this close relationship with the United States, Japan hoped that in time their country would become the \"third leg in a triangle involving two superpowers.\" The seventies witnessed Japan's adoption of three fundamental tenets that would seek to define and direct Japanese internationalism, all concerning the need for Japanese initiatives in fostering a [[liberal internationalism]]. Japanese economic progress after World War II undermined the appeal of pre-war militarist nationalism, showing a path to prosperity was possible without colonies.\n\n==Nationalist right-wing groups==\n{{Main|Uyoku dantai}}\n\nIn 1996, the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] estimated that there were over 1,000 extremist right-wing groups in Japan, with about 100,000 members in total. These groups are known in Japanese as ''[[Uyoku dantai]]''. While there are political differences among the groups, they generally carry a philosophy of anti-leftism, hostility towards [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], and [[South Korea]], and justification of Japan's role in World War II. ''Uyoku dantai'' groups are well known for their highly visible [[Sound trucks in Japan|propaganda vehicles fitted with loudspeakers]] and prominently marked with the name of the group and propaganda slogans. The vehicles play patriotic or wartime-era songs.\n\nActivists affiliated with such groups have used [[Molotov cocktail]]s and time bombs to intimidate moderate politicians and public figures, including former Deputy Foreign Minister [[Hitoshi Tanaka]] and [[Fuji Xerox]] Chairman [[Yotaro Kobayashi]]. An ex-member of a right-wing group set fire to LDP politician [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Koichi Kato]]'s house. Koichi Kato and Yotaro Kobayashi had spoken out against Koizumi's visits to [[Yasukuni Shrine]].<ref>{{ cite news| title = The Rise of Japan's Thought Police| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501176.html |date=2006-08-27| first=Steven |last=Clemons | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nOpenly revisionist, [[Nippon Kaigi]] is considered \"the biggest right-wing organization in Japan\".<ref name=Narusawa>Muneo Narusawa, [http://japanfocus.org/-Narusawa-Muneo/3879 \"Abe Shinzo: Japan\u2019s New Prime Minister a Far-Right Denier of History\"], The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol 11, Issue 1, No. 1, January 14, 2013</ref><ref>The Economist of Britain on Jan. 5, 2013.
