In 2005 he received the [[Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years]] award for his legendary film, ''[[Sholay]]''.\n\nHe has produced films directed by his son [[Rohan Sippy]], such as ''[[Kuch Naa Kaho]]'' (2003), ''[[Bluffmaster]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dum Maaro Dum (film)|Dum Maro Dum]]'' (2011). In 2006 he produced ''[[Taxi No. 9211]]'' which was directed by [[Milan Luthria]]. In 2008 he produced [[Kunaal Roy Kapur]]'s ''The President is Coming'' as well as the [[Akshay Kumar]]-[[Deepika Padukone]] film, ''[[Chandni Chowk to China]]'', directed by [[Nikhil Advani]].\n\nSippy's 1995 film ''Zamana Deewana'' was poorly received by audiences and critics, and led to the director abandoning film-making for almost 20 years.  In 2015, he finished shooting his next film, ''Shimla Mirchi'', a comedy film starring [[Rajkummar Rao]], [[Rakul Preet Singh]], and [[Hema Malini]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/rajkummar-rao-wraps-up-shoot-for-shimla-mirchi-762455|title=Rajkummar Rao Wraps up Shoot For Shimla Mirchi \u2013 NDTV Movies|date=12 May 2015|work=NDTVMovies.com|access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref> The film had difficulty attracting buyers as of July 2018, and has not been released.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/280316/ramesh-sippy-s-comeback-film-simla-mirch-starring-hema-malini-has-no-buyers.html|title=Ramesh Sippy's comeback film Shimla Mirchi starring Hema Malini has no buyers|date=28 March 2016|work=deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n* [[Filmfare Special Award|Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years]] for ''[[Sholay]]'' in 2005<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://starsunfolded.com/ramesh-sippy/|title=Ramesh Sippy Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More \u00bb StarsUnfolded|website=StarsUnfolded|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n* IIFA Award for outstanding contribution to the Indian cinema (Male) in 2012<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Padma Shri]] in 2013<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2020.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Director===\n* ''[[Shimla Mirchi (film)|Shimla Mirchi]]'' (2020)\n* ''[[Zamana Deewana]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Akayla]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Bhrashtachar]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Buniyaad]]'' (1987) television drama-series\n* ''[[Zameen (film)#Zameen (1987)|Zameen]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Saagar (1985 film)|Saagar]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Shakti (1982 film)|Shakti]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Seeta Aur Geeta]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Andaz (1971 film)|Andaz]]'' (1971)\n\n===Producer===\n*''[[Sonali Cable]]'' (2014)\n*''[[Nautanki Saala]]'' (2013)\n*''[[Dum Maaro Dum (film)|Dum Maaro Dum]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Chandni Chowk to China]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Fear (2007 film)|Fear]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Taxi No. 9211]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Bluffmaster!]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Kuch Naa Kaho]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Trishna (1978 film)|Trishna]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Brahmachari (Hindi film)|Brahmachari]]'' (1968)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Anupama|authorlink=Anupama Chopra|title=[[Sholay: The Making of a Classic]]|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books, India|isbn=0-14-029970-X}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb name|id=00802693|name = Ramesh Sippy }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sippy, Ramesh}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian film directors]]\n[[Category:Film producers from Mumbai]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language film directors]]\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:People from Karachi]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sindhi people]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in arts]]\n[[Category:Film directors from Mumbai]]\n", "name_user": "Mujtaba21", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I have added a new sentence and also included an external link to a website for which ramesh sippy is founder and director)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Sippy"}
