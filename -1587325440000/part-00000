It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet.

(2015). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (4th edition). Wiley.</ref>\n\nThe field of anthropology originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.&nbsp;B. Tylor]] (1832\u20131917) from Britain and [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818\u20131881), an American scientist, were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. [[Franz Boas]] (1858\u20131942), [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] (1884\u20141942), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887\u20131948), and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901\u20131978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of [[cultural relativism]] to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and this became the origin of field work and field methods.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller]] developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733\u201343) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated ''V\u00f6lker-Beschreibung'' as a distinct area of study. This became known as \"ethnography,\" following the introduction of the Greek neologism ''ethnographia''  by Johann Friedrich Sch\u00f6pperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[August Ludwig von Schl\u00f6zer]] and [[Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer]] of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.<ref name=\":0\">Vermeulen, Han F., 2008, ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment'', Leiden, p. 199.</ref><ref name=\"Vermeulen\">{{cite book|last = Vermeulen|first = Hans|title = Early History of Ethnograph and Ethnolog in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710-1808|year = 2008|publisher = Privately published|location = Leiden}}</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]], known as the Father of History, had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the Hellenic realm such as the [[Scythians]], which earned him the title \"philobarbarian\", and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography.\n\n==Forms==\n\nThere are different forms of ethnography: confessional ethnography; life history; feminist ethnography etc. Two popular forms of ethnography are realist ethnography and critical ethnography. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)\n\nRealist ethnography is a traditional approach used by cultural anthropologists. Characterized by Van Maanen (1988), it reflects a particular instance taken by the researcher toward the individual being studied. It's an objective study of the situation. It's composed from a third person's perspective by getting the data from the members on the site. The ethnographer stays as omniscient correspondent of actualities out of sight. The realist reports information in a measured style ostensibly uncontaminated by individual predisposition, political objectives, and judgment. The analyst will give a detailed report of the everyday life of the individuals under study. The ethnographer also uses standard categories for cultural description (e.g., family life, communication network). The ethnographer produces the participant's views through closely edited quotations and has the final word on how the culture is to be interpreted and presented. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)\n\nCritical ethnography is a kind of ethnographic research in which the creators advocate for the liberation of groups which are marginalized in society. Critical researchers typically are politically minded people who look to take a stand of opposition to inequality and domination.  For example, a critical ethnographer might study schools that provide privileges to certain types of students, or counseling practices that serve to overlook the needs of underrepresented groups. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94). The important components of a critical ethnographer are to incorporate a value-laden introduction, empower people by giving them more authority, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control. A critical ethnographer will study issues of power, empowerment, inequality, inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony, and victimization. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)\n\n<big>'''Digital Ethnography'''</big>\n\nDigital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography. This type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil. Digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies. Traditional ethnography may use videos or images, but digital ethnography goes more in-depth. For example, digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as Twitter or blogs so that people's interactions and behaviors can be studied.\n\n<big>'''Relational Ethnography'''</big>\n\nMost ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved. Relational Ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people. Meaning that relational ethnography doesn't take an object nor a bounded group that is defined by its members shared social features nor a specific location that is delimited by the boundaries of a particular area. But rather the processes involving configurations of relations among different agents or institutions.\n\n==Features of ethnographic research==\nAccording to Dewan (2018), the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions.<ref>(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An \u2018Exotic\u2019 Ethnographer\u2019s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore).</ref>\n\n* Involves investigation of very few cases, maybe just one case, in detail.\n* Often involves working with primarily unconstructed data. This data had not been coded at the point of data collection in terms of a closed set of analytic categories.\n* Emphasizes on exploring social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses.\n* Data analysis involves interpretation of the functions and meanings of human actions. The product of this is mainly verbal explanations, where statistical analysis and quantification play a subordinate role. \n* Methodological discussions focus more on questions about how to report findings in the field than on methods of data collection and interpretation.\n* Ethnographies focus on describing the culture of a group in very detailed and complex manner. The ethnography can be of the entire group or a subpart of it. \n* It involves engaging in extensive field work where data collection is mainly by interviews, symbols, artifacts, observations, and many other sources of data. \n* The researcher in ethnography type of research looks for patterns of the group's mental activities, that is their ideas and beliefs expressed through language or other activities, and how they behave in their groups as expressed through their actions that the researcher observed.\n* In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Procedures for conducting ethnography==\n\n* Determine if ethnography is the most appropriate design to use to study the research problem. Ethnography is suitable if the needs are to describe how a cultural group works and to explore their beliefs, language, behaviours and also issues faced by the group, such as power, resistance, and dominance. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)\n*  Then identify and locate a culture-sharing group to study.  This group is one whose members have been together for an extended period of time, so that their shared language, patterns of behaviour and attitudes have merged into discernible patterns. This group can also be a group that has been marginalized by society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)\n* Select cultural themes, issues or theories to study about the group. These themes, issues, and theories provide an orienting framework for the study of the culture-sharing group. As discussed by [[Martyn Hammersley|Hammersley]] and Atkinson (2007), Wolcott (1987, 1994b, 2008-1), and Fetterman (2009). The ethnographer begins the study by examining people in interaction in ordinary settings and discerns pervasive patterns such as life cycles, events, and cultural themes. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94-95)\n* For studying cultural concepts, determine which type of ethnography to use. Perhaps how the group works need to be described, or a critical ethnography can expose issues such as power, hegemony, and advocacy for certain groups (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)\n* Should collect information in the context or setting where the group works or lives. This is called fieldwork. Types of information typically needed in ethnography are collected by going to the research site, respecting the daily lives of individuals at the site and collecting a wide variety of materials. Field issues of respect, reciprocity, deciding who owns the data and others are central to Ethnography (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)\n*  From the many sources collected, the ethnographer analyzes the data for a description of the culture-sharing group, themes that emerge from the group and an overall interpretation (Wolcott, 1994b). The researcher begins to compile a detailed description of the culture-sharing group, by focusing on a single event, on several activities, or on the group over a prolonged period of time.\n*   Forge a working set of rules or generalizations as to how the culture-sharing group works as the final product of this analysis. The final product is a holistic cultural portrait of the group that incorporates the views of the participants (emic) as well as the views of the researcher (etic). It might also advocate for the needs of the group or suggest changes in society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 96)\n\n==As method==\nThe ethnographic method is different from other ways of conducting social science approach due to the following reasons:\n[[File:Rozmowa z tw\u00f3rczyniami tradycyjnych, wo\u0142oskich pisanek.jpg|thumb|An ethnographer conducting field interviews, [[Wallachian Open Air Museum|Vala\u0161sk\u00e9 muzeum v p\u0159\u00edrod\u011b]]]]\n* It is field-based. It is conducted in the settings in which real people actually live, rather than in laboratories where the researcher controls the elements of the behaviors to be observed or measured.\n* It is personalized. It is conducted by researchers who are in the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the people they are studying and who are thus both participants in and observers of the lives under study.\n* It is multifactorial. It is conducted through the use of two or more data collection techniques - which may be qualitative or quantitative in nature - in order to get a conclusion.\n* It requires a long-term commitment i.e. it is conducted by a researcher who intends to interact with people they are studying for an extended period of time.  The exact time frame can vary from several weeks to a year or more.\n* It is inductive. It is conducted in such a way to use an accumulation of descriptive detail to build toward general patterns or explanatory theories rather than structured to test hypotheses derived from existing theories or models.\n* It is dialogic.  It is conducted by a researcher whose interpretations and findings may be expounded on by the study's participants while conclusions are still in the process of formulation.\n* It is holistic. It is conducted so as to yield the fullest possible portrait of the group under study.\n* It can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Data collection methods==\n[[File:Izmir Ethnography Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Izmir Ethnography Museum]] (\u0130zmir Etnografya M\u00fczesi), [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]], from the courtyard]]\n[[File:Ethnography Museum Budapest architecture.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnography museum]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]\nAccording to [[John David Brewer|John Brewer]], a leading social scientist, data collection methods are meant to capture the \"social meanings and ordinary activities\"<ref name=\"brewer\">[Brewer, John D. (2000). ''Ethnography.'' Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.10.]</ref> of people (informants) in \"naturally occurring settings\"<ref name=\"brewer\" /> that are commonly referred to as \"the field.\"  The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data.<ref name=\"brewer\" />  Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community.  These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews, and surveys.\n\nInterviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic.  In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to \"discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies\".<ref>[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/kinship.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.\n\nIn order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be \"reflexive\". Reflexivity refers to the researcher's aim \"to explore the ways in which [the] researcher's involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research\".<ref>[Nightingale, David & Cromby, John. ''Social Constructionist Psychology: A Critical Analysis of Theory and Practice''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.228.]</ref>  Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.\n\nTraditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well.<ref name=\"G1\">{{cite book |last=Garson |first=G. David |url=http://www.statisticalassociates.com/ethnography.htm |title=Ethnographic Research |year=2015 }}{{page needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling.<ref name=\"G1\"/> This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied.<ref name=\"G1\"/> Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience. Participation, rather than just observation, is one of the keys to this process.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Genzuk |first1=Michael |year=1999 |chapterurl=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~genzuk/Ethnographic_Research.html |chapter=Tapping Into Community Funds of Knowledge |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023021956/http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~genzuk/Ethnographic_Research.html |archivedate=October 13, 2018 |title=Effective Strategies for English Language Acquisition: A Curriculum Guide for the Development of Teachers, Grades Kindergarten through Eight }}</ref> Ethnography is very useful in social research.\n\nYbema ''et al.'' (2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography.  Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing \"the interplay of individual agency and social structure.\"<ref>S. Ybema, D. Yanow, H. Wels, & F. Kamsteeg (2010). \"Ethnography.\" In A. Mills, G. Durepos, & E. Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.'' (pp. 348-352). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.</ref> Critical theory researchers address \"issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power.\"\n\nAnother form of data collection is that of the \"image.\" The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual's perspective, primarily based on that individual's past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of \"I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Lynda|title=Lynda Barry: The answer is in the picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmT4wLWksOw|website=YouTube|publisher=INKtalks|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.\n\n== Differences across disciplines ==\nThe ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists but also occasionally by sociologists.

E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''Naven'' (1936, 1958) by [[Gregory Bateson]], or \"[[The Lele of the Kasai]]\" (1963) by [[Mary Douglas]]. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on [[emic]] views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common.<ref>Naroll, Raoul. ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology.''</ref>  Ethnographies are also sometimes called \"case studies.\"<ref>Chavez, Leo. ''Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Workers in American Society'' (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology). 1997, Prentice Hall.</ref>  Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on [[fieldwork]]. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life. Ruth Fulton Benedict uses examples of Enthrotyhy in her serious of field work that began in 1922 of Serrano, of the Zuni in 1924, the Cochiti in 1925 and the Pina in 1926. All being people she wished to study for her anthropological data. Benedict's experiences with the Southwest Zuni pueblo is to be considered the basis of her formative fieldwork. The experience set the idea for her to produce her theory of \u201cculture is personality writ large\u201d (modell, 1988). By studying the culture between the different Pueblo and Plain Indians, She discovered the culture isomorphism that would be considered her personalized unique approach to the study of anthropology using ethnographic techniques.\n\n[[File:Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski among Trobriand tribe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] among [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand]] tribe]]\n[[File:No\u0107 muzeja 2014, \u010cakovec - poljoprivredni izlo\u0161ci.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the ethnographic collection of the [[Me\u0111imurje County Museum]] in [[Croatia]]]]\nA typical ethnography attempts to be [[holistic]]<ref name=\"Ember 2006\"/><ref name=\"Heider, Karl 2001\"/> and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the [[physical geography]] or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including [[climate]], and often including what biological anthropologists call [[habitat]]. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure.  Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics.<ref>cf.

In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a [[Empirical research|phenomenological]] approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about \"webs\" instead of \"outlines\"<ref>Geertz, Clifford. ''The Interpretation of Culture,'' Chapter one.</ref> of culture.\n\nWithin cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography.  Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing \"bio-confessional\" ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research.  Famous examples include ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]'' (1955) by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, ''The High Valley'' by Kenneth Read, and ''The Savage and the Innocent'' by [[David Maybury-Lewis]], as well as the mildly fictionalized ''Return to Laughter'' by Elenore Smith Bowen ([[Laura Bohannan]]).\n\nLater \"[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]\" ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer.  Famous examples include ''Deep Play:  Notes on a Balinese Cockfight'' by [[Clifford Geertz]],  ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' by [[Paul Rabinow]], ''The Headman and I'' by Jean-Paul Dumont, and ''Tuhami'' by Vincent Crapanzano.  In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of [[literary theory]] and [[postcolonial|post-colonial]]/[[post-structuralist]] thought.  \"Experimental\" ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include ''Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man'' by [[Michael Taussig]], ''Debating Muslims'' by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, ''A Space on the Side of the Road'' by Kathleen Stewart, and ''Advocacy after Bhopal'' by Kim Fortun.\n\nThis critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, ''Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'', (1986) edited by [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]. ''Writing Culture'' helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern,' 'reflexive,' 'literary,' 'deconstructive,' or 'poststructural' in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.<ref>Olaf Zenker & Karsten Kumoll. ''Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices.'' (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pgs. 1-4</ref>\n\nWhere Geertz's and [[Victor Turner|Turner's]] interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible.<ref>Paul A. Erickson & Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory,'' Third Edition. (2008). Toronto: Broadview Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-871-0}}. Pg. 190</ref> In regards to this last point, ''Writing Culture'' became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority.<ref>Erickson & Murphy (2008). A History of Anthropological Theory, Pgs. 190-191</ref> Along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology,' 'narrative ethnography,'<ref>{{cite web |first1=Kristen |last1=Ghodsee |title=Writing Ethnographies that Ordinary People Can Read |work=Anthropology News |date=May 24, 2013 |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/writing_ethnographies.pdf }}</ref> and 'literary ethnography',<ref>Literary Ethnography http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/</ref> ''Writing Culture'' helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography.'<ref name=\"ZenkerKumoll\">Olaf Zenker & Karsten Kumoll.

Pg. 12</ref> This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.<ref name=\"ZenkerKumoll\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lassiter | first1 = Luke E. | year = 2001 | title = From 'Reading over the Shoulders of Natives' to 'Reading alongside Natives', Literally: Toward a Collaborative and Reciprocal Ethnography | url = | journal =  Journal of Anthropological Research| volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 137\u2013149 | doi=10.1086/jar.57.2.3631564}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lassiter | first1 = Luke E. | year = 2005| title = Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 83\u2013106 | doi=10.1086/425658}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnography And Health Care===\n\nStudies have shown that ethnographies are tied into systems such as Health Care. Ethnographic health care studies have been done when it is necessary to monitor and look at behavior for people with illnesses. In other words, patients tend to rely on this type of research in order to know what specific behavior is correlated to illness. For example, certain types of patients who receive therapy need to be watched closely to see what results may come of the treatment.\n\nEthnography is not just useful when looking at the patients, it is also very helpful to look at the organization of health care. In order to see how the system is executed, their must be studies done on those people who look at their behavior in order to get an idea of how efficient it really is. (Savage, 2000)\n\n===Sociology===\n{{Sociology}}\n[[Sociology]] is another field which prominently features ethnographies. [[Urban sociology]], Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'' (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, ''[[Street Corner Society]]'' by [[William Foote Whyte]] and ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]]. Major influences on this development were anthropologist [[Lloyd Warner]], on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]]'s experience as a journalist. [[Symbolic interactionism]] developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as ''Shared Fantasy'' by [[Gary Alan Fine]], which documents the early history of fantasy [[role-playing games]].  Other important ethnographies in sociology include [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work in Algeria and France.\n\nJaber F. Gubrium's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable.  They include ''Living and Dying at Murray Manor,'' which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; ''Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,'' which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; ''Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,'' which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and ''Oldtimers and Alzheimer's: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,'' which describes how the Alzheimer's disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of [[institutional ethnography]], developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] for studying the social relations which structure people's everyday lives.\n\nOther notable ethnographies include [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]]'s ''Learning to Labour,'' on working class youth; the work of [[Elijah Anderson]], [[Mitchell Duneier]], and [[Lo\u00efc Wacquant]] on black America, and Lai Olurode's ''Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa''.  But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.\n\n=== Communication studies ===\nBeginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as [[Gerry Philipsen|Gerry Philipsen's]] analysis of cultural communication strategies in a [[blue-collar]], working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, ''Speaking 'Like a Man' in Teamsterville'', paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.\n\nScholars of [[communication studies]] use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain \"how\" ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the \"why\" and \"how come\" questions of human communication.<ref>Rubin, R. B., Rubin, A. M., and Piele, L. J. (2005). ''Communication Research: Strategies and Sources.'' Belmont, California: Thomson Wadworth. pp. 229.</ref>  Often this type of research results in a [[case study]] or [[field study]] such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during \"down time\" at a fire station.  Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular [[social group]] being studied.<ref>Bentz, V. M., and Shapiro, J. J. (1998). ''Mindful Inquiry in Social Research.'' Thousand Oaks, California: Sage. pp. 117.</ref>\n\n===Other fields===\nThe American anthropologist [[George Spindler]] was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.\n\nAnthropologists such as [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Mary Douglas]] have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption.  In this sense, Tony Salvador, [[Genevieve Bell]], and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being \"a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers.\"<ref>Salvador, Tony; Genevieve Bell; and Ken Anderson (1999) \"Design Ethnography,\" ''Design Management Journal'' (pp. 35-41). p.37</ref> Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book,<ref>{{cite book|title =Practical Ethnography|first = Sam|last = Ladner|isbn = 978-1611323900|date = 2014-04-15}}</ref> that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in \"standpoint,\" one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers' unmet needs.\n\nBusinesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. By assessing user experience in a \u201cnatural\u201d setting, ethnology yields insights into the practical applications of a product or service. It's one of the best ways to identify areas of friction and improve overall user experience.<ref>A Simple Guide For Conducting Consumer Research by Brian Lischer http://www.ignytebrands.com/customer-research/</ref> Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as [[video ethnography]]). The ''Ethnographic Praxis in Industry'' (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do\u2014avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1115/DETC2016-59832 |isbn=978-0-7918-5019-0 |chapter=Computer-Aided Ethnography in Engineering Design |title=Volume 7: 28th International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology |year=2016 |last1=Dixon |first1=Adam |last2=Liu |first2=Ying |last3=Setchi |first3=Rossi }}</ref>\n\n=== Evaluating ethnography ===\nThe ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as [[positivism]] and [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]]). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner.  No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p.&nbsp;254)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=Laurel |title=Evaluating Ethnography |journal=Qualitative Inquiry |date=29 June 2016 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=253\u2013255 |doi=10.1177/107780040000600207 }}</ref>  provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein's (1997) monograph, ''The New Language of Qualitative Method,'' discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their \"methods talk.\"\n\n# ''Substantive contribution'': \"Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?\"\n# ''Aesthetic merit'': \"Does this piece succeed aesthetically?\"\n# ''Reflexivity'': \"How did the author come to write this text\u2026Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?\"<ref>For post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations, see essays in Prem Poddar et al, ''Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2008.</ref>\n# ''Impact'': \"Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?\"  Does it move me?\n# ''Expresses a reality'': \"Does it seem 'true'\u2014a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the 'real'?\"\n\n==Advantages and challenges==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2015}}\nEthnography, which is a method dedicated entirely to field work, is aimed at gaining a deeper insight of a certain people's knowledge and social culture.\n\nEthnography's advantages are:\n* It can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover.\n* Notions that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted.\n* It enables the researcher to observe behaviors that are impossible to detect in other forms of in-person qualitative research e.g. IDIs or Focus Groups\n* It immerses the researcher in the everyday context of the research participant\n* It can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding of and interpretations of (by the ethnographer) the accounts of informants (those who are being studied), which goes far beyond what quantitative research can do in terms of extracting meanings.\n* Ethnography allows people outside of a culture (whether of a primitive tribe or of a corporation's employees) to learn about its members' practices, motives, understandings, and values.\n\nHowever, there are certain challenges or limitations for the ethnographic method: \n* Deep expertise is required: Ethnographers must accumulate knowledge about the methods and domains of interest, which can take considerable training and time.\n* Sensitivity: The ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming those being observed.\n* Access: Negotiating access to field sites and participants can be time-consuming and difficult. Secretive or guarded organizations may require different approaches in order for researchers to succeed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Monahan |first1=Torin |last2=Fisher |first2=Jill A. |title=Strategies for Obtaining Access to Secretive or Guarded Organizations |journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography |date=26 September 2014 |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=709\u2013736 |doi=10.1177/0891241614549834 |pmid=26688613 |pmc=4679148 }}</ref>\n* Duration and cost: Research can involve prolonged time in the field, particularly because building trust with participants is usually necessary for obtaining rich data. This level of cost means traditional in-person Ethnography is within the budgets of very few brands. \n* Bias: Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis.\n* Descriptive approach:  Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of critical incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by those used to the scientific approaches of hypothesis testing, quantification and replication.\n* The 'Researcher Effect': the risk that participants will change their behaviors because of the presence of the researcher.\n\nAmong the dangers of ethnography are that it can become indistinguishable from a kind of [[embedded journalism]] or [[blog]] with academic jargon giving it the veneer of academic legitimacy but without actually meeting the classic requirements for ethnography.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Brooks |title=Post\u2013Cold War Anthropology as Ideological Blog |journal=Journal of Developing Societies |date=30 January 2013 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201387 |doi=10.1177/0169796X12470555 }}</ref> A series of tests can be applied to determine whether work is actually ethnography or academic journalism depending on the focus of the study (an \"ethnos\"), the scientific hypotheses and questions, whether there is model building, whether there are cross-cultural comparisons, and the purpose, uses and forms of the work.\n\n==Ethics==\n[[Gary Alan Fine]] argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist [[epistemology|epistemologies]] that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be \u2014 and that \"each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know\".<ref>Fine, p. 267</ref>\n\nFine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that \"illusions\" are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, \"Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold\".<ref>Fine, p. 291</ref> Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: \"Classic Virtues\", \"Technical Skills\", and \"Ethnographic Self\".\n\nMuch debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer [[Napoleon Chagnon]] conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the [[Yanomani]] people of South America.\n\nWhile there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work.<ref name = \"Ethics p.1\">''American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics'' http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf, p.1</ref> In 2009 the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have \"moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession\".<ref name=\"Ethics p.1\"/> The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully.<ref name=\"Ethics p.1\"/> The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work.<ref name=\"Ethics p.1\"/> The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well.<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2</ref>  The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1-8</ref>\n\n* \"Conducting Research\" - When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study.<ref name=\"Ethics p.2-3\">American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2-3</ref>  If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.<ref name=\"Ethics p.2-3\"/>\n* \"Teaching\" - When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.4</ref>\n* \"Application\" - When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be \"open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work.\"<ref name=\"Ethics p.5\">American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5</ref>\n* \"Dissemination of Results\" - When disseminating results of an ethnography, \"[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved.\"<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5-6</ref>  Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.<ref name=\"Ethics p.5\"/>\n\n===Classic virtues===\n* \"The kindly ethnographer\" \u2013 Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from who we are in other circumstances.\n* \"The friendly ethnographer\" \u2013 Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.<ref name=\"Fine\">Fine, p. 270-77</ref>\n* \"The honest ethnographer\" \u2013 If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.<ref name=\"Fine\" />\n\n===Technical skills===\n* \"The Precise Ethnographer\" \u2013 Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what \"really\" happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.\n* \"The Observant Ethnographer\" \u2013 Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete \u2013 that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers' skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.\n* \"The Unobtrusive Ethnographer\" \u2013 As a \"participant\" in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an \"active member\" affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.<ref>Fine, p. 277-81</ref>\n\n===Ethnographic self===\nThe following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:\n\n* \"The Candid Ethnographer\" \u2013 Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.\n* \"The Chaste Ethnographer\" \u2013 When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.\n* \"The Fair Ethnographer\" \u2013 Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.\n* \"The Literary Ethnographer\" \u2013 Representation is a balancing act of determining what to \"show\" through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to \"tell\" via straightforward, 'factual' reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.<ref name=\"Fine, p. 282-89\">Fine, p. 282-89</ref>\n\nAccording to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following seven principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:\n\n# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.\n# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.\n# Link the group's symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.\n# Record all behavior.\n# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.\n# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.\n# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.\n\n==Notable ethnographers==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Manuel Anc\u00edzar Basterra]] (1812-1882)\n* [[Franz Boas]] (1858\u20131942)\n* [[Gregory Bateson]] (1904\u20131980)\n* [[Adriaen Cornelissen van der Donck]] (c. 1618 \u2013 1655)\n* [[Mary Douglas]] (1921\u20132007) \n* [[Raymond Firth]] (1901\u20132002) \n* [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914-2002)\n* [[Diamond Jenness]] (1886-1969)\n* [[Mary Kingsley]] (1862\u20131900)\n* [[Carobeth Laird]] (1895-1983) \n* [[Ruth Landes]] (1908-1991)\n* [[Edmund Leach]] (1910-1989)\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Leite de Vasconcelos]] (1858-1941)\n* [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] (1908-2009)\n* [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] (1884-1942)\n* [[David Maybury-Lewis]] (1929-2007)\n* [[Margaret Mead]] (1901\u20131978)\n* [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]] (1846-1888)\n* [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller]] (1705-1783) \n* [[Nikolai Nadezhdin]] (1804-1856)\n* [[Lubor Niederle]] (1865-1944)\n* [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] (1739-1811)\n* [[Alexey Okladnikov]] (1908-1981)\n* [[Sergey Oldenburg]] (1863-1934)\n* [[Edward Sapir]] (1884\u20131939)\n* [[August Ludwig von Schl\u00f6zer]] (1735-1809)\n* [[James Spradley]] (1933-1982)\n* [[Jean Briggs]] (1929-2016)\n* [[Cora Du Bois]] (1903-1991)\n* [[Lila Abu-Lughod]]\n* [[Elijah Anderson]] (born 1943) \n* [[Ruth Behar]]\n* [[Zuzana Be\u0148u\u0161kov\u00e1]] (born 1960)\n* [[Zalpa Bersanova]]\n* [[Napoleon Chagnon]] (born 1938)\n* [[Veena Das]] (born 1945)\n* [[Kristen R.

Examples of societal subgroups that ethnologists study are [[gang]]s, organizations, communities, or [[cult]]s.\n\nEthnography entails examining the behaviour of the participants in a given social situation and also understanding group members' own interpretation of such behaviour.<ref name=\"auto\">(Dewan M.

An ethnography records all observed behavior and describes all symbol-meaning relations, using concepts that avoid causal explanations. Traditionally, ethnography was focussed on the western gaze towards the far 'exotic' east, but now researchers are undertaking ethnography in their own social environment. According to Dewan (2018), even if we are the other, the \u2018another\u2019 or the \u2018native\u2019, we are still \u2018another\u2019 because there are many facades of ourselves that connect us to people and other facades that highlight our differences.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==History and meaning==\n[[File:Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan (2).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] is known as the first modern ethnographer<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist (review)|first=Louise M.|last=Burkhart|date=10 June 2003|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=89|issue=2|pages=351\u2013352|doi=10.1353/cat.2003.0100}}</ref>]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2015}}\nThe word 'ethnography' is derived from the Greek \u1f14\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''ethnos''), meaning \"a company, later a people, nation\" and [[-graphy]], meaning \"writing\".

(2015). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (4th edition). Wiley.</ref>\n\nThe field of anthropology originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.&nbsp;B. Tylor]] (1832\u20131917) from Britain and [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818\u20131881), an American scientist, were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. [[Franz Boas]] (1858\u20131942), [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] (1884\u20141942), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887\u20131948), and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901\u20131978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of [[cultural relativism]] to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and this became the origin of field work and field methods.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller]] developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733\u201343) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated ''V\u00f6lker-Beschreibung'' as a distinct area of study. This became known as \"ethnography,\" following the introduction of the Greek neologism ''ethnographia''  by Johann Friedrich Sch\u00f6pperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[August Ludwig von Schl\u00f6zer]] and [[Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer]] of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.<ref name=\":0\">Vermeulen, Han F., 2008, ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment'', Leiden, p. 199.</ref><ref name=\"Vermeulen\">{{cite book|last = Vermeulen|first = Hans|title = Early History of Ethnograph and Ethnolog in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710-1808|year = 2008|publisher = Privately published|location = Leiden}}</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]], known as the Father of History, had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the Hellenic realm such as the [[Scythians]], which earned him the title \"philobarbarian\", and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography.\n\n==Forms==\n\nThere are different forms of ethnography: confessional ethnography; life history; feminist ethnography etc. Two popular forms of ethnography are realist ethnography and critical ethnography. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)\n\nRealist ethnography is a traditional approach used by cultural anthropologists. Characterized by Van Maanen (1988), it reflects a particular instance taken by the researcher toward the individual being studied. It's an objective study of the situation. It's composed from a third person's perspective by getting the data from the members on the site. The ethnographer stays as omniscient correspondent of actualities out of sight. The realist reports information in a measured style ostensibly uncontaminated by individual predisposition, political objectives, and judgment. The analyst will give a detailed report of the everyday life of the individuals under study. The ethnographer also uses standard categories for cultural description (e.g., family life, communication network). The ethnographer produces the participant's views through closely edited quotations and has the final word on how the culture is to be interpreted and presented. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)\n\nCritical ethnography is a kind of ethnographic research in which the creators advocate for the liberation of groups which are marginalized in society. Critical researchers typically are politically minded people who look to take a stand of opposition to inequality and domination.  For example, a critical ethnographer might study schools that provide privileges to certain types of students, or counseling practices that serve to overlook the needs of underrepresented groups. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94). The important components of a critical ethnographer are to incorporate a value-laden introduction, empower people by giving them more authority, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control. A critical ethnographer will study issues of power, empowerment, inequality, inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony, and victimization. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)\n\n<big>'''Digital Ethnography'''</big>\n\nDigital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography. This type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil. Digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies. Traditional ethnography may used for\u00a0 videos or images, but digital ethnography goes more in depth. For example, digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as Twitter or blogs so that people's interactions and behaviors can be studied.\n\n<big>'''Relational Ethnography'''</big>\n\nMost ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved. Relational Ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people. Meaning that relational ethnography doesn't take an object nor a bounded group that is defined by its members shared social features nor a specific location that is delimited by the boundaries of a particular area. But rather the processes involving configurations of relations among different agents or institutions.\n\n==Features of ethnographic research==\nAccording to Dewan (2018), the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions.<ref>(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An \u2018Exotic\u2019 Ethnographer\u2019s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore).</ref>\n\n* Involves investigation of very few cases, maybe just one case, in detail.\n* Often involves working with primarily unconstructed data. This data had not been coded at the point of data collection in terms of a closed set of analytic categories.\n* Emphasizes on exploring social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses.\n* Data analysis involves interpretation of the functions and meanings of human actions. The product of this is mainly verbal explanations, where statistical analysis and quantification play a subordinate role. \n* Methodological discussions focus more on questions about how to report findings in the field than on methods of data collection and interpretation.\n* Ethnographies focus on describing the culture of a group in very detailed and complex manner. The ethnography can be of the entire group or a subpart of it. \n* It involves engaging in extensive field work where data collection is mainly by interviews, symbols, artifacts, observations, and many other sources of data. \n* The researcher in ethnography type of research looks for patterns of the group's mental activities, that is their ideas and beliefs expressed through language or other activities, and how they behave in their groups as expressed through their actions that the researcher observed.\n* In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Procedures for conducting ethnography==\n\n* Determine if ethnography is the most appropriate design to use to study the research problem. Ethnography is suitable if the needs are to describe how a cultural group works and to explore their beliefs, language, behaviours and also issues faced by the group, such as power, resistance, and dominance. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)\n*  Then identify and locate a culture-sharing group to study.  This group is one whose members have been together for an extended period of time, so that their shared language, patterns of behaviour and attitudes have merged into discernible patterns. This group can also be a group that has been marginalized by society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)\n* Select cultural themes, issues or theories to study about the group. These themes, issues, and theories provide an orienting framework for the study of the culture-sharing group. As discussed by [[Martyn Hammersley|Hammersley]] and Atkinson (2007), Wolcott (1987, 1994b, 2008-1), and Fetterman (2009). The ethnographer begins the study by examining people in interaction in ordinary settings and discerns pervasive patterns such as life cycles, events, and cultural themes. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94-95)\n* For studying cultural concepts, determine which type of ethnography to use. Perhaps how the group works need to be described, or a critical ethnography can expose issues such as power, hegemony, and advocacy for certain groups (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)\n* Should collect information in the context or setting where the group works or lives. This is called fieldwork. Types of information typically needed in ethnography are collected by going to the research site, respecting the daily lives of individuals at the site and collecting a wide variety of materials. Field issues of respect, reciprocity, deciding who owns the data and others are central to Ethnography (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)\n*  From the many sources collected, the ethnographer analyzes the data for a description of the culture-sharing group, themes that emerge from the group and an overall interpretation (Wolcott, 1994b). The researcher begins to compile a detailed description of the culture-sharing group, by focusing on a single event, on several activities, or on the group over a prolonged period of time.\n*   Forge a working set of rules or generalizations as to how the culture-sharing group works as the final product of this analysis. The final product is a holistic cultural portrait of the group that incorporates the views of the participants (emic) as well as the views of the researcher (etic). It might also advocate for the needs of the group or suggest changes in society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 96)\n\n==As method==\nThe ethnographic method is different from other ways of conducting social science approach due to the following reasons:\n[[File:Rozmowa z tw\u00f3rczyniami tradycyjnych, wo\u0142oskich pisanek.jpg|thumb|An ethnographer conducting field interviews, [[Wallachian Open Air Museum|Vala\u0161sk\u00e9 muzeum v p\u0159\u00edrod\u011b]]]]\n* It is field-based. It is conducted in the settings in which real people actually live, rather than in laboratories where the researcher controls the elements of the behaviors to be observed or measured.\n* It is personalized. It is conducted by researchers who are in the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the people they are studying and who are thus both participants in and observers of the lives under study.\n* It is multifactorial. It is conducted through the use of two or more data collection techniques - which may be qualitative or quantitative in nature - in order to get a conclusion.\n* It requires a long-term commitment i.e. it is conducted by a researcher who intends to interact with people they are studying for an extended period of time.  The exact time frame can vary from several weeks to a year or more.\n* It is inductive. It is conducted in such a way to use an accumulation of descriptive detail to build toward general patterns or explanatory theories rather than structured to test hypotheses derived from existing theories or models.\n* It is dialogic.  It is conducted by a researcher whose interpretations and findings may be expounded on by the study's participants while conclusions are still in the process of formulation.\n* It is holistic. It is conducted so as to yield the fullest possible portrait of the group under study.\n* It can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Data collection methods==\n[[File:Izmir Ethnography Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Izmir Ethnography Museum]] (\u0130zmir Etnografya M\u00fczesi), [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]], from the courtyard]]\n[[File:Ethnography Museum Budapest architecture.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnography museum]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]\nAccording to [[John David Brewer|John Brewer]], a leading social scientist, data collection methods are meant to capture the \"social meanings and ordinary activities\"<ref name=\"brewer\">[Brewer, John D. (2000). ''Ethnography.'' Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.10.]</ref> of people (informants) in \"naturally occurring settings\"<ref name=\"brewer\" /> that are commonly referred to as \"the field.\"  The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data.<ref name=\"brewer\" />  Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community.  These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews, and surveys.\n\nInterviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic.  In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to \"discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies\".<ref>[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/kinship.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.\n\nIn order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be \"reflexive\". Reflexivity refers to the researcher's aim \"to explore the ways in which [the] researcher's involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research\".<ref>[Nightingale, David & Cromby, John. ''Social Constructionist Psychology: A Critical Analysis of Theory and Practice''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.228.]</ref>  Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.\n\nTraditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well.<ref name=\"G1\">{{cite book |last=Garson |first=G. David |url=http://www.statisticalassociates.com/ethnography.htm |title=Ethnographic Research |year=2015 }}{{page needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling.<ref name=\"G1\"/> This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied.<ref name=\"G1\"/> Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience.

(2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography.  Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing \"the interplay of individual agency and social structure.\"<ref>S. Ybema, D. Yanow, H. Wels, & F. Kamsteeg (2010). \"Ethnography.\" In A. Mills, G. Durepos, & E. Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.'' (pp. 348-352). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.</ref> Critical theory researchers address \"issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power.\"\n\nAnother form of data collection is that of the \"image.\" The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual's perspective, primarily based on that individual's past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of \"I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Lynda|title=Lynda Barry: The answer is in the picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmT4wLWksOw|website=YouTube|publisher=INKtalks|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.\n\n== Differences across disciplines ==\nThe ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists but also occasionally by sociologists.

E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''Naven'' (1936, 1958) by [[Gregory Bateson]], or \"[[The Lele of the Kasai]]\" (1963) by [[Mary Douglas]]. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on [[emic]] views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common.<ref>Naroll, Raoul. ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology.''</ref>  Ethnographies are also sometimes called \"case studies.\"<ref>Chavez, Leo. ''Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Workers in American Society'' (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology). 1997, Prentice Hall.</ref>  Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on [[fieldwork]]. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life. Ruth Fulton Benedict uses examples of Enthrotyhy in her serious of field work that began in 1922 of Serrano, of the Zuni in 1924, the Cochiti in 1925 and the Pina in 1926. All being people she wished to study for her anthropological data. Benedict's experiences with the Southwest Zuni pueblo is to be considered the basis of her formative fieldwork. The experience set the idea for her to produce her theory of \u201cculture is personality writ large\u201d (modell, 1988). By studying the culture between the different Pueblo and Plain Indians, She discovered the culture isomorphism that would be considered her personalized unique approach to the study of anthropology using ethnographic techniques.\n\n[[File:Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski among Trobriand tribe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] among [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand]] tribe]]\n[[File:No\u0107 muzeja 2014, \u010cakovec - poljoprivredni izlo\u0161ci.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the ethnographic collection of the [[Me\u0111imurje County Museum]] in [[Croatia]]]]\nA typical ethnography attempts to be [[holistic]]<ref name=\"Ember 2006\"/><ref name=\"Heider, Karl 2001\"/> and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the [[physical geography]] or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including [[climate]], and often including what biological anthropologists call [[habitat]]. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure.  Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics.<ref>cf.

In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a [[Empirical research|phenomenological]] approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about \"webs\" instead of \"outlines\"<ref>Geertz, Clifford. ''The Interpretation of Culture,'' Chapter one.</ref> of culture.\n\nWithin cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography.  Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing \"bio-confessional\" ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research.  Famous examples include ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]'' (1955) by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, ''The High Valley'' by Kenneth Read, and ''The Savage and the Innocent'' by [[David Maybury-Lewis]], as well as the mildly fictionalized ''Return to Laughter'' by Elenore Smith Bowen ([[Laura Bohannan]]).\n\nLater \"[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]\" ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer.  Famous examples include ''Deep Play:  Notes on a Balinese Cockfight'' by [[Clifford Geertz]],  ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' by [[Paul Rabinow]], ''The Headman and I'' by Jean-Paul Dumont, and ''Tuhami'' by Vincent Crapanzano.  In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of [[literary theory]] and [[postcolonial|post-colonial]]/[[post-structuralist]] thought.  \"Experimental\" ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include ''Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man'' by [[Michael Taussig]], ''Debating Muslims'' by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, ''A Space on the Side of the Road'' by Kathleen Stewart, and ''Advocacy after Bhopal'' by Kim Fortun.\n\nThis critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, ''Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'', (1986) edited by [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]. ''Writing Culture'' helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern,' 'reflexive,' 'literary,' 'deconstructive,' or 'poststructural' in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.<ref>Olaf Zenker & Karsten Kumoll. ''Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices.'' (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pgs. 1-4</ref>\n\nWhere Geertz's and [[Victor Turner|Turner's]] interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible.<ref>Paul A. Erickson & Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory,'' Third Edition. (2008). Toronto: Broadview Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-871-0}}. Pg. 190</ref> In regards to this last point, ''Writing Culture'' became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority.<ref>Erickson & Murphy (2008). A History of Anthropological Theory, Pgs. 190-191</ref> Along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology,' 'narrative ethnography,'<ref>{{cite web |first1=Kristen |last1=Ghodsee |title=Writing Ethnographies that Ordinary People Can Read |work=Anthropology News |date=May 24, 2013 |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/writing_ethnographies.pdf }}</ref> and 'literary ethnography',<ref>Literary Ethnography http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/</ref> ''Writing Culture'' helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography.'<ref name=\"ZenkerKumoll\">Olaf Zenker & Karsten Kumoll.

Pg. 12</ref> This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.<ref name=\"ZenkerKumoll\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lassiter | first1 = Luke E. | year = 2001 | title = From 'Reading over the Shoulders of Natives' to 'Reading alongside Natives', Literally: Toward a Collaborative and Reciprocal Ethnography | url = | journal =  Journal of Anthropological Research| volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 137\u2013149 | doi=10.1086/jar.57.2.3631564}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lassiter | first1 = Luke E. | year = 2005| title = Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 83\u2013106 | doi=10.1086/425658}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnography And Health Care===\n\nStudies have shown that ethnographies are tied into systems such as Health Care. Ethnographic health care studies have been done when it is necessary to monitor and look at behavior for people with illnesses. In other words, patients tend to rely on this type of research in order to know what specific behavior is correlated to illness. For example, certain types of patients who receive therapy need to be watched closely to see what results may come of the treatment.\n\nEthnography is not just useful when looking at the patients, it is also very helpful to look at the organization of health care. In order to see how the system is executed, their must be studies done on those people who look at their behavior in order to get an idea of how efficient it really is. (Savage, 2000)\n\n===Sociology===\n{{Sociology}}\n[[Sociology]] is another field which prominently features ethnographies. [[Urban sociology]], Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'' (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, ''[[Street Corner Society]]'' by [[William Foote Whyte]] and ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]]. Major influences on this development were anthropologist [[Lloyd Warner]], on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]]'s experience as a journalist. [[Symbolic interactionism]] developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as ''Shared Fantasy'' by [[Gary Alan Fine]], which documents the early history of fantasy [[role-playing games]].  Other important ethnographies in sociology include [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work in Algeria and France.\n\nJaber F. Gubrium's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable.  They include ''Living and Dying at Murray Manor,'' which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; ''Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,'' which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; ''Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,'' which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and ''Oldtimers and Alzheimer's: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,'' which describes how the Alzheimer's disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of [[institutional ethnography]], developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] for studying the social relations which structure people's everyday lives.\n\nOther notable ethnographies include [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]]'s ''Learning to Labour,'' on working class youth; the work of [[Elijah Anderson]], [[Mitchell Duneier]], and [[Lo\u00efc Wacquant]] on black America, and Lai Olurode's ''Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa''.  But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.\n\n=== Communication studies ===\nBeginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as [[Gerry Philipsen|Gerry Philipsen's]] analysis of cultural communication strategies in a [[blue-collar]], working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, ''Speaking 'Like a Man' in Teamsterville'', paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.\n\nScholars of [[communication studies]] use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain \"how\" ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the \"why\" and \"how come\" questions of human communication.<ref>Rubin, R. B., Rubin, A. M., and Piele, L. J. (2005). ''Communication Research: Strategies and Sources.'' Belmont, California: Thomson Wadworth. pp. 229.</ref>  Often this type of research results in a [[case study]] or [[field study]] such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during \"down time\" at a fire station.  Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular [[social group]] being studied.<ref>Bentz, V. M., and Shapiro, J. J. (1998). ''Mindful Inquiry in Social Research.'' Thousand Oaks, California: Sage. pp. 117.</ref>\n\n===Other fields===\nThe American anthropologist [[George Spindler]] was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.\n\nAnthropologists such as [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Mary Douglas]] have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption.  In this sense, Tony Salvador, [[Genevieve Bell]], and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being \"a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers.\"<ref>Salvador, Tony; Genevieve Bell; and Ken Anderson (1999) \"Design Ethnography,\" ''Design Management Journal'' (pp. 35-41). p.37</ref> Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book,<ref>{{cite book|title =Practical Ethnography|first = Sam|last = Ladner|isbn = 978-1611323900|date = 2014-04-15}}</ref> that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in \"standpoint,\" one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers' unmet needs.\n\nBusinesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. By assessing user experience in a \u201cnatural\u201d setting, ethnology yields insights into the practical applications of a product or service. It's one of the best ways to identify areas of friction and improve overall user experience.<ref>A Simple Guide For Conducting Consumer Research by Brian Lischer http://www.ignytebrands.com/customer-research/</ref> Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as [[video ethnography]]). The ''Ethnographic Praxis in Industry'' (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do\u2014avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1115/DETC2016-59832 |isbn=978-0-7918-5019-0 |chapter=Computer-Aided Ethnography in Engineering Design |title=Volume 7: 28th International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology |year=2016 |last1=Dixon |first1=Adam |last2=Liu |first2=Ying |last3=Setchi |first3=Rossi }}</ref>\n\n=== Evaluating ethnography ===\nThe ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as [[positivism]] and [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]]). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner.  No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p.&nbsp;254)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=Laurel |title=Evaluating Ethnography |journal=Qualitative Inquiry |date=29 June 2016 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=253\u2013255 |doi=10.1177/107780040000600207 }}</ref>  provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein's (1997) monograph, ''The New Language of Qualitative Method,'' discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their \"methods talk.\"\n\n# ''Substantive contribution'': \"Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?\"\n# ''Aesthetic merit'': \"Does this piece succeed aesthetically?\"\n# ''Reflexivity'': \"How did the author come to write this text\u2026Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?\"<ref>For post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations, see essays in Prem Poddar et al, ''Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2008.</ref>\n# ''Impact'': \"Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?\"  Does it move me?\n# ''Expresses a reality'': \"Does it seem 'true'\u2014a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the 'real'?\"\n\n==Advantages and challenges==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2015}}\nEthnography, which is a method dedicated entirely to field work, is aimed at gaining a deeper insight of a certain people's knowledge and social culture.\n\nEthnography's advantages are:\n* It can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover.\n* Notions that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted.\n* It enables the researcher to observe behaviors that are impossible to detect in other forms of in-person qualitative research e.g. IDIs or Focus Groups\n* It immerses the researcher in the everyday context of the research participant\n* It can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding of and interpretations of (by the ethnographer) the accounts of informants (those who are being studied), which goes far beyond what quantitative research can do in terms of extracting meanings.\n* Ethnography allows people outside of a culture (whether of a primitive tribe or of a corporation's employees) to learn about its members' practices, motives, understandings, and values.\n\nHowever, there are certain challenges or limitations for the ethnographic method: \n* Deep expertise is required: Ethnographers must accumulate knowledge about the methods and domains of interest, which can take considerable training and time.\n* Sensitivity: The ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming those being observed.\n* Access: Negotiating access to field sites and participants can be time-consuming and difficult. Secretive or guarded organizations may require different approaches in order for researchers to succeed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Monahan |first1=Torin |last2=Fisher |first2=Jill A. |title=Strategies for Obtaining Access to Secretive or Guarded Organizations |journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography |date=26 September 2014 |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=709\u2013736 |doi=10.1177/0891241614549834 |pmid=26688613 |pmc=4679148 }}</ref>\n* Duration and cost: Research can involve prolonged time in the field, particularly because building trust with participants is usually necessary for obtaining rich data. This level of cost means traditional in-person Ethnography is within the budgets of very few brands. \n* Bias: Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis.\n* Descriptive approach:  Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of critical incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by those used to the scientific approaches of hypothesis testing, quantification and replication.\n* The 'Researcher Effect': the risk that participants will change their behaviors because of the presence of the researcher.\n\nAmong the dangers of ethnography are that it can become indistinguishable from a kind of [[embedded journalism]] or [[blog]] with academic jargon giving it the veneer of academic legitimacy but without actually meeting the classic requirements for ethnography.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Brooks |title=Post\u2013Cold War Anthropology as Ideological Blog |journal=Journal of Developing Societies |date=30 January 2013 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201387 |doi=10.1177/0169796X12470555 }}</ref> A series of tests can be applied to determine whether work is actually ethnography or academic journalism depending on the focus of the study (an \"ethnos\"), the scientific hypotheses and questions, whether there is model building, whether there are cross-cultural comparisons, and the purpose, uses and forms of the work.\n\n==Ethics==\n[[Gary Alan Fine]] argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist [[epistemology|epistemologies]] that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be \u2014 and that \"each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know\".<ref>Fine, p. 267</ref>\n\nFine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that \"illusions\" are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, \"Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold\".<ref>Fine, p. 291</ref> Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: \"Classic Virtues\", \"Technical Skills\", and \"Ethnographic Self\".\n\nMuch debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer [[Napoleon Chagnon]] conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the [[Yanomani]] people of South America.\n\nWhile there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work.<ref name = \"Ethics p.1\">''American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics'' http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf, p.1</ref> In 2009 the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have \"moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession\".<ref name=\"Ethics p.1\"/> The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully.<ref name=\"Ethics p.1\"/> The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work.<ref name=\"Ethics p.1\"/> The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well.<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2</ref>  The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1-8</ref>\n\n* \"Conducting Research\" - When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study.<ref name=\"Ethics p.2-3\">American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2-3</ref>  If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.<ref name=\"Ethics p.2-3\"/>\n* \"Teaching\" - When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.4</ref>\n* \"Application\" - When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be \"open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work.\"<ref name=\"Ethics p.5\">American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5</ref>\n* \"Dissemination of Results\" - When disseminating results of an ethnography, \"[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved.\"<ref>American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5-6</ref>  Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.<ref name=\"Ethics p.5\"/>\n\n===Classic virtues===\n* \"The kindly ethnographer\" \u2013 Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from who we are in other circumstances.\n* \"The friendly ethnographer\" \u2013 Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.<ref name=\"Fine\">Fine, p. 270-77</ref>\n* \"The honest ethnographer\" \u2013 If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.<ref name=\"Fine\" />\n\n===Technical skills===\n* \"The Precise Ethnographer\" \u2013 Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what \"really\" happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.\n* \"The Observant Ethnographer\" \u2013 Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete \u2013 that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers' skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.\n* \"The Unobtrusive Ethnographer\" \u2013 As a \"participant\" in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an \"active member\" affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.<ref>Fine, p. 277-81</ref>\n\n===Ethnographic self===\nThe following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:\n\n* \"The Candid Ethnographer\" \u2013 Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.\n* \"The Chaste Ethnographer\" \u2013 When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.\n* \"The Fair Ethnographer\" \u2013 Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.\n* \"The Literary Ethnographer\" \u2013 Representation is a balancing act of determining what to \"show\" through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to \"tell\" via straightforward, 'factual' reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.<ref name=\"Fine, p. 282-89\">Fine, p. 282-89</ref>\n\nAccording to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following seven principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:\n\n# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.\n# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.\n# Link the group's symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.\n# Record all behavior.\n# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.\n# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.\n# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.\n\n==Notable ethnographers==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Manuel Anc\u00edzar Basterra]] (1812-1882)\n* [[Franz Boas]] (1858\u20131942)\n* [[Gregory Bateson]] (1904\u20131980)\n* [[Adriaen Cornelissen van der Donck]] (c. 1618 \u2013 1655)\n* [[Mary Douglas]] (1921\u20132007) \n* [[Raymond Firth]] (1901\u20132002) \n* [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914-2002)\n* [[Diamond Jenness]] (1886-1969)\n* [[Mary Kingsley]] (1862\u20131900)\n* [[Carobeth Laird]] (1895-1983) \n* [[Ruth Landes]] (1908-1991)\n* [[Edmund Leach]] (1910-1989)\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Leite de Vasconcelos]] (1858-1941)\n* [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] (1908-2009)\n* [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] (1884-1942)\n* [[David Maybury-Lewis]] (1929-2007)\n* [[Margaret Mead]] (1901\u20131978)\n* [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]] (1846-1888)\n* [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller]] (1705-1783) \n* [[Nikolai Nadezhdin]] (1804-1856)\n* [[Lubor Niederle]] (1865-1944)\n* [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] (1739-1811)\n* [[Alexey Okladnikov]] (1908-1981)\n* [[Sergey Oldenburg]] (1863-1934)\n* [[Edward Sapir]] (1884\u20131939)\n* [[August Ludwig von Schl\u00f6zer]] (1735-1809)\n* [[James Spradley]] (1933-1982)\n* [[Jean Briggs]] (1929-2016)\n* [[Cora Du Bois]] (1903-1991)\n* [[Lila Abu-Lughod]]\n* [[Elijah Anderson]] (born 1943) \n* [[Ruth Behar]]\n* [[Zuzana Be\u0148u\u0161kov\u00e1]] (born 1960)\n* [[Zalpa Bersanova]]\n* [[Napoleon Chagnon]] (born 1938)\n* [[Veena Das]] (born 1945)\n* [[Kristen R.

In 1603 he was also appointed to the [[Privy Council of England]], and on 1 June that year received a grant as [[Keeper of the Great Wardrobe]] for life.

On 12 December a [[charter|Royal Charter]] gave him the custody and captaincy of the Castle of [[St Andrews]]. In July 1605 he had a confirmation of all the lands previously granted to him incorporated and combined into a free earldom, Lordship of Parliament, and Barony of Dunbar.\n\n==Religious affairs==\nIn 1608, Home journeyed to [[Scotland]] with [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]] to arrange to promote the Episcopal Church, and to seek some sort of union between the [[Church of England]] and [[Church of Scotland]]. [[James I of England|King James]] was pleased with the initial results, although the hoped-for Union never occurred and the gulf between the King and the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] widened. In July 1605 some nineteen ministers assembled at [[Aberdeen]] in defiance of the King's prohibition against the General Assembly meeting. Six of them were subsequently imprisoned in [[Blackness Castle]] near [[Linlithgow]], and there, on 10 January 1606, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to be present at their trial and to act as the assessor. Everything was done that could be done by him to win a verdict for the King against the six ministers and it is said that he \"brought plenty of money with him to purchase a verdict\". In addition, the Earl himself selected the 15 jurymen, five of whom were Homes, his relatives. But even then the jury could not agree. In the end it was a majority verdict of nine against six in favour of the guilty verdict. Regardless of the irregularities, the verdict stood, and established the law that it was [[High Treason]] for any minister of the Established Church to dispute the authority of the King and the [[Privy Council]] in religious matters.\n\n==Family==\nHe married, around 1590, Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon of [[Gight]]<ref>Some sources call this laird of Gight \"George Gordon\", see Duncan Forbes,''Ane account of the familie of Innes'' (Aberdeen, 1864), p. 248.</ref> and Agnes Beaton, daughter of Cardinal [[David Beaton]], [[Archbishop of St. Andrews]], and [[Marion Ogilvy]]. Their children were:\n\n*Anne Home (d. 1621), who married Sir James Home of Whitrig (d. between 1614\u20131620). Their son became [[James Home, 3rd Earl of Home]].\n*Elizabeth Home, who married [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]].\n\nThe [[Earl of Dunbar]] died in Whitehall, London, in 1611, without male issue, whereupon the earldom and the barony became dormant.\n\nHis body was embalmed, but his funeral service did not take place in Westminster until April, after which his body was placed in a lead coffin and sent to Scotland where it was buried under the floor of [[Dunbar Collegiate Church|Dunbar parish church]], midway between the font and the pulpit. A magnificent monument, said to be finer than any in [[Westminster Abbey]], was erected in his honour, which is still the distinguishing feature of the interior of this church.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Jesus Hospital]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''George Home, Earl of Dunbar'', three lectures by the Reverend J Kirk, MC, CF, (Minister of Dunbar Parish Church 1913-1918), Edinburgh, 1918.\n*''MSS of Colonel Mordaunt-Hay of Duns Castle'', [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], collection no.5, 1909, page 66, number 180.

Willoughby ed., ''Joseph Quincy Adams Memorial Studies'' (FSL, Washington, 1948), pp. 785-801, p. 794 noted only: Lawrence Stone, ''The Crisis of the Aristocracy'' (Oxford, 1965), p. 563 fn. 2</ref> A similar story was recorded by [[Symonds D'Ewes]] on 21 January 1620, that King James had given the late queen's wardrobe to the Earl of Dunbar, who had exported it to the Low Countries and sold it for \u00a3100,000.<ref>[[Janet Arnold]], ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'' (London, 1988), p. 174: Maria Hayward, ''Stuart Style'' (Yale, 2020), p. 55.</ref>\n\n==Landed interests==\nOf these, on the 27 September 1603 Home received the manor and castle of [[Norham]], with its fishing rights on the [[River Tweed]]. On 12 December a [[charter|Royal Charter]] gave him the custody and captaincy of the Castle of [[St Andrews]]. In July 1605 he had a confirmation of all the lands previously granted to him incorporated and combined into a free earldom, Lordship of Parliament, and Barony of Dunbar.\n\n==Religious affairs==\nIn 1608, Home journeyed to [[Scotland]] with [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]] to arrange to promote the Episcopal Church, and to seek some sort of union between the [[Church of England]] and [[Church of Scotland]]. [[James I of England|King James]] was pleased with the initial results, although the hoped-for Union never occurred and the gulf between the King and the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] widened. In July 1605 some nineteen ministers assembled at [[Aberdeen]] in defiance of the King's prohibition against the General Assembly meeting. Six of them were subsequently imprisoned in [[Blackness Castle]] near [[Linlithgow]], and there, on 10 January 1606, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to be present at their trial and to act as the assessor. Everything was done that could be done by him to win a verdict for the King against the six ministers and it is said that he \"brought plenty of money with him to purchase a verdict\". In addition, the Earl himself selected the 15 jurymen, five of whom were Homes, his relatives. But even then the jury could not agree. In the end it was a majority verdict of nine against six in favour of the guilty verdict. Regardless of the irregularities, the verdict stood, and established the law that it was [[High Treason]] for any minister of the Established Church to dispute the authority of the King and the [[Privy Council]] in religious matters.\n\n==Family==\nHe married, around 1590, Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon of [[Gight]]<ref>Some sources call this laird of Gight \"George Gordon\", see Duncan Forbes,''Ane account of the familie of Innes'' (Aberdeen, 1864), p. 248.</ref> and Agnes Beaton, daughter of Cardinal [[David Beaton]], [[Archbishop of St. Andrews]], and [[Marion Ogilvy]]. Their children were:\n\n*Anne Home (d. 1621), who married Sir James Home of Whitrig (d. between 1614\u20131620). Their son became [[James Home, 3rd Earl of Home]].\n*Elizabeth Home, who married [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]].\n\nThe [[Earl of Dunbar]] died in Whitehall, London, in 1611, without male issue, whereupon the earldom and the barony became dormant.\n\nHis body was embalmed, but his funeral service did not take place in Westminster until April, after which his body was placed in a lead coffin and sent to Scotland where it was buried under the floor of [[Dunbar Collegiate Church|Dunbar parish church]], midway between the font and the pulpit. A magnificent monument, said to be finer than any in [[Westminster Abbey]], was erected in his honour, which is still the distinguishing feature of the interior of this church.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Jesus Hospital]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''George Home, Earl of Dunbar'', three lectures by the Reverend J Kirk, MC, CF, (Minister of Dunbar Parish Church 1913-1918), Edinburgh, 1918.\n*''MSS of Colonel Mordaunt-Hay of Duns Castle'', [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], collection no.5, 1909, page 66, number 180.
