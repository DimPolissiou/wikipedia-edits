In 1912, Solax invested $100,000 for a new studio in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], the center of American filmmaking prior to the establishment of Hollywood. That year, she made the film ''[[A Fool and His Money (1912 film)|A Fool and His Money]]'', probably the first to have an all-[[African-American]] cast. The film is now at the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afifest.afi.com/2002/sections/a-fool-and-his-money |accessdate=25 February 2018|title=AFI FEST}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIn 1865,<ref>Archives de Paris, Marriages, 18 Juilliet 1865, Clichy Hauts de Seine, 4 E/CLI_66.</ref> Alice's father, Emile Guy, an owner of a bookstore and publishing company in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Chile]], married Marie Clotilde Franceline Aubert. The couple returned to Santiago after the wedding in Paris. In early 1873, Marie and Emile lived in Santiago, with Alice's four siblings.\n\nThere was a devastating smallpox epidemic in Chile in 1872 and 1873.<ref>New York Times, South America, Terrible Ravages of Small-Pox on the West Coast, September 26, 1872. British Medical Journal, vol. 1, 1875</ref> Emile and Marie Guy brought all four of their children back to Paris, where Alice was born. In her autobiography, Alice refers to her mother's attempt to make sure \"one of her children should be French\". Her father returned to Chile soon after her birth, and her mother followed a few months later. Alice was entrusted to her grandmother in [[Carouge, Switzerland]].<ref>Nicolas Aubert, her grandfather, died October 11, 1872</ref> At the age of three or four, Alice's mother returned from Chile and took Alice back to South America.\n\nAt the age of six, Alice was taken back to France by her father to attend school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart (also known as the Faithful Companions of Jesus) on the French side of the Swiss border in Veyrier, France (arrondissement of Viry). (Her sisters were already there.) Alice and her sister Rose were moved to a convent in Ferney a few years later and then brought back to Paris.\n\nAlice's father died on January 5, 1891 of unknown causes.<ref>Archives de Paris, Deces 6e arr. 5 Janvier 1891 V4E5962</ref> Following his death, Alice trained as a typist and stenographer, a new field at the time, to support herself and her widowed mother. She landed her first stenography-typist job at a varnish factory. In March 1894, she began working at the 'Comptoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la photographie' owned by Felix-Max Richard.

The company changed hands in 1895 due to a court decision against Felix-Max Richard who sold the company to four men: [[Gustave Eiffel]], Joseph Vallot, Alfred Besnier, and Leon Gaumont. Gustave Eiffel was president of the company, and Leon Gaumont, thirty years Eiffel's junior, was the manager. The company was named after Gaumont because Eiffel was the subject of a national scandal regarding the Panama Canal.<ref>Les premieres annees de la societe L.

Gaumont et Cie became a major force in the fledgling motion-picture industry in France.

It was the first demonstration of film projection, an obstacle that Gaumont and the Lumi\u00e8res (as well as Edison) were racing to solve. They screened one of their early films ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory]]'', and it only consisted of a simple scene of workmen leaving the Lumi\u00e8re plant in Lyon. Bored with the idea of captured film only being used for the scientific and/or promotional purpose of selling cameras in the form of \"demonstration films\", she was confident that she could incorporate fictional story-telling elements into film. She asked Gaumont for permission to make her own film, and he granted it.\n\nGuy-Blach\u00e9's first film, and arguably the world's first narrative film, was called ''[[La F\u00e9e aux Choux]]'' (''The Cabbage Fairy''), in 1896. The scene Alice described does not match either the 1900 version or the 1902 version that have been discovered. Alice said she filmed the first version in 1896. A July 30, 1896 newspaper describes a \"chaste fiction of children born under the cabbages in a wonderfully framed chromo landscape\" and provides other details that confirm Alice's description of her first film.<ref>Gil Blas, 30 July 1896</ref><ref>Dietrick, Janelle, ''Alice & Eiffel, A New History of Early Cinema and the Love Story Kept Secret for a Century'', pp. 193\u2013203, 2016</ref><ref>Dietrick, Janelle, La F\u00e9e aux Choux, Alice Guy's Garden of Dreams, 2018</ref>\n\nFrom 1896 to 1906, Guy-Blach\u00e9 was Gaumont's head of production and is generally considered to be the first filmmaker to systematically develop [[narrative]] filmmaking.

She explored dance and travel films, often combining the two, such as ''Le Bolero'' performed by Miss [[Saharet]] (1905) and ''Tango'' (1905). Many of Guy-Blach\u00e9's early dance films were popular in music-hall attractions such as the [[serpentine dance]] films &ndash; also a staple of the Lumi\u00e8res and [[Thomas Edison]] film catalogs.<ref name=\"Alice Guy Blach\u00e9 Cinema Pioneer\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=Alice Guy Blach\u00e9 Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, she made ''[[The Life of Christ]]'', a big budget production for the time, which included 300 extras. She used the illustrated [[James Tissot|Tissot]] Bible as reference material for the film, which featured &nbsp;twenty-five episodes and was her largest production at Gaumont to date. In addition to this, she was one of the pioneers in the use of audio recordings in conjunction with the images on screen in Gaumont's \"[[Sound-on-disc|Chronophone]]\" system, which used a vertical-cut disc synchronized to the film. She employed some of the first special effects, including using double exposure, [[Masking_(art)#Film|masking techniques]], and running a film backwards.<ref name=\"McMahan2002\">{{cite book|author=Alison McMahan|title=Alice Guy Blach\u00e9: Lost Visionary of the Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoGCsatYi5sC|date=1 January 2002|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-5158-3}}</ref>\n\n===Solax===\n[[File:Still from Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 - film Two little strangers - 1912 - Solax - EYE FOT414158.jpg|thumb|Still from ''Two Little Rangers'' (1912)]]\nIn 1907, Alice Guy married [[Herbert Blach\u00e9]], who was soon appointed the production manager for Gaumont's operations in the United States.

British Medical Journal, vol. 1, 1875</ref> Emile and Marie Guy brought all four of their children back to Paris, where Alice was born. In her autobiography, Alice refers to her mother's attempt to make sure \"one of her children should be French\". Her father returned to Chile soon after her birth, and her mother followed a few months later. Alice was entrusted to her grandmother in [[Carouge, Switzerland]].<ref>Nicolas Aubert, her grandfather, died October 11, 1872</ref> At the age of three or four, Alice's mother returned from Chile and took Alice back to South America.\n\nAt the age of six, Alice was taken back to France by her father to attend school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart (also known as the Faithful Companions of Jesus) on the French side of the Swiss border in Veyrier, France (arrondissement of Viry). (Her sisters were already there.) Alice and her sister Rose were moved to a convent in Ferney a few years later and then brought back to Paris.\n\nAlice's father died on January 5, 1891 of unknown causes.<ref>Archives de Paris, Deces 6e arr. 5 Janvier 1891 V4E5962</ref> Following his death, Alice trained as a typist and stenographer, a new field at the time, to support herself and her widowed mother. She landed her first stenography-typist job at a varnish factory. In March 1894, she began working at the 'Comptoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la photographie' owned by Felix-Max Richard.

The company changed hands in 1895 due to a court decision against Felix-Max Richard who sold the company to four men: [[Gustave Eiffel]], Joseph Vallot, Alfred Besnier, and Leon Gaumont. Gustave Eiffel was president of the company, and Leon Gaumont, thirty years Eiffel's junior, was the manager. The company was named after Gaumont because Eiffel was the subject of a national scandal regarding the Panama Canal.<ref>Les premieres annees de la societe L.

Gaumont et Cie became a major force in the fledgling motion-picture industry in France.

It was the first demonstration of film projection, an obstacle that Gaumont and the Lumi\u00e8res (as well as Edison) were racing to solve. They screened one of their early films ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory]]'', and it only consisted of a simple scene of workmen leaving the Lumi\u00e8re plant in Lyon. Bored with the idea of captured film only being used for the scientific and/or promotional purpose of selling cameras in the form of \"demonstration films\", she was confident that she could incorporate fictional story-telling elements into film. She asked Gaumont for permission to make her own film, and he granted it.\n\nGuy-Blach\u00e9's first film, and arguably the world's first narrative film, was called ''[[La F\u00e9e aux Choux]]'' (''The Cabbage Fairy''), in 1896. The scene Alice described does not match either the 1900 version or the 1902 version that have been discovered. Alice said she filmed the first version in 1896. A July 30, 1896 newspaper describes a \"chaste fiction of children born under the cabbages in a wonderfully framed chromo landscape\" and provides other details that confirm Alice's description of her first film.<ref>Gil Blas, 30 July 1896</ref><ref>Dietrick, Janelle, ''Alice & Eiffel, A New History of Early Cinema and the Love Story Kept Secret for a Century'', pp. 193\u2013203, 2016</ref><ref>Dietrick, Janelle, La F\u00e9e aux Choux, Alice Guy's Garden of Dreams, 2018</ref>\n\nFrom 1896 to 1906, Guy-Blach\u00e9 was Gaumont's head of production and is generally considered to be the first filmmaker to systematically develop [[narrative]] filmmaking.

She explored dance and travel films, often combining the two, such as ''Le Bolero'' performed by Miss [[Saharet]] (1905) and ''Tango'' (1905).

She used the illustrated [[James Tissot|Tissot]] Bible as reference material for the film, which featured \u00a0twenty-five episodes and was her largest production at Gaumont to date. In addition to this, she was one of the pioneers in the use of audio recordings in conjunction with the images on screen in Gaumont's \"[[Sound-on-disc|Chronophone]]\" system, which used a vertical-cut disc synchronized to the film.

In 1912, when she was pregnant with her second child, she built a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and continued to complete one to three films a week. To focus on writing and directing, Guy-Blach\u00e9 made her husband the president of Solax in 1913.<ref>Moving Picture World, 14 June 1913, p. 1140</ref>\n\nShortly after taking the position, Herbert Blach\u00e9 started a film company called Blach\u00e9 Features, Inc. For the next few years, the couple maintained a personal and business partnership, working together on many projects.
