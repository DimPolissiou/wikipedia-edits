The song was released as the first single from the [[remix album]] ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]''. Jackson and [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] created the track in time for the 1991 release of ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]''. However, it did not appear on that record and was worked on further for its commercial release in 1997. The song is about a predatory woman by the name of Susie, who seduces Jackson before plotting to stab him with a knife. The composition explores a variety of genres ranging from [[funk]] and [[new jack swing]].\n\nThe single peaked at number 42 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reached number one in Denmark, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. It also reached the top 10 several other countries, including Australia, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Commentators compared \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" to music from ''Dangerous''. Others commented on the song's perceived aggressive tone and the vocal style, the broad genres heard and possible lyrical interpretations of the song. Reviews at the time of release were largely mixed, but contemporary reviews have been favorable. The song was promoted with a [[music video]] that premiered on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. It centered on Susie seducing Jackson in a courtship \"dance\", before opening a [[switchblade]]. \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" was the only track from the remix album performed on the [[HIStory World Tour]].\n\n==Production and music==\n[[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] came up with the song's title while Jackson recorded the piece for his ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' album in 1991\u2014it failed to make the final track listing. Riley was reportedly upset that Jackson did not call him to \"vacuum clean this old master\" upon realizing it would be included on ''Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix''. Riley wanted to update the musical composition before it appeared on the remix album.<ref name = \"halstead 46-48\">{{cite book |last=Halstead |first=Craig |title=Michael Jackson: For the Record |year=2007 |publisher=Authors OnLine |pages=46\u201348 |isbn=978-0-7552-0267-6 }}</ref> In a Making Michael interview, Matt Forger mentioned that the original Teddy Riley DAT version (which Teddy Riley played to Jackson when he came to work on \"Dangerous\") to Montreux where Jackson cut his vocals when work began on the album.<ref name=\"Full interview with longtime Michael Jackson collaborator and friend Matt Forger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.makingmichael.co.uk/single-post/2016l/11/21/Full-interview-with-longtime-Michael-Jackson-collaborator-and-friend-LForger}}</ref> Also, Brad Buxer added more instrumentation to the track during the sessions.\n \nInstruments played in the song include a guitar and piano, the latter of which has an F2-Eb5 range in [[scientific pitch notation]].

However, the single was [[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)#Planned single release|cancelled]], and all of the remixes were shelved. It is likely that the reason some of these remixes were released as part of this single is due to its association with the ''Dangerous'' album, since it was originally created during its recording sessions. Regardless, the majority of Sanchez' original remixes remain unreleased, and are only available on a rare [[digital audio tape]] distributed among label executives.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Michael-Jackson-Dangerous-Remixes-Roger-Sanchez/release/3330863</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' described \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" as an angry tale of a back-stabbing woman and Michael Saunders of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described it as \"a middling dance-funk cut\".<ref name=\"Saunders\">Michael Saunders.

The impaled image is that of a blood dripping love heart with \"SUSIE + ME\" scrawled across it. Jackson and a group of dancers then enter a salsa dance hall and he begins to dance with a woman, \"Susie\", while shaking a piece of [[percussion]]. The singer then appears seated while the woman dances seductively above him on a table top.\n\nAfter the 1st verse and chorus, there is an a cappella moment, in which Jackson breathes to the drums and the bass, then the strings, then spins, drops down and claps, then the main song starts with the 2nd verse.\n\nThroughout the video, Jackson shows a sexual attraction towards the dancing woman\u2014played by Sybil Azur. Jackson caresses her ankle, calf, knee and thigh, and at one stage looks up her dress. The woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance.

The song was released as the first single from the [[remix album]] ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]''. Jackson and [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] created the track in time for the 1991 release of ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]''. However, it did not appear on that record and was worked on further for its commercial release in 1997. The song is about a predatory woman by the name of Susie, who seduces Jackson before plotting to stab him with a knife. The composition explores a variety of genres ranging from [[funk]] and [[new jack swing]].\n\nThe single peaked at number 42 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reached number one in Denmark, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. It also reached the top 10 several other countries, including Australia, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Commentators compared \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" to music from ''Dangerous''. Others commented on the song's perceived aggressive tone and the vocal style, the broad genres heard and possible lyrical interpretations of the song. Reviews at the time of release were largely mixed, but contemporary reviews have been favorable. The song was promoted with a [[music video]] that premiered on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. It centered on Susie seducing Jackson in a courtship \"dance\", before opening a [[switchblade]]. \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" was the only track from the remix album performed on the [[HIStory World Tour]].\n\n==Production and music==\n[[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] came up with the song's title while Jackson recorded the piece for his ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' album in 1991\u2014it failed to make the final track listing. Riley was reportedly upset that Jackson did not call him to \"vacuum clean this old master\" upon realizing it would be included on ''Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix''. Riley wanted to update the musical composition before it appeared on the remix album.<ref name = \"halstead 46-48\">{{cite book |last=Halstead |first=Craig |title=Michael Jackson: For the Record |year=2007 |publisher=Authors OnLine |pages=46\u201348 |isbn=978-0-7552-0267-6 }}</ref> In a Making Michael interview, Matt Forger mentioned that the original Teddy Riley DAT version (which Teddy Riley played to Jackson when he came to work on \"Dangerous\") to Montreux where Jackson cut his vocals when work began on the album.<ref name=\"Full interview with longtime Michael Jackson collaborator and friend Matt Forger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.makingmichael.co.uk/single-post/2016l/11/21/Full-interview-with-longtime-Michael-Jackson-collaborator-and-friend-LForger}}</ref> Also, Brad Buxer added more instrumentation to the track during the sessions.\n \nInstruments played in the song include a guitar and piano, the latter of which has an F2-Eb5 range in [[scientific pitch notation]].

However, the single was [[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)#Planned single release|cancelled]], and all of the remixes were shelved. It is likely that the reason some of these remixes were released as part of this single is due to its association with the ''Dangerous'' album, since it was originally created during its recording sessions. Regardless, the majority of Sanchez' original remixes remain unreleased, and are only available on a rare [[digital audio tape]] distributed among label executives.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Michael-Jackson-Dangerous-Remixes-Roger-Sanchez/release/3330863</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' described \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" as an angry tale of a back-stabbing woman and Michael Saunders of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described it as \"a middling dance-funk cut\".<ref name=\"Saunders\">Michael Saunders.

The impaled image is that of a blood dripping love heart with \"SUSIE + ME\" scrawled across it. Jackson and a group of dancers then enter a salsa dance hall and he begins to dance with a woman, \"Susie\", while shaking a piece of [[percussion]]. The singer then appears seated while the woman dances seductively above him on a table top.\n\nAfter the 1st verse and chorus, there is an a cappella moment, in which Jackson breathes to the drums and the bass, then the strings, then spins, drops down and claps, then the main song starts with the 2nd verse.\n\nThroughout the video, Jackson shows a sexual attraction towards the dancing woman\u2014played by Sybil Azur. Jackson caresses her ankle, calf, knee and thigh, and at one stage looks up her dress. The woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance.

Michael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as such&nbsp;... We just went into this one with our global hats on\".

The song was also originally slated to be performed during the \"[[This Is It (concert residency)|This Is It]]\" concerts, which was scheduled to run from July 2009 to March 2010, but was later removed from the set-list.\n\n==Chart performance==\nThe song became a top ten hit in almost every [[European Union]] state. \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" peaked at number one in the UK, Spain and New Zealand, charting for 11 weeks in the latter two nations. In the UK it sold 85,000 copies in its first week, enough to take the number one spot from \"[[I Believe I Can Fly]]\" by collaborator [[R. Kelly]]. The song was Jackson's seventh (and currently final) UK chart topper as a solo artist, although it fell to number eight in its second week of release. The European country where \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" had the most longevity was Switzerland, where it spent 18 weeks in the chart.\n\nThe single peaked at number 42 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This relatively lower peak position has been attributed to the lack of US promotion and\u2014according to J. Randy Taraborrelli and AllMusic writer William Ruhlman\u2014the ongoing US public interest in the singer's private life over his music.<ref name = \"tara 610-611\"/><ref>{{cite web|first=William |last=Ruhlmann |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/14225868 |title=Blood On The Dance Floor Review |website=AllMusic |date=July 13, 2005 |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050826081749/http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/14225868 |archivedate=August 26, 2005 }}</ref> \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" was the 20th and last of Jackson's reissued singles from the ''[[Visionary: The Video Singles|Visionary]]'' campaign.

This program was a matching grant partnership system between the federal and provincial governments. It was started in 1939 and ended with the start to the CSLP in 1964.\n\nSome text from the Department of Human Resources and Social Development Canada:\n<blockquote>\nThe CSLP was created in 1964. Since its inception, the Program has supplemented the financial resources available to eligible students from other sources to assist in their pursuit of post-secondary education. Between 1964 and 1995, loans were provided by financial institutions to post-secondary students who were approved to receive financial assistance. The financial institutions also administered the loan repayment process. In return, the Government of Canada guaranteed each Canada Student Loan that was issued, by reimbursing the financial institution the full amount of loans that went into default.\n\nIn 1995, several important changes were made to Canada Student Loans.  First, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act was proclaimed, replacing the existing Canada Student Loans Act (which does not remain in force to this day) reflecting the changing needs of the parties involved in the loan process, including the conferred responsibility of the collection of defaulted loans to the banks themselves. The Government of Canada developed a formalized \"risk-shared\" agreement with several financial institutions, whereby the institution would assume responsibility for the possible risk of defaulted loans in return for a fixed payment from the Government which correlated with the amount of loans that were expected to be, or were, in default in each calendar year. During this period, the weekly federal loan amount was increased to a maximum of $165.\n\nOn July 31, 2000, the risk-shared arrangement between the Government of Canada and participating financial institutions came to an end. The Government of Canada now directly finances all new loans issued on or after August 1, 2000. The administration of Canada Student Loans has become the responsibility of the National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC). There were two divisions of the NSLSC, one to manage loans for students attending public institutions and the other to administer loans for students attending private institutions, but these two centers were merged into one. Defaulted Canada Student Loans disbursed under this new regime are now collected by the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] which, by [[Order in Council]] dated August 1, 2005, became responsible for the collection of all debts due under programs administered by Human Resources and Social Development Canada.\n</blockquote>\n\nDue to the close nature of the CSLP and the provincial student loan programs, the changes in 1995 and 2000 were largely mirrored by the provincial programs.  As a result of these changes, students who attended school before and after these transition years may find that they have up to 6 different loans to manage (pre-1995 federal & provincial; 1995-2000 federal & provincial; and post-2000 federal & provincial).  The extent to which this is possible depends largely on a student's province of residence.\n\n==Financial aid programs in Canada by province and territory==\n\n* Alberta: [[Alberta Student Aid]]\n* British Columbia: [[StudentAid BC]]\n* Manitoba: [[Manitoba Student Aid|Manitoba student aid]]\n* Ontario: [[Ontario Student Assistance Program]]\n* New Brunswick: [[Higher education in New Brunswick#Canada Student Loan and New Brunswick Student Loan|Canada Student Loan and New Brunswick Student Loan]]\n* Newfoundland and Labrador: [[Higher education in Newfoundland and Labrador#Student Aid|Newfoundland and Labrador Student Aid]]\n* Northwest Territories: [[NWT Student Financial Assistance]]\n* Nova Scotia: [[Nova Scotia Student Assistance]]\n* Nunavut: [[Financial Assistance for Nunavut Students (FANS)]]\n* Prince Edward Island: [[PEI Student Loan]]\n* Quebec: [[L'Aide financi\u00e8re aux \u00e9tudes (AFE)]][https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide_financi%C3%A8re_aux_%C3%A9tudes]\n* Saskatchewan: [[Saskatchewan Student Loans]]\n* Yukon: [[Yukon Student Financial Assistance]]\n\n==Students in professional programs==\nMost charter banks in Canada have specific programs for students in professional programs (e.g., medicine) that can provide more funds than usual in the form of a line of credit, sometimes with lower interest rates as well.

These are provided to government-sponsored student loanholders. Among these programs are:<br>\n\n;Repayment Assistance<ref name=\"HRSDC - Repayment Assistance Plan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student-aid/grants-loans/repay/assistance/rap.html</ref>\n:Repayment Assistance is designed to help students meet repayment obligations if they are temporarily unable to make payments on their government student loans because of unemployment or low income. Repayment Assistance is granted for periods of six months. Some rules, such as Canadian residency, may apply. Once approved for Repayment Assistance, borrowers will be assessed for an affordable payment amount which may be zero or more. The Federal and/or provincial government will then assist in paying interest and/or principal so long as the borrower continues to be approved for the program. Borrowers can apply online on the NSLSC website. \n\n;Revision of Terms<ref name=\"HRSDC - Revision of Terms\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/hip/cslp/Revision.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606140922/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/hip/cslp/Revision.shtml|archivedate=2007-06-06|title=HRSDC - Revision of Terms|accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>\n:Revision of Terms is a feature that provides students with the flexibility to manage loan repayment in a way that is responsive to individual situations. It can be used to decrease monthly payments by increasing the repayment period (from the standard 11.5 years up to 15 years) should a student find the standard terms difficult to maintain. It can also be used to increase loan payments by reducing the repayment period, allowing more rapid repayment of a loan.\n\n;Severe Permanent Disability Benefit<ref name=\"HRSDC - Permanent Disability Benefit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/learning/canada_student_loan/permanent_disability.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919032720/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/learning/canada_student_loan/permanent_disability.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-19|title=HRSDC - Permanent Disability Benefit|accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>\n:Along with Repayment Assistance for borrowers with permanent disabilities, the Severe Permanent Disability Benefit is an additional program for borrowers with disabilities.

The extent to which this is possible depends largely on a student's province of residence.  yes\n\n==Financial aid programs in Canada by province and territory==\n\n* Alberta: [[Alberta Student Aid]]\n* British Columbia: [[StudentAid BC]]\n* Manitoba: [[Manitoba Student Aid|Manitoba student aid]]\n* Ontario: [[Ontario Student Assistance Program]]\n* New Brunswick: [[Higher education in New Brunswick#Canada Student Loan and New Brunswick Student Loan|Canada Student Loan and New Brunswick Student Loan]]\n* Newfoundland and Labrador: [[Higher education in Newfoundland and Labrador#Student Aid|Newfoundland and Labrador Student Aid]]\n* Northwest Territories: [[NWT Student Financial Assistance]]\n* Nova Scotia: [[Nova Scotia Student Assistance]]\n* Nunavut: [[Financial Assistance for Nunavut Students (FANS)]]\n* Prince Edward Island: [[PEI Student Loan]]\n* Quebec: [[L'Aide financi\u00e8re aux \u00e9tudes (AFE)]][https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide_financi%C3%A8re_aux_%C3%A9tudes]\n* Saskatchewan: [[Saskatchewan Student Loans]]\n* Yukon: [[Yukon Student Financial Assistance]]\n\n==Students in professional programs==\nMost charter banks in Canada have specific programs for students in professional programs (e.g., medicine) that can provide more funds than usual in the form of a line of credit, sometimes with lower interest rates as well.

Repayment Assistance is granted for periods of six months. Some rules, such as Canadian residency, may apply. Once approved for Repayment Assistance, borrowers will be assessed for an affordable payment amount which may be zero or more. The Federal and/or provincial government will then assist in paying interest and/or principal so long as the borrower continues to be approved for the program. Borrowers can apply online on the NSLSC website. \n\n;Revision of Terms<ref name=\"HRSDC - Revision of Terms\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/hip/cslp/Revision.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606140922/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/hip/cslp/Revision.shtml|archivedate=2007-06-06|title=HRSDC - Revision of Terms|accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>\n:Revision of Terms is a feature that provides students with the flexibility to manage loan repayment in a way that is responsive to individual situations. It can be used to decrease monthly payments by increasing the repayment period (from the standard 11.5 years up to 15 years) should a student find the standard terms difficult to maintain. It can also be used to increase loan payments by reducing the repayment period, allowing more rapid repayment of a loan.\n\n;Severe Permanent Disability Benefit<ref name=\"HRSDC - Permanent Disability Benefit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/learning/canada_student_loan/permanent_disability.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919032720/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/learning/canada_student_loan/permanent_disability.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-19|title=HRSDC - Permanent Disability Benefit|accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>\n:Along with Repayment Assistance for borrowers with permanent disabilities, the Severe Permanent Disability Benefit is an additional program for borrowers with disabilities.

Most of Reuchlin's career centered on advancing German knowledge of Greek and Hebrew.\n\n==Early life==\n\nJohann Reuchlin was born at [[Pforzheim]] in the [[Black Forest]] in 1455, where his father was an official of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery.<ref name=\"Brittanica\">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volume 23|date=1911|publisher=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Company|location=New York|page=203|edition=11}}</ref>  According to the fashion of the time, his name was [[Greek language|graecized]] by his Italian friends into '''Capnion''' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd), a [[nickname]] which Reuchlin used as a sort of transparent mask when he introduced himself as an interlocutor in the ''De Verbo Mirifico''. He remained fond of his home town; he constantly calls himself '''Phorcensis''', and in the ''De Verbo'' he ascribes to Pforzheim his inclination towards literature.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nHere he began his [[Latin]] studies in the monastery school, and, though in 1470 he was for a short time at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], that university seems to have taught him little.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" /> Reuchlin's career as a scholar appears to have turned almost on an accident; his fine voice gained him a place in the household of [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles I, Margrave of Baden]], and soon, having some reputation as a Latinist, he was chosen to accompany Frederick, the third son of the prince, to the [[University of Paris]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Frederick was some years his junior, and was destined for an ecclesiastical career. This new connection did not last long, but it determined the course of Reuchlin's life. He now began to learn [[Greek language|Greek]], which had been taught in the French capital since 1470, and he also attached himself to the leader of the Paris realists, [[Jean Heynlin|Jean \u00e0 Lapide]] (d. 1496), a worthy and learned man, whom he followed to the vigorous young [[University of Basel]] in 1474.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\n==Teaching and writing career==\n[[Image:Widmung-Reuchlins.jpg|thumb|left|Johann Reuchlin's [[coat of arms]]]]\n\nAt [[University of Basel|Basel]] Reuchlin took his master's degree (1477), and began to lecture with success, teaching a more classical Latin than was then common in German schools, and explaining [[Aristotle]] in Greek.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" /> His studies in this language had been continued at [[Basel]] under [[Andronicus Contoblacas]], and here he formed the acquaintance of the bookseller, [[Johann Amerbach]], for whom he prepared a Latin [[lexicon]] (''Vocabularius Breviloquus'', 1st ed, 1475\u201376), which ran through many editions. This first publication, and Reuchlin's account of his teaching at Basel in a letter to Cardinal Adrian ([[Adriano Castellesi]]) in February 1518, show that he had already found his life's work. He was a born teacher, and this work was not to be done mainly from the professor's chair.\n\nReuchlin soon left Basel to seek further Greek training with [[George Hermonymus]] at Paris, and to learn to write a fair Greek hand that he might support himself by copying manuscripts. And now he felt that he must choose a profession. His choice fell on [[law]], and he was thus led to the great school of [[University of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] (1478), and finally to [[University of Poitiers|Poitiers]], where he became [[Licence (France)|licentiate]] in July 1481. From Poitiers Reuchlin went in December 1481 to [[T\u00fcbingen]] with the intention of becoming a teacher in the [[University of T\u00fcbingen|local university]], but his friends recommended him to Count [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who was about to journey to [[Italy]] and required an interpreter. Reuchlin was selected for this post, and in February 1482 left [[Stuttgart]] for [[Florence]] and [[Rome]]. The journey lasted but a few months, but it brought the German scholar into contact with several learned Italians, especially at the Medicean Academy in Florence; his connection with the count became permanent, and after his return to Stuttgart he received important posts at Eberhard's court.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nAbout this time he appears to have married, but little is known of his married life. He left no children; but in later years his sister's grandson [[Philipp Melanchthon]] was like a son to him till the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] estranged them. In 1490 he was again in Italy. Here he saw [[Pico della Mirandola]], to whose [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] doctrines he afterwards became heir, and made a friend of the pope's secretary, [[Jakob Questenberg]], which was of service to him in his later troubles. Again in 1492 he was employed on an embassy to the emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] at [[Linz]], and here he began to read Hebrew with the emperor's Jewish physician [[Jakob ben Jehiel Loans]].  Loans's instruction laid the basis of that thorough knowledge which Reuchlin afterwards improved on his third visit to Rome in 1498 by the instruction of [[Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno|Obadja Sforno]] of [[Cesena]]. In 1494 his rising reputation had been greatly enhanced by the publication of ''De Verbo Mirifico''.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nIn 1496 Duke Eberhard I of W\u00fcrttemberg died, and enemies of Reuchlin had the ear of his successor, Duke Heinrich of W\u00fcrttemberg (formerly Heinrich Count of W\u00fcrttemberg-M\u00f6mpelgard). He was glad, therefore, hastily to follow the invitation of [[Johann von Dalberg]] (1445\u20131503), the scholarly bishop of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and flee to [[Heidelberg]], which was then the seat of the [[Rhenish Missionary Society|Rhenish Society]] In this court of letters Reuchlin's appointed function was to make translations from the Greek authors, in which his reading was already extremely wide. Though Reuchlin had no public office as teacher, he was for much of his life the real centre of all Greek and Hebrew teaching in Germany. To carry out this work he provided a series of aids for beginners and others. He never published a Greek grammar, but he had one in manuscript for use with his pupils, and also published several little elementary Greek books. Reuchlin, it may be noted, pronounced Greek as his native teachers had taught him to do, i.e., in the modern Greek fashion. This pronunciation, which he defends in ''De recta Latini Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione'' (1528), came to be known, in contrast to that used by [[Desiderius Erasmus]], as the [[Reuchlinian pronunciation|Reuchlinian]].<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nAt Heidelberg Reuchlin had many private pupils, among whom [[Franz von Sickingen]] is the best known name. With the [[monk]]s he had never been liked; at Stuttgart also his great enemy was the [[Augustinian]] [[Conrad Holzinger]]. On this man he took a scholar's revenge in his first Latin comedy ''Sergius'', a satire on worthless monks and false relics.  Through Dalberg, Reuchlin came into contact with [[Philip, Count Palatine of the Rhine]], who employed him to direct the studies of his sons, and in 1498 gave him the mission to Rome which has been already noticed as fruitful for Reuchlin's progress in Hebrew. He came back laden with Hebrew books, and found when he reached Heidelberg that a change of government had opened the way for his return to Stuttgart, where his wife had remained all along. His friends had now again the upper hand, and knew Reuchlin's value. In 1500, or perhaps in 1502, he was given a very high judicial office in the [[Swabian League]], which he held till 1512, when he retired to a small estate near Stuttgart.\n\n==Hebrew studies and advocacy==\nFor many years Reuchlin had been increasingly absorbed in [[Hebrew studies]], which had for him more than a mere [[philology|philological]] interest. He was interested in the reform of preaching as shown in his ''De Arte Predicandi'' (1503)\u2014a book which became a sort of preacher's manual; but above all as a scholar he was eager that the Bible should be better known, and could not tie himself to the authority of the [[Vulgate]].<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nThe key to the ''Hebraea veritas'' was the grammatical and exegetical tradition of the medieval [[rabbi]]s, especially of [[David Kimhi]], and when he had mastered this himself he was resolved to open it to others. In 1506 appeared his epoch-making ''De Rudimentis Hebraicis''\u2014grammar and lexicon\u2014mainly after Kimhi, yet not a mere copy of one man's teaching. The edition was costly and sold slowly.  One great difficulty was that the wars of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in Italy prevented Hebrew Bibles coming into Germany.  But for this also Reuchlin found help by printing the Penitential Psalms with grammatical explanations (1512), and other helps followed from time to time. But his Greek studies had interested him in those fantastical and mystical systems of later times with which the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] has no small affinity.  Following Pico, he seemed to find in the Kabbala a profound theosophy which might be of the greatest service for the defence of [[Christianity]] and the reconciliation of science with the mysteries of faith, a common notion at that time. Reuchlin's mystico-cabbalistic ideas and objects were expounded in the ''De Verbo Mirifico'', and finally in the ''[[De Arte Cabbalistica]]'' (1517).<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nMany of his contemporaries thought that the first step to the [[conversion of the Jews]] was to take away their books.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />  This view was advocated by [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]], a [[Germany|German]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[theologian]].<ref name=deutsch>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=246&letter=P\n|title=Pfefferkorn, Johann (Joseph)\n|first=Gotthard\n|last=Deutsch\n|authorlink=Gotthard Deutsch\n|author2=Frederick T.

He wrote that \"The causes which hinder the Jews from becoming Christians are three: first, [[usury]]; second, because they are not compelled to attend Christian churches to hear the [[sermon]]s; and third, because they honor the ''Talmud''.\".<ref name=\"rodkinson\">[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/t10/ht117.htm Reuchlin, Pfefferkorn, and the Talmud in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries] in ''The Babylonian Talmud. The History of the Talmud'' translated by [[Michael Levi Rodkinson|Michael L. Rodkinson]]. Book 10 Vol. I Chapter XIV (1918) p.76</ref> Pfefferkorn's plans were backed by the Dominicans of [[Cologne]]; and in 1509 he obtained the emperor's authority to confiscate all Jewish books directed against the Christian faith. Armed with this mandate, he visited Stuttgart and asked Reuchlin's help as a jurist and expert in putting it into execution. Reuchlin evaded the demand, mainly because the mandate lacked certain formalities, but he could no long remain neutral. The execution of Pfefferkorn's schemes led to difficulties and to a new appeal to Maximilian.\n\nIn 1510 Reuchlin was appointed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] to a commission which was convened to review the matter. His answer is dated from Stuttgart, 6 October 1510; in it he divides the books into six classes \u2014 apart from the [[Bible]] which no one proposed to destroy \u2014 and, going through each class, he shows that the books openly insulting to Christianity are very few and viewed as worthless by most Jews themselves, while the others are either works necessary to the Jewish worship, which was licensed by papal as well as imperial law, or contain matter of value and scholarly interest which ought not to be sacrificed because they are connected with another faith than that of the Christians. He proposed that the emperor should decree that for ten years there should be two Hebrew chairs at every German university, for which the Jews should furnish books.\n\nMaximilian's other experts proposed that all books should be taken from the Jews; and, as the emperor still hesitated, his opponents threw on Reuchlin the whole blame of their ill success. Pfefferkorn circulated at the Frankfurt Fair of 1511 a gross [[libel]] (''Handspiegel wider und gegen die Juden'') declaring that Reuchlin had been bribed.  Reuchlin defended himself in a pamphlet titled ''Augenspiegel'' (1511), which the theologians at the [[University of Cologne]] attempted to suppress. On 7 October 1512 they, along with the inquisitor [[Jacob van Hoogstraaten]], obtained an imperial order confiscating the ''Augenspiegel''.\n\nIn 1513 Reuchlin was summoned before a court of the [[inquisition]]. He was willing to receive corrections in theology, which was not his subject, but he could not unsay what he had said; and as his enemies tried to press him into a corner he met them with open defiance in a ''Defensio contra Calumniatores'' (1513). The universities were now appealed to for opinions, and were all against Reuchlin. Even Paris (August 1514) condemned the ''Augenspiegel'', and called on Reuchlin to recant. Meantime a formal process had begun at Mainz before the grand inquisitor. But Reuchlin managed to have the jurisdiction changed to the episcopal court of [[Speyer]].  The Reuchlin affair caused a wide rift in the church and eventually the case came before the papal court in Rome. Judgment was not finally given till July 1516; and then, though the decision was really for Reuchlin, the trial was simply quashed. The result had cost Reuchlin years of trouble and no small part of his modest fortune, but it was worth the sacrifice. For far above the direct importance of the issue was the great stirring of public opinion which had gone forward.\n\nAnd while the [[obscurantist]]s escaped easily at Rome, with only a half condemnation, they received a crushing blow in Germany. In Reuchlin's defense, ''Virorum Epistol\u00e6 Clarorum ad Reuchlinum Phorcensem'' (Letters of famous men to Reuchlin of Pforzheim),<ref>{{Cite NIE| wstitle =Epistol\u00e6 Obscurorum Virorum | year = 1905}}</ref> had been published. It was closely followed by ''[[Epistol\u00e6 Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (Letters of obscure men), a satirical collection purporting to defend his accusers, but actually directed against them. No party could survive the ridicule that was poured on Reuchlin's opponents by this document.\n\n[[Ulrich von Hutten]] and [[Franz von Sickingen]] did all they could to force Reuchlin's enemies to a restitution of his material damages; they even threatened a feud against the Dominicans of Cologne and Spires. In 1520, a commission met in Frankfurt to investigate the case. It condemned Hoogstraaten. But the final decision of Rome did not indemnify Reuchlin. The contest ended, however; public interest had grown cold, absorbed entirely by the Lutheran question, and Reuchlin had no reason to fear new attacks.

From November of this year to the spring of 1521, the veteran statesman sought refuge in the [[University of Ingolstadt]] where he received an appointment as professor from [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria|William of Bavaria]].<ref name = amer /> He taught Greek and Hebrew there for a year. It was 41 years since at Poitiers he had last spoken from a public chair; but at 65 he retained his gift of teaching, and hundreds of scholars crowded round him. This gleam of autumn sunshine was again broken by the plague; but now he was called to T\u00fcbingen and again spent the winter of 1521\u201322 teaching in his own systematic way. But in the spring he found it necessary to visit the baths of Liebenzell, and there contracted [[jaundice]], of which he died, leaving in the history of the new learning a name only second to that of his younger contemporary [[Erasmus of Rotterdam|Erasmus]].\n\nReuchlin died in Stuttgart, and is buried at St. Leonhard church.<ref>{{Citation | last = Posset | first = F | year = 2011 | contribution = Reuchlin, Johann (1455\u20131522) | title = The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization}}.</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n* ''De Verbo Mirifico'' (''The Wonder-Working Word'', 1494)\n* ''[[De Arte Cabbalistica]]'' (''On the Art of Kabbalah'', 1517)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* ''Johannes Reuchlin and the Campaign to Destroy Jewish Books'', by [[David H.

Most of Reuchlin's career centered on advancing German knowledge of Greek and Hebrew.\n\n==Early life==\n\nJohann Reuchlin was born at [[Pforzheim]] in the [[Black Forest]] in 1455, where his father was an official of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery.<ref name=\"Brittanica\">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volume 23|date=1911|publisher=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Company|location=New York|page=203|edition=11}}</ref>  According to the fashion of the time, his name was [[Greek language|graecized]] by his Italian friends into '''Capnion''' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd), a [[nickname]] which Reuchlin used as a sort of transparent mask when he introduced himself as an interlocutor in the ''De Verbo Mirifico''. He remained fond of his home town; he constantly calls himself '''Phorcensis''', and in the ''De Verbo'' he ascribes to Pforzheim his inclination towards literature.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nHere he began his [[Latin]] studies in the monastery school, and, though in 1470 he was for a short time at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], that university seems to have taught him little.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" /> Reuchlin's career as a scholar appears to have turned almost on an accident; his fine voice gained him a place in the household of [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles I, Margrave of Baden]], and soon, having some reputation as a Latinist, he was chosen to accompany Frederick, the third son of the prince, to the [[University of Paris]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Frederick was some years his junior, and was destined for an ecclesiastical career. This new connection did not last long, but it determined the course of Reuchlin's life. He now began to learn [[Greek language|Greek]], which had been taught in the French capital since 1470, and he also attached himself to the leader of the Paris realists, [[Jean Heynlin|Jean \u00e0 Lapide]] (d. 1496), a worthy and learned man, whom he followed to the vigorous young [[University of Basel]] in 1474.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\n==Teaching and writing career==\n[[Image:Widmung-Reuchlins.jpg|thumb|left|Johann Reuchlin's [[coat of arms]]]]\n\nAt [[University of Basel|Basel]] Reuchlin took his master's degree (1477), and began to lecture with success, teaching a more classical Latin than was then common in German schools, and explaining [[Aristotle]] in Greek.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" /> His studies in this language had been continued at [[Basel]] under [[Andronicus Contoblacas]], and here he formed the acquaintance of the bookseller, [[Johann Amerbach]], for whom he prepared a Latin [[lexicon]] (''Vocabularius Breviloquus'', 1st ed, 1475\u201376), which ran through many editions. This first publication, and Reuchlin's account of his teaching at Basel in a letter to Cardinal Adrian ([[Adriano Castellesi]]) in February 1518, show that he had already found his life's work. He was a born teacher, and this work was not to be done mainly from the professor's chair.\n\nReuchlin soon left Basel to seek further Greek training with [[George Hermonymus]] at Paris, and to learn to write a fair Greek hand that he might support himself by copying manuscripts. And now he felt that he must choose a profession. His choice fell on [[law]], and he was thus led to the great school of [[University of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] (1478), and finally to [[University of Poitiers|Poitiers]], where he became [[Licence (France)|licentiate]] in July 1481. From Poitiers Reuchlin went in December 1481 to [[T\u00fcbingen]] with the intention of becoming a teacher in the [[University of T\u00fcbingen|local university]], but his friends recommended him to Count [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who was about to journey to [[Italy]] and required an interpreter. Reuchlin was selected for this post, and in February 1482 left [[Stuttgart]] for [[Florence]] and [[Rome]]. The journey lasted but a few months, but it brought the German scholar into contact with several learned Italians, especially at the Medicean Academy in Florence; his connection with the count became permanent, and after his return to Stuttgart he received important posts at Eberhard's court.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nAbout this time he appears to have married, but little is known of his married life. He left no children; but in later years his sister's grandson [[Philipp Melanchthon]] was like a son to him till the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] estranged them. In 1490 he was again in Italy. Here he saw [[Pico della Mirandola]], to whose [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] doctrines he afterwards became heir, and made a friend of the pope's secretary, [[Jakob Questenberg]], which was of service to him in his later troubles. Again in 1492 he was employed on an embassy to the emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] at [[Linz]], and here he began to read Hebrew with the emperor's Jewish physician [[Jakob ben Jehiel Loans]].  Loans's instruction laid the basis of that thorough knowledge which Reuchlin afterwards improved on his third visit to Rome in 1498 by the instruction of [[Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno|Obadja Sforno]] of [[Cesena]]. In 1494 his rising reputation had been greatly enhanced by the publication of ''De Verbo Mirifico''.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nIn 1496 Duke Eberhard I of W\u00fcrttemberg died, and enemies of Reuchlin had the ear of his successor, Duke Heinrich of W\u00fcrttemberg (formerly Heinrich Count of W\u00fcrttemberg-M\u00f6mpelgard). He was glad, therefore, hastily to follow the invitation of [[Johann von Dalberg]] (1445\u20131503), the scholarly bishop of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and flee to [[Heidelberg]], which was then the seat of the [[Rhenish Missionary Society|Rhenish Society]] In this court of letters Reuchlin's appointed function was to make translations from the Greek authors, in which his reading was already extremely wide. Though Reuchlin had no public office as teacher, he was for much of his life the real centre of all Greek and Hebrew teaching in Germany. To carry out this work he provided a series of aids for beginners and others. He never published a Greek grammar, but he had one in manuscript for use with his pupils, and also published several little elementary Greek books. Reuchlin, it may be noted, pronounced Greek as his native teachers had taught him to do, i.e., in the modern Greek fashion. This pronunciation, which he defends in ''De recta Latini Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione'' (1528), came to be known, in contrast to that used by [[Desiderius Erasmus]], as the [[Reuchlinian pronunciation|Reuchlinian]].<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nAt Heidelberg Reuchlin had many private pupils, among whom [[Franz von Sickingen]] is the best known name. With the [[monk]]s he had never been liked; at Stuttgart also his great enemy was the [[Augustinian]] [[Conrad Holzinger]]. On this man he took a scholar's revenge in his first Latin comedy ''Sergius'', a satire on worthless monks and false relics.  Through Dalberg, Reuchlin came into contact with [[Philip, Count Palatine of the Rhine]], who employed him to direct the studies of his sons, and in 1498 gave him the mission to Rome which has been already noticed as fruitful for Reuchlin's progress in Hebrew. He came back laden with Hebrew books, and found when he reached Heidelberg that a change of government had opened the way for his return to Stuttgart, where his wife had remained all along. His friends had now again the upper hand, and knew Reuchlin's value. In 1500, or perhaps in 1502, he was given a very high judicial office in the [[Swabian League]], which he held till 1512, when he retired to a small estate near Stuttgart.\n\n==Hebrew studies and advocacy==\nFor many years Reuchlin had been increasingly absorbed in [[Hebrew studies]], which had for him more than a mere [[philology|philological]] interest. He was interested in the reform of preaching as shown in his ''De Arte Predicandi'' (1503)\u2014a book which became a sort of preacher's manual; but above all as a scholar he was eager that the Bible should be better known, and could not tie himself to the authority of the [[Vulgate]].<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nThe key to the ''Hebraea veritas'' was the grammatical and exegetical tradition of the medieval [[rabbi]]s, especially of [[David Kimhi]], and when he had mastered this himself he was resolved to open it to others. In 1506 appeared his epoch-making ''De Rudimentis Hebraicis''\u2014grammar and lexicon\u2014mainly after Kimhi, yet not a mere copy of one man's teaching. The edition was costly and sold slowly.  One great difficulty was that the wars of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in Italy prevented Hebrew Bibles coming into Germany.  But for this also Reuchlin found help by printing the Penitential Psalms with grammatical explanations (1512), and other helps followed from time to time. But his Greek studies had interested him in those fantastical and mystical systems of later times with which the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] has no small affinity.  Following Pico, he seemed to find in the Kabbala a profound theosophy which might be of the greatest service for the defence of [[Christianity]] and the reconciliation of science with the mysteries of faith, a common notion at that time. Reuchlin's mystico-cabbalistic ideas and objects were expounded in the ''De Verbo Mirifico'', and finally in the ''[[De Arte Cabbalistica]]'' (1517).<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />\n\nMany of his contemporaries thought that the first step to the [[conversion of the Jews]] was to take away their books.<ref name=\"Brittanica\" />  This view was advocated by [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]], a [[Germany|German]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[theologian]].<ref name=deutsch>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=246&letter=P\n|title=Pfefferkorn, Johann (Joseph)\n|first=Gotthard\n|last=Deutsch\n|authorlink=Gotthard Deutsch\n|author2=Frederick T.

He wrote that \"The causes which hinder the Jews from becoming Christians are three: first, [[usury]]; second, because they are not compelled to attend Christian churches to hear the [[sermon]]s; and third, because they honor the ''Talmud''.\".<ref name=\"rodkinson\">[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/t10/ht117.htm Reuchlin, Pfefferkorn, and the Talmud in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries] in ''The Babylonian Talmud. The History of the Talmud'' translated by [[Michael Levi Rodkinson|Michael L. Rodkinson]]. Book 10 Vol. I Chapter XIV (1918) p.76</ref> Pfefferkorn's plans were backed by the Dominicans of [[Cologne]]; and in 1509 he obtained the emperor's authority to confiscate all Jewish books directed against the Christian faith. Armed with this mandate, he visited Stuttgart and asked Reuchlin's help as a jurist and expert in putting it into execution. Reuchlin evaded the demand, mainly because the mandate lacked certain formalities, but he could no long remain neutral. The execution of Pfefferkorn's schemes led to difficulties and to a new appeal to Maximilian.\n\nIn 1510 Reuchlin was appointed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] to a commission which was convened to review the matter. His answer is dated from Stuttgart, 6 October 1510; in it he divides the books into six classes \u2014 apart from the [[Bible]] which no one proposed to destroy \u2014 and, going through each class, he shows that the books openly insulting to Christianity are very few and viewed as worthless by most Jews themselves, while the others are either works necessary to the Jewish worship, which was licensed by papal as well as imperial law, or contain matter of value and scholarly interest which ought not to be sacrificed because they are connected with another faith than that of the Christians. He proposed that the emperor should decree that for ten years there should be two Hebrew chairs at every German university, for which the Jews should furnish books.\n\nMaximilian's other experts proposed that all books should be taken from the Jews; and, as the emperor still hesitated, his opponents threw on Reuchlin the whole blame of their ill success. Pfefferkorn circulated at the Frankfurt Fair of 1511 a gross [[libel]] (''Handspiegel wider und gegen die Juden'') declaring that Reuchlin had been bribed.  Reuchlin defended himself in a pamphlet titled ''Augenspiegel'' (1511), which the theologians at the [[University of Cologne]] attempted to suppress. On 7 October 1512 they, along with the inquisitor [[Jacob van Hoogstraaten]], obtained an imperial order confiscating the ''Augenspiegel''.\n\nIn 1513 Reuchlin was summoned before a court of the [[inquisition]]. He was willing to receive corrections in theology, which was not his subject, but he could not unsay what he had said; and as his enemies tried to press him into a corner he met them with open defiance in a ''Defensio contra Calumniatores'' (1513). The universities were now appealed to for opinions, and were all against Reuchlin. Even Paris (August 1514) condemned the ''Augenspiegel'', and called on Reuchlin to recant. Meantime a formal process had begun at Mainz before the grand inquisitor. But Reuchlin managed to have the jurisdiction changed to the episcopal court of [[Speyer]].  The Reuchlin affair caused a wide rift in the church and eventually the case came before the papal court in Rome. Judgment was not finally given till July 1516; and then, though the decision was really for Reuchlin, the trial was simply quashed. The result had cost Reuchlin years of trouble and no small part of his modest fortune, but it was worth the sacrifice. For far above the direct importance of the issue was the great stirring of public opinion which had gone forward.\n\nAnd while the [[obscurantist]]s escaped easily at Rome, with only a half condemnation, they received a crushing blow in Germany. In Reuchlin's defense, ''Virorum Epistol\u00e6 Clarorum ad Reuchlinum Phorcensem'' (Letters of famous men to Reuchlin of Pforzheim),<ref>{{Cite NIE| wstitle =Epistol\u00e6 Obscurorum Virorum | year = 1905}}</ref> had been published. It was closely followed by ''[[Epistol\u00e6 Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (Letters of obscure men), a satirical collection purporting to defend his accusers, but actually directed against them. No party could survive the ridicule that was poured on Reuchlin's opponents by this document.\n\n[[Ulrich von Hutten]] and [[Franz von Sickingen]] did all they could to force Reuchlin's enemies to a restitution of his material damages; they even threatened a feud against the Dominicans of Cologne and Spires. In 1520, a commission met in Frankfurt to investigate the case. It condemned Hoogstraaten. But the final decision of Rome did not indemnify Reuchlin. The contest ended, however; public interest had grown cold, absorbed entirely by the Lutheran question, and Reuchlin had no reason to fear new attacks. When, in 1517, he received the theses propounded by [[Martin Luther|Luther]], he exclaimed, \u201cThanks be to [[God]], at last they have found a man who will give them so much to do that they will be compelled to let my old age end in peace.\u201d<ref name = amer />\n\n[[Heinrich Graetz]] and Francis Yates contended<ref>The defense of Reuchlin, the ''Epistolae obscurorum virorum'', prefiguring Luther's opening salvo of the Reformation.  {{Citation | last = Yates | first = Franes | title =  The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age | page = 32 | publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-415-25409-4}}.</ref> that this affair helped spark the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Rummel | first = Erika | title = The case against Johann Reuchlin | pages = iv\u2013xv | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2002 | isbn =978-0-8020-8484-2}}.</ref>  Although suspected of a leaning toward Protestantism, Reuchlin never left the [[Catholic Church]].

From November of this year to the spring of 1521, the veteran statesman sought refuge in the [[University of Ingolstadt]] where he received an appointment as professor from [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria|William of Bavaria]].<ref name = amer /> He taught Greek and Hebrew there for a year. It was 41 years since at Poitiers he had last spoken from a public chair; but at 65 he retained his gift of teaching, and hundreds of scholars crowded round him. This gleam of autumn sunshine was again broken by the plague; but now he was called to T\u00fcbingen and again spent the winter of 1521\u201322 teaching in his own systematic way. But in the spring he found it necessary to visit the baths of Liebenzell, and there contracted [[jaundice]], of which he died, leaving in the history of the new learning a name only second to that of his younger contemporary [[Erasmus of Rotterdam|Erasmus]].\n\nReuchlin died in Stuttgart, and is buried at St. Leonhard church.<ref>{{Citation | last = Posset | first = F | year = 2011 | contribution = Reuchlin, Johann (1455\u20131522) | title = The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization}}.</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n* ''De Verbo Mirifico'' (''The Wonder-Working Word'', 1494)\n* ''[[De Arte Cabbalistica]]'' (''On the Art of Kabbalah'', 1517)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* ''Johannes Reuchlin and the Campaign to Destroy Jewish Books'', by [[David H.

It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.\n\nApart from its widespread usage, the Br\u00e9guet 14 is known for being the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of metal, rather than wood, in its structure. This allowed the [[airframe]] to be lighter than a wooden airframe of the same strength, in turn making the aircraft relatively fast and agile for its size; in combat it was able to outrun many contemporary [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The Br\u00e9guet 14's strong construction allowed it to sustain considerable damage, in addition to being easy to handle and possessing favourable performance. The type has often been considered to have been one of the best aircraft of the war.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Louis Br\u00e9guet]].<ref name = \"bru noe 3\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 3.</ref> Br\u00e9guet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and advanced aerodynamic test apparatus, including the [[Br\u00e9guet-Richet Gyroplane]], which held the distinction of being the first direct-lift aircraft in the world. Br\u00e9guet had been a pioneer in the field of all-metal construction, which he had employed on a successful series of [[biplane]]s during the pre-war years; these principles were used in the design of the Br\u00e9guet 14.<ref name = \"bru noe 3 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 quickly led to large numbers of Br\u00e9guet-built aircraft being inducted into the military air services of several nations, including many of the nations in the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Br\u00e9guet flew as a military pilot early on in the war and soon recognised there was demand for aircraft fitted with more powerful engines to carry worthwhile payloads over anything beyond short distances. For his next design, he opted to abandon his favoured [[tractor configuration]] in favour of a [[pusher configuration]] to better satisfy the inflexible requirements issued by the French general staff, which sought an unobstructed frontal view to benefit the observer.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1915, the French Ministry of War held a competition, seeking to determine the most suitable type of aircraft to carry a bombload of 300 lb at a speed of 120 km/h over a minimum distance of 600 km.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Following an extensive evaluation, Br\u00e9guet's submission to the contest, [[Br\u00e9guet Bre.4|SN-3]]; reportedly, a major reason for its selection over more powerful rivals was its use of the desired pusher configuration. The SN-3 would be developed into the [[Br\u00e9guet Type IV]], V, and VI, which would be built in large quantities for military use.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nIn spite of the preference of French officials for the pusher configuration, Br\u00e9guet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 4 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> During June 1916, he decided to initiate work on a new design for a military two-seater aircraft, the Br\u00e9guet AV Type XIV. According to aviation authors J. M. Bruce and Jean Noel, the [[French Army]]'s ''Section Technique de l' A\u00e9ronautique'' (S.T.A\u00e9.) received early information on the design and recommended that Br\u00e9guet power it using a 200 hp engine by [[Hispano-Suiza]].<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> Br\u00e9guet found that the engine would be incapable of delivering the desired performance, instead insisting on the adoption of a 12-cylinder [[Renault]]-built engine that had powered the previous Br\u00e9guet Type V.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet Type XIV was both a practical and aesthetically pleasing design.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> A distinctive characteristic of the Type XIV was its rectangular frontal radiator, as well as the shape of is cowling and the negative-stagger of its mainplanes.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> It possessed a sturdy [[landing gear|undercarriage]], along with two-part [[aileron]]s on the upper wing only. On the prototype, the lower wing reportedly featured [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] along the [[trailing edge]]s, that partly emulated the manner of operation of [[Aileron#Single acting ailerons|\"single-acting ailerons\"]] in only \"coming up\" from their \"down\" position at rest, as the aircraft accelerated during takeoff; these possessed a limited angle of depression and were not directly controlled by the pilot, instead being actuated by a set of 12 adjustable [[rubber]] [[bungee cord|bungee]] cords.<ref name = \"bru noe 5 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe airframe was composed primarily of [[duralumin]], invented in Germany by [[Alfred Wilm]] a decade earlier; many sections, such as the duralumin [[longeron]]s and spacers, were attached using [[welding|welded]] [[steel]]-tube fittings and braced using [[piano]] wire. The wing's main [[spar (aeronautics)|spar]] was of rectangular duralumin tubes complete with either [[oak]] or [[ash]] lining-pieces at the attachment points and sheet steel sheaths around the spars.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> The box-unit wooden [[rib]]s had fretted [[plywood]] webs and ash flanges. The surfaces of the tail unit used welded steel tube structures; while the elevators featured horn balances.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> During its design phase, French officials were wary of the Type XIV's structure, having made such an extensive use of the relatively new metal duralumin that it was claimed to be the first aircraft in the world to combine extensive use of the metal with oxy-welded joints.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Into flight===\nOn 21 November 1916, the first [[prototype]] conducted its [[maiden flight]], flown by Br\u00e9guet.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 6.</ref> The first flight had confirmed Br\u00e9guet's opinion that the Renault engine was more suitable for the type; on 30 November 1916, he informed the S.T.A\u00e9 of this determination and of the comparably worse performance of their recommended engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 11 January 1917, Br\u00e9guet informed the S.T.A\u00e9 that the prototype had reached the point where he considered it to be representative of production-standard aircraft. Later that month, it participated in further trials and by 7 February 1917, the S.T.A\u00e9 had issued a report declaring that the prototype had attained an air speed of 172 km/h at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\nDuring November 1916, the S.T.A\u00e9. had issued its requirements for four new aircraft types. Br\u00e9guet submitted his new design for two of those categories - [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[medium bomber|bomber]]. Following its evaluation during February 1917, the Br\u00e9guet 14 had been accepted to perform both roles. On 22 February 1917, Br\u00e9guet pressed the S.T.A\u00e9 for a production order to be issued for the type; on 2 March, he declared that production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] had been prepared for quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Br\u00e9guet, calling for 150  ''Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2''; a follow-on order for a further 100 aircraft was received on 4 April.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Mass production and further development===\nBy March 1917, several orders had been placed, calling for a combined 150 reconnaissance aircraft and 100 bombers \"Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2\" and \"14 B.2\" respectively (in 1918, it was written as ''Br\u00e9guet XIV A2/B2''). The A.2 variant was equipped with an array of [[camera]]s, while some were also provisioned with [[radio]]s, while the lower wing of the 14 B.2 was modified to accommodate bomb racks (built by [[Michelin]]), capable of housing up to thirty-two 115 mm bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> To avoid the bomb racks conflicting with operation of the flaps, a small forward extension of the wings was added; another modification was the installation of transparent panels to the sides of the observer's cockpit to aid in the operation of the [[bomb sight]].<ref name = \"bru noe 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1917, French authorities had expressed a high level of confidence in the type in the form of a substantial expansion of the type's production.<ref name = \"bru noe 6 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 25 April, French aviation company [[Darracq]] was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, another 50 were ordered from [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des avions Henri & Maurice Farman]]; on 18 June, [[Paul Schmitt]] was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Br\u00e9guet 14 until 1918.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Following the war, a handful of aircraft were constructed in French military-owned workshops in [[Indo-China]], albeit these are likely to have been reliant on spare parts.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nAs an insurance against engine shortages, alternative engines to use in place of the standard Renault powerplant were fitted on some aircraft, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> An improved model of the standard engine, referred to as the Renault 12Ff, appeared in Summer 1918 and was used on some later-built aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> Another engine adopted was built by French automotive company [[Lorraine-Dietrich]], which was lighter but produced less power than the Renault unit. A number of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[United States|American]] Br\u00e9guet 14s were outfitted with the [[Fiat A.12]] engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 8 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> A number of later-built B2 models were equipped with the U.S.-built [[Liberty engine]]; to distinguish these aircraft, they were denoted as the ''Br\u00e9guet 14 B2 Ls''.<ref name = \"bru noe 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nOther minor variants of the Br\u00e9guet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the 14 B.1 long-range single-seat bomber, the 14 GR.2 long-range reconnaissance, the 14 H [[floatplane]], the 14 S [[air ambulance]] and the 14 Et.2 [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].<ref name = \"bru noe 10\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 10.</ref> Later variants, such as the 14bis A2 and 14bis B2, featured improved wings. An improved variant equipped with enlarged wings was produced as the [[Br\u00e9guet 16|16]]. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the two-seat fighter [[Br\u00e9guet 17|17]], which would only be built in small numbers due to its late arrival.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 8.</ref> Production of the base Br\u00e9guet 14 continued long after the end of the war, finally ending in 1926.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Breguet 14 - Front.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14 at the Air Service, United States Army Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, France, 1918]]\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was taken on in quantity by the French Air Force. At its peak, the type equipped at least 71 escadrilles of the service, and was deployed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> For its actions during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]], the ''Section Artillerie Lourde'', equipped with the type, received a [[citation]] and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German [[Spring Offensive]]. Om 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie flying the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Many 14A2 and 14B2s were used in the conflict and were subject to considerable modification, particularly to respond to increasing German opposition to Allied Air operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 7 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFollowing its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was also ordered in quantity by the [[Belgian Army]] (40 aircraft) and the [[United States Army Air Service]] (over 600 aircraft).<ref name = \"bru noe 10 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with [[Fiat A.12]] engines due to shortages of the original [[Renault 12F]]. Prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the Br\u00e9guet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type had reportedly been responsible for dropping a combined total of 1,887,600 kg (or 1,854 tons) of bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn one of its more atypical deployments, a Br\u00e9guet 14 played a role in one of the last actions of the war. During November 1918, the aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from [[Tergnier]] and [[Spa]]; it was covered in larger white flags of truce to avoid being engaged.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\"/>\n\nThe type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/> A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated \"14 TOE\" (''Th\u00e9atres des Operations Ext\u00e9rieures''). These saw service in putting down uprisings in [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]], in [[Vietnam]] and in the French intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.\n\nOther air arms using the type included [[Brazilian Air Force|Brazil]] (30), [[Republic of China Air Force|China]] (70), [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovakia]] (10), [[Danish Air Force|Denmark]], [[Finnish Air Force|Finland]] (38), [[Greek Air Force|Greece]], [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japan]], the [[Thailand|Siamese Air Force]], Uruguay (9) and [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]]. The [[Polish Air Force]] used 158 Br\u00e9guet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. In Japan, Br\u00e9guet 14s were licence-built by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nWeeks after the signing of the Armistic, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was used to conduct several long distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> On 26 January 1919, a double-crossing of the [[Mediterranean]] was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from [[Lyon]] to [[Rome]] and then to [[Nice]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Br\u00e9guet 14, flying from [[Paris]] to [[Kenitra]], [[Morocco]], a distance of 1,900 km, in 11 hours 15 minutes.

It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.\n\nApart from its widespread usage, the Br\u00e9guet 14 is known for being the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of metal, rather than wood, in its structure. This allowed the [[airframe]] to be lighter than a wooden airframe of the same strength, in turn making the aircraft relatively fast and agile for its size; in combat it was able to outrun many contemporary [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The Br\u00e9guet 14's strong construction allowed it to sustain considerable damage, in addition to being easy to handle and possessing favourable performance. The type has often been considered to have been one of the best aircraft of the war.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Louis Br\u00e9guet]].<ref name = \"bru noe 3\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 3.</ref> Br\u00e9guet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and advanced aerodynamic test apparatus, including the [[Br\u00e9guet-Richet Gyroplane]], which held the distinction of being the first direct-lift aircraft in the world. Br\u00e9guet had been a pioneer in the field of all-metal construction, which he had employed on a successful series of [[biplane]]s during the pre-war years; these principles were used in the design of the Br\u00e9guet 14.<ref name = \"bru noe 3 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 quickly led to large numbers of Br\u00e9guet-built aircraft being inducted into the military air services of several nations, including many of the nations in the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Br\u00e9guet flew as a military pilot early on in the war and soon recognised there was demand for aircraft fitted with more powerful engines to carry worthwhile payloads over anything beyond short distances. For his next design, he opted to abandon his favoured [[tractor configuration]] in favour of a [[pusher configuration]] to better satisfy the inflexible requirements issued by the French general staff, which sought an unobstructed frontal view to benefit the observer.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1915, the French Ministry of War held a competition, seeking to determine the most suitable type of aircraft to carry a bombload of 300 lb at a speed of 120 km/h over a minimum distance of 600 km.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Following an extensive evaluation, Br\u00e9guet's submission to the contest, [[Br\u00e9guet Bre.4|SN-3]]; reportedly, a major reason for its selection over more powerful rivals was its use of the desired pusher configuration. The SN-3 would be developed into the [[Br\u00e9guet Type IV]], V, and VI, which would be built in large quantities for military use.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nIn spite of the preference of French officials for the pusher configuration, Br\u00e9guet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 4 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> During June 1916, he decided to initiate work on a new design for a military two-seater aircraft, the Br\u00e9guet AV Type XIV. According to aviation authors J. M. Bruce and Jean Noel, the [[French Army]]'s ''Section Technique de l' A\u00e9ronautique'' (S.T.A\u00e9.) received early information on the design and recommended that Br\u00e9guet power it using a 200 hp engine by [[Hispano-Suiza]].<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> Br\u00e9guet found that the engine would be incapable of delivering the desired performance, instead insisting on the adoption of a 12-cylinder [[Renault]]-built engine that had powered the previous Br\u00e9guet Type V.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet Type XIV was both a practical and aesthetically pleasing design.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> A distinctive characteristic of the Type XIV was its rectangular frontal radiator, as well as the shape of is cowling and the negative-stagger of its mainplanes.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> It possessed a sturdy [[landing gear|undercarriage]], along with two-part [[aileron]]s on the upper wing only. On the prototype, the lower wing reportedly featured [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] along the [[trailing edge]]s, that partly emulated the manner of operation of [[Aileron#Single acting ailerons|\"single-acting ailerons\"]] in only \"coming up\" from their \"down\" position at rest, as the aircraft accelerated during takeoff; these possessed a limited angle of depression and were not directly controlled by the pilot, instead being actuated by a set of 12 adjustable [[rubber]] [[bungee cord|bungee]] cords.<ref name = \"bru noe 5 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe airframe was composed primarily of [[duralumin]], invented in Germany by [[Alfred Wilm]] a decade earlier; many sections, such as the duralumin [[longeron]]s and spacers, were attached using [[welding|welded]] [[steel]]-tube fittings and braced using [[piano]] wire. The wing's main [[spar (aeronautics)|spar]] was of rectangular duralumin tubes complete with either [[oak]] or [[ash]] lining-pieces at the attachment points and sheet steel sheaths around the spars.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> The box-unit wooden [[rib]]s had fretted [[plywood]] webs and ash flanges. The surfaces of the tail unit used welded steel tube structures; while the elevators featured horn balances.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> During its design phase, French officials were wary of the Type XIV's structure, having made such an extensive use of the relatively new metal duralumin that it was claimed to be the first aircraft in the world to combine extensive use of the metal with oxy-welded joints.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Into flight===\nOn 21 November 1916, the first [[prototype]] conducted its [[maiden flight]], flown by Br\u00e9guet.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 6.</ref> The first flight had confirmed Br\u00e9guet's opinion that the Renault engine was more suitable for the type; on 30 November 1916, he informed the S.T.A\u00e9 of this determination and of the comparably worse performance of their recommended engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 11 January 1917, Br\u00e9guet informed the S.T.A\u00e9 that the prototype had reached the point where he considered it to be representative of production-standard aircraft. Later that month, it participated in further trials and by 7 February 1917, the S.T.A\u00e9 had issued a report declaring that the prototype had attained an air speed of 172 km/h at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\nDuring November 1916, the S.T.A\u00e9. had issued its requirements for four new aircraft types. Br\u00e9guet submitted his new design for two of those categories - [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[medium bomber|bomber]]. Following its evaluation during February 1917, the Br\u00e9guet 14 had been accepted to perform both roles. On 22 February 1917, Br\u00e9guet pressed the S.T.A\u00e9 for a production order to be issued for the type; on 2 March, he declared that production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] had been prepared for quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Br\u00e9guet, calling for 150  ''Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2''; a follow-on order for a further 100 aircraft was received on 4 April.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Mass production and further development===\nBy March 1917, several orders had been placed, calling for a combined 150 reconnaissance aircraft and 100 bombers \"Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2\" and \"14 B.2\" respectively (in 1918, it was written as ''Br\u00e9guet XIV A2/B2''). The A.2 variant was equipped with an array of [[camera]]s, while some were also provisioned with [[radio]]s, while the lower wing of the 14 B.2 was modified to accommodate bomb racks (built by [[Michelin]]), capable of housing up to thirty-two 115 mm bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> To avoid the bomb racks conflicting with operation of the flaps, a small forward extension of the wings was added; another modification was the installation of transparent panels to the sides of the observer's cockpit to aid in the operation of the [[bomb sight]].<ref name = \"bru noe 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1917, French authorities had expressed a high level of confidence in the type in the form of a substantial expansion of the type's production.<ref name = \"bru noe 6 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 25 April, French aviation company [[Darracq]] was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, another 50 were ordered from [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des avions Henri & Maurice Farman]]; on 18 June, [[Paul Schmitt]] was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Br\u00e9guet 14 until 1918.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Following the war, a handful of aircraft were constructed in French military-owned workshops in [[Indo-China]], albeit these are likely to have been reliant on spare parts.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nAs an insurance against engine shortages, alternative engines to use in place of the standard Renault powerplant were fitted on some aircraft, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> An improved model of the standard engine, referred to as the Renault 12Ff, appeared in Summer 1918 and was used on some later-built aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> Another engine adopted was built by French automotive company [[Lorraine-Dietrich]], which was lighter but produced less power than the Renault unit. A number of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[United States|American]] Br\u00e9guet 14s were outfitted with the [[Fiat A.12]] engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 8 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> A number of later-built B2 models were equipped with the U.S.-built [[Liberty engine]]; to distinguish these aircraft, they were denoted as the ''Br\u00e9guet 14 B2 Ls''.<ref name = \"bru noe 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nOther minor variants of the Br\u00e9guet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the 14 B.1 long-range single-seat bomber, the 14 GR.2 long-range reconnaissance, the 14 H [[floatplane]], the 14 S [[air ambulance]] and the 14 Et.2 [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].<ref name = \"bru noe 10\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 10.</ref> Later variants, such as the 14bis A2 and 14bis B2, featured improved wings. An improved variant equipped with enlarged wings was produced as the [[Br\u00e9guet 16|16]]. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the two-seat fighter [[Br\u00e9guet 17|17]], which would only be built in small numbers due to its late arrival.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 8.</ref> Production of the base Br\u00e9guet 14 continued long after the end of the war, finally ending in 1926.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Breguet 14 - Front.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14 at the Air Service, United States Army Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, France, 1918]]\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was taken on in quantity by the French Air Force. At its peak, the type equipped at least 71 escadrilles of the service, and was deployed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> For its actions during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]], the ''Section Artillerie Lourde'', equipped with the type, received a [[citation]] and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German [[Spring Offensive]]. Om 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie flying the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Many 14A2 and 14B2s were used in the conflict and were subject to considerable modification, particularly to respond to increasing German opposition to Allied Air operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 7 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFollowing its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was also ordered in quantity by the [[Belgian Army]] (40 aircraft) and the [[United States Army Air Service]] (over 600 aircraft).<ref name = \"bru noe 10 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with [[Fiat A.12]] engines due to shortages of the original [[Renault 12F]]. Prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the Br\u00e9guet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type had reportedly been responsible for dropping a combined total of 1,887,600 kg (or 1,854 tons) of bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn one of its more atypical deployments, a Br\u00e9guet 14 played a role in one of the last actions of the war. During November 1918, the aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from [[Tergnier]] and [[Spa]]; it was covered in larger white flags of truce to avoid being engaged.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\"/>\n\nThe type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/> A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated \"14 TOE\" (''Th\u00e9atres des Operations Ext\u00e9rieures''). These saw service in putting down uprisings in [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]], in [[Vietnam]] and in the French intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.\n\nOther air arms using the type included [[Brazilian Air Force|Brazil]] (30), [[Republic of China Air Force|China]] (70), [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovakia]] (10), [[Danish Air Force|Denmark]], [[Finnish Air Force|Finland]] (38), [[Greek Air Force|Greece]], [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japan]], the [[Thailand|Siamese Air Force]], Uruguay (9) and [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]]. The [[Polish Air Force]] used 158 Br\u00e9guet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. In Japan, Br\u00e9guet 14s were licence-built by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nWeeks after the signing of the Armistic, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was used to conduct several long distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> On 26 January 1919, a double-crossing of the [[Mediterranean]] was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from [[Lyon]] to [[Rome]] and then to [[Nice]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Br\u00e9guet 14, flying from [[Paris]] to [[Kenitra]], [[Morocco]], a distance of 1,900 km, in 11 hours 15 minutes. Aviation pioneer [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]] had one example of the type converted to conduct experimental [[in-flight refuelling]] operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 13 14\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n[[File:Breguet 14T bis ambulance L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14T bis Sanitaire photo from L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921]]\nDuring the postwar years, Br\u00e9guet decided to commence manufacture of dedicated civil versions of the Br\u00e9guet 14. The 14 T.2 Salon carried two passengers in a specially modified fuselage. An improved version of this was the 14 Tbis, manufactured as both a land-plane and [[seaplane]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200780.html \"1921 Paris Air Salon: Br\u00e9guet 14Tbis.\"] ''Flight'', 24 November 1921.</ref> The 14 Tbis also formed the basis of the improved 14 Tbis Sanitaire air ambulance version, and 100 [[mail plane]]s custom-built for Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re's fledgling airline, [[Lignes Aeriennes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 13.</ref> After changing its name to \"CGEA\", the airline used, among others, 106 Br\u00e9guet 14s for flights over the [[Sahara]] Desert.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref>http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230092433/http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm |date=2006-12-30 }} State of Maine Civil War Records Website</ref> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref>http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230092433/http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm |date=2006-12-30 }} State of Maine Civil War Records Website</ref> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

Fette Engschrift is a single weight of the DIN 1451 typeface.]]\nThe DIN 1451 typeface family includes both a medium (''Mittelschrift'') and a condensed (''Engschrift'') version; an older extended version (''Breitschrift'') is no longer used since the early 1980s, but may still be encountered on older road signs in Germany. DIN 1451 is the typeface used on road signage in Germany and a number of other countries. It was also used on [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|German car number plates]] from 1956, until replaced there in January 1995 by [[FE-Schrift]], a typeface especially designed to make the plates more tamper-proof and to optimize automatic character recognition. The typeface has gained popularity due to its wide exposure through its release as a [[PostScript Type 1|PostScript]] typeface in 1990. Since then, it is also used by non-governmental organisations and businesses. For graphic design and desktop publishing, several [[Type foundry|type foundries]] offer redesigned and extended versions of this typeface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Autobahn A9 Autobahndreieck Bayerisches Vogtland 1700 m from south.jpg|thumb|right|German road signs using both the DIN 1451 Mittelschrift (left) and Engschrift (right) typefaces]]\nIn 1931, the DIN institute published DIN 1451. It contained several standard typefaces for mechanically engraved lettering, hand-lettering, lettering stencils and printing types. These were to be used in the areas of signage, traffic signs, wayfinding, lettering on technical drawings and technical documentation.\n\nThe origins of DIN 1451 ''Engschrift'' (\"condensed face\") for hand lettering date back to 1905, when the [[Prussian state railways]] prescribed a standardized lettering style for use on all of its rolling stock. This specification was published in a document known as ''Musterzeichnung'' (\"Master Template\"; lit. \"pattern drawing\") ''IV 44.'' Ten years later, the company \u2013 by then, renamed [[Prussian state railways|Prussian-Hessian Railways]] \u2013 additionally required that signage lettering on railway platforms and station premises also be rendered according to the 1905 master template. Then, as a byproduct of the 1920 consolidation of all German railway companies into the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]], the Prussian railway's typeface quickly became a ''de facto'' national standard, even before the DIN Committee of Typefaces took up its work on DIN 1451 a few years later. The DIN Committee of Typefaces was headed by the Siemens engineer, Ludwig Goller (1884\u20131964), who also led the central standardization office at [[Siemens & Halske]] in Berlin, between 1920 and 1945.\n\n{{multiple image\n | caption_align= left\n | header_align=center\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = thumb\n | header = Signs at the town of [[Eisingen]] in Engschrift, Mittelschrift and Breitschrift\n | image1 = Ortsschild Eisingen DIN-Engschrift.jpg\n | alt1 = Engschrift (narrow letters)\n | image2 = Ortsschild Eisingen DIN-Mittelschrift.jpg\n | alt2 = Mittelschrift (normal-width letters)\n | image3 = Ortsschild Eisingen DIN-Breitschrift.jpg\n | alt3 = Breitschrift (wide letters)\n}}\nThe design included not only the DIN ''Engschrift,'' but also a DIN ''Mittelschrift'' (\"medium[-width] face\" \u2013 now very popular). A DIN ''Breitschrift'' (\"extended face\") design was also included, but it has never been widely used.\n\nIn order to enable quick and easy reproduction, all drawings were originally based on a coarse grid and could be executed with compass and rulers. The ''Normblatt'' (\"standards sheet\") DIN 1451, ''Schriften'' (\"Typefaces\") was released preliminarily in 1931; then, with some minor changes in 1936, it was released as an official standard. In 1938, Temporary Order No. 20 required DIN 1451 to be used on the new German ''[[German autobahns|Autobahn]]'' (motorway) system. Due to this and similar regulations, DIN 1451 still dominates German public lettering today.\n\n[[File:Justus Erich Walbaum Stra\u00dfe im Geburtsort Steinlah.jpg|thumb|Stencilled and DIN-style lettering on a street sign in [[Steinlah]], a district of [[Haverlah]]]]\nIn 1923, [[D Stempel AG|Stempel]] was the first type foundry to produce printing type according to a DIN Standard. The design follows [[List of DIN standards#DIN 1 to DIN 99|DIN 16]], an earlier standard for oblique lettering on technical drawings, which had been released in 1919. In 1929, the [[Berthold Type Foundry]] released a similar typeface. DIN 16 had also been made available as lettering templates engraved in celluloid material for drafting use by the Filler and Fiebig company in [[Berlin]].\n\n[[File:Stencils01.jpg|thumb|right|Stencils for lettering technical drawings to DIN standards]]\nWithin the scope of public and [[technical lettering]], the use of the DIN 1451 typefaces spread rapidly once they were adopted. They were released as [[celluloid]] lettering stencils for smaller applications, as larger metal stencils for application to machinery, vehicles and airplanes, and as cast metal lettering for street and building signage; nevertheless, printing type conforming to DIN 1451 have never been produced. During [[World War II]], DIN 1451 was also adopted in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The 1943 version of DIN 1451 added a set of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] characters, although their design did not match the weight and proportions of DIN ''Mittelschrift.''\n\nSans-serif lettering and typefaces styled around geometric shapes, along with [[Art Deco]] in general, was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. At the [[Bauhaus]], the use of coarse grids for designing typefaces was advocated by [[Herbert Bayer]] and [[Joost Schmidt]] during the Dessau period. Although of a similar design, the DIN typefaces did not incorporate the elegance of this stylistic trend.\n\nInspired by the DIN standard, a consortium of Dutch organisations created an equivalent lettering standard, NEN 3225.<ref name=\"Middendorp2004\">{{cite book|author=Jan Middendorp|title=Dutch Type|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sR9g5xPPJVQC&pg=PA298|year=2004|publisher=010 Publishers|isbn=978-90-6450-460-0|pages=298\u20139}}</ref> Created by a group of designers that included [[Jan van Krimpen]], the design has no similarity to the DIN standard: it is a humanist family with serif and sans-serif styles. The sans-serif is similar to [[Gill Sans]] and to [[Johnston (typeface)|Johnston]]; the serif reflects the classical Renaissance humanist model.<ref name=\"NEN 3225 Ovink\">{{cite book|author1=G. Willem Ovink|title=Alphabet|date=1964|publisher=Kynoch Press|pages=123-130|chapter=NEN 3225: Dutch Standard Alphabets}}</ref>\n\n== Releases ==\n[[File:DIN Mittelschrift Beispiel.jpg|thumb|A sign in an older version of DIN Mittelschrift. Note the different structure of the 'a' and how curved strokes do not thin as they connect, as at the join of the 'h'.]]\n\nThe transferable-lettering-sheet company, [[Letraset]] made several variants available in the 1970s. Also, the [[Berthold Type Foundry|Berthold]] type foundry adopted the DIN typefaces for their optomechanical [[Phototypesetting|phototype setting]] systems such as Staromat. In 1980, the DIN typefaces were redrawn by Adolf Gropp (1911\u20131996), a lettering artist from [[Frankfurt]]. The drawings were made on a finer grid. This enabled an exact definition of details such as the amount of overshoot of round characters (e.g. C, G and O) below the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] and above the [[cap height]]. Also, characters such as S for which an accurate construction drawing had never been made were now defined using lines and arcs for the new [[Plotter|cutting plotters]] that were to be used for the lettering on motorway signage. A number of the [[glyph]]s were changed, in particular those for \"a\", \"6\" and \"9\" as well as \"t\" in DIN Engschrift.\n\nBy the mid 1980s, [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] adopted the redrawn DIN typefaces for digital photocomposition. Together with [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], they released it as DIN Mittelschrift and DIN Engschrift in 1990. Thus, the typefaces became part of the Adobe/Linotype PostScript typeface library. The use of DIN typefaces started to appear in the work of cutting edge graphic designers and design studios such as Uwe Loesch in Germany, Tel Design in the Netherlands, as well as [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[April Greiman]] in the USA. Soon, other leading designers began using DIN Mittelschrift and Engschrift, making it a popular option to other sans serif faces.\n\n==Third-party adaptations==\n[[File:Albert-Jan Pool (8757464729).jpg|thumb|[[Albert-Jan Pool]], author of one of the most famous adaptations of DIN, [[FF DIN]], speaking about the design's history<ref name=\"typotag 2013\">{{cite web|title=Albert-Jan Pool - K\u00f6nnen Serifen funktional sein?

DIN 1451 is the typeface used on road signage in Germany and a number of other countries. It was also used on [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|German car number plates]] from 1956, until replaced there in January 1995 by [[FE-Schrift]], a typeface especially designed to make the plates more tamper-proof and to optimize automatic character recognition. The typeface has gained popularity due to its wide exposure through its release as a [[PostScript Type 1|PostScript]] typeface in 1990. Since then, it is also used by non-governmental organisations and businesses. For graphic design and desktop publishing, several [[Type foundry|type foundries]] offer redesigned and extended versions of this typeface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Autobahn A9 Autobahndreieck Bayerisches Vogtland 1700 m from south.jpg|thumb|right|German road signs using both the DIN 1451 Mittelschrift (left) and Engschrift (right) typefaces]]\nIn 1931, the DIN institute published DIN 1451. It contained several standard typefaces for mechanically engraved lettering, hand-lettering, lettering stencils and printing types. These were to be used in the areas of signage, traffic signs, wayfinding, lettering on technical drawings and technical documentation.\n\nThe origins of DIN 1451 ''Engschrift'' (\"condensed face\") for hand lettering date back to 1905, when the [[Prussian state railways]] prescribed a standardized lettering style for use on all of its rolling stock. This specification was published in a document known as ''Musterzeichnung'' (\"Master Template\"; lit. \"pattern drawing\") ''IV 44.'' Ten years later, the company \u2013 by then, renamed [[Prussian state railways|Prussian-Hessian Railways]] \u2013 additionally required that signage lettering on railway platforms and station premises also be rendered according to the 1905 master template. Then, as a byproduct of the 1920 consolidation of all German railway companies into the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]], the Prussian railway's typeface quickly became a ''de facto'' national standard, even before the DIN Committee of Typefaces took up its work on DIN 1451 a few years later. The DIN Committee of Typefaces was headed by the Siemens engineer, Ludwig Goller (1884\u20131964), who also led the central standardization office at [[Siemens & Halske]] in Berlin, between 1920 and 1945.\n\n{{multiple image\n | caption_align= left\n | header_align=center\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = thumb\n | header = Signs at the town of [[Eisingen]] in Engschrift, Mittelschrift and Breitschrift\n | image1 = Ortsschild Eisingen DIN-Engschrift.jpg\n | alt1 = Engschrift (narrow letters)\n | image2 = Ortsschild Eisingen DIN-Mittelschrift.jpg\n | alt2 = Mittelschrift (normal-width letters)\n | image3 = Ortsschild Eisingen DIN-Breitschrift.jpg\n | alt3 = Breitschrift (wide letters)\n}}\nThe design included not only the DIN ''Engschrift,'' but also a DIN ''Mittelschrift'' (\"medium[-width] face\" \u2013 now very popular). A DIN ''Breitschrift'' (\"extended face\") design was also included, but it has never been widely used.\n\nIn order to enable quick and easy reproduction, all drawings were originally based on a coarse grid and could be executed with compass and rulers. The ''Normblatt'' (\"standards sheet\") DIN 1451, ''Schriften'' (\"Typefaces\") was released preliminarily in 1931; then, with some minor changes in 1936, it was released as an official standard. In 1938, Temporary Order No. 20 required DIN 1451 to be used on the new German ''[[German autobahns|Autobahn]]'' (motorway) system. Due to this and similar regulations, DIN 1451 still dominates German public lettering today.\n\n[[File:Justus Erich Walbaum Stra\u00dfe im Geburtsort Steinlah.jpg|thumb|Stencilled and DIN-style lettering on a street sign in [[Steinlah]], a district of [[Haverlah]]]]\nIn 1923, [[D Stempel AG|Stempel]] was the first type foundry to produce printing type according to a DIN Standard. The design follows [[List of DIN standards#DIN 1 to DIN 99|DIN 16]], an earlier standard for oblique lettering on technical drawings, which had been released in 1919. In 1929, the [[Berthold Type Foundry]] released a similar typeface. DIN 16 had also been made available as lettering templates engraved in celluloid material for drafting use by the Filler and Fiebig company in [[Berlin]].\n\n[[File:Stencils01.jpg|thumb|right|Stencils for lettering technical drawings to DIN standards]]\nWithin the scope of public and [[technical lettering]], the use of the DIN 1451 typefaces spread rapidly once they were adopted. They were released as [[celluloid]] lettering stencils for smaller applications, as larger metal stencils for application to machinery, vehicles and airplanes, and as cast metal lettering for street and building signage; nevertheless, printing type conforming to DIN 1451 have never been produced. During [[World War II]], DIN 1451 was also adopted in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The 1943 version of DIN 1451 added a set of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] characters, although their design did not match the weight and proportions of DIN ''Mittelschrift.''\n\nSans-serif lettering and typefaces styled around geometric shapes, along with [[Art Deco]] in general, was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. At the [[Bauhaus]], the use of coarse grids for designing typefaces was advocated by [[Herbert Bayer]] and [[Joost Schmidt]] during the Dessau period. Although of a similar design, the DIN typefaces did not incorporate the elegance of this stylistic trend.\n\nInspired by the DIN standard, a consortium of Dutch organisations created an equivalent lettering standard, NEN 3225.<ref name=\"Middendorp2004\">{{cite book|author=Jan Middendorp|title=Dutch Type|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sR9g5xPPJVQC&pg=PA298|year=2004|publisher=010 Publishers|isbn=978-90-6450-460-0|pages=298\u20139}}</ref> Created by a group of designers that included [[Jan van Krimpen]], the design has no similarity to the DIN standard: it is a humanist family with serif and sans-serif styles. The sans-serif is similar to [[Gill Sans]] and to [[Johnston (typeface)|Johnston]]; the serif reflects the classical Renaissance humanist model.<ref name=\"NEN 3225 Ovink\">{{cite book|author1=G. Willem Ovink|title=Alphabet|date=1964|publisher=Kynoch Press|pages=123-130|chapter=NEN 3225: Dutch Standard Alphabets}}</ref>\n\n== Releases ==\n[[File:DIN Mittelschrift Beispiel.jpg|thumb|A sign in an older version of DIN Mittelschrift. Note the different structure of the 'a' and how curved strokes do not thin as they connect, as at the join of the 'h'.]]\n\nThe transferable-lettering-sheet company, [[Letraset]] made several variants available in the 1970s. Also, the [[Berthold Type Foundry|Berthold]] type foundry adopted the DIN typefaces for their optomechanical [[Phototypesetting|phototype setting]] systems such as Staromat. In 1980, the DIN typefaces were redrawn by Adolf Gropp (1911\u20131996), a lettering artist from [[Frankfurt]]. The drawings were made on a finer grid. This enabled an exact definition of details such as the amount of overshoot of round characters (e.g. C, G and O) below the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] and above the [[cap height]]. Also, characters such as S for which an accurate construction drawing had never been made were now defined using lines and arcs for the new [[Plotter|cutting plotters]] that were to be used for the lettering on motorway signage. A number of the [[glyph]]s were changed, in particular those for \"a\", \"6\" and \"9\" as well as \"t\" in DIN Engschrift.\n\nBy the mid 1980s, [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] adopted the redrawn DIN typefaces for digital photocomposition. Together with [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], they released it as DIN Mittelschrift and DIN Engschrift in 1990. Thus, the typefaces became part of the Adobe/Linotype PostScript typeface library. The use of DIN typefaces started to appear in the work of cutting edge graphic designers and design studios such as Uwe Loesch in Germany, Tel Design in the Netherlands, as well as [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[April Greiman]] in the USA. Soon, other leading designers began using DIN Mittelschrift and Engschrift, making it a popular option to other sans serif faces.\n\n==Third-party adaptations==\n[[File:Albert-Jan Pool (8757464729).jpg|thumb|[[Albert-Jan Pool]], author of one of the most famous adaptations of DIN, [[FF DIN]], speaking about the design's history<ref name=\"typotag 2013\">{{cite web|title=Albert-Jan Pool - K\u00f6nnen Serifen funktional sein?
