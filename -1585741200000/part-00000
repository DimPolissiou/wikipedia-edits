Bayati poetry is known for its reflective and introspective prose.

The Turkish version boy encounters the girl in [[Erzurum]] market and suggests that she is from [[Paland\u00f6ken]] mountain. The Armenian version girl is \"sari\" (from the mountain). and the Azarbaijani version boy calls the girl \"tallest in the valley\" and \"sheperd\".\n* '''The girl is blond'''. In Azerbaijani and Turkish versions \"Sari\" means yellow. in the Azerbaijani version, where the story is about a Muslim boy in love with a Christian girl, It makes sense for \"Sari\" to mean blond, as it is a notable characteristic among predominantly dark haired people.<ref name=\"Azerbaijani\"/>\n* '''The girl is tall''', as Azerbaijani \"uzunu\" (the tallest) and Turkish \"suna\" (male duck. here: tall and beautiful) correspond.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/>\n* '''The boy says \"aman!\"'''. The Arabic word \"aman\" (secure me / help / please) is an exclamation of lasting pain and long distress.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/> It is used in Azerbaijani \"neynim aman, aman\" (what do I do? please!), Turkish \"Leylim aman\" (my Leyli, please!) and Armenian \"dle aman\" (my heart, please!).\n* '''The boy and the girl are apart''' as told in Azerbaijani story, Azerbaijani line \"seni mene vermezler\" (They won't give you to me / let me marry you),<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/> Armenian ''Sari Gyalin'' line \"I could not have the one I loved\". Turkish line \"I won't give you [up] to others\" and In Armenian ''Sari Aghjik'' line \"She left and chose someone else\".\n* '''The girl is called ''[[Layla and Majnun|Leyli]]''''' in Turkish line \"leylim aman aman\" (my leyli, please!) and the Armenian ''Sari Aghjik'' line \"Leyli janin yar\" (Leyla dear beloved). but this particular line is a Persian phrase referring to ''Layla'' the famous beloved. This can mean:\n** The girl is beloved, as Leyli is the famous object of desire.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/>\n** The girl's name is Leyli.\n** The girl is insanely loved, but is impossible to get; especially if similarity to [[Romeo & Juliet]] is noticed, as widely done by Turks.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/>\n* '''The boy says \"may your grandmother die\"''' in Armenian and Turkish versions.

The Turkish version boy encounters the girl in [[Erzurum]] market and suggests that she is from [[Paland\u00f6ken]] mountain. The Armenian version girl is \"sari\" (from the mountain). and the Azarbaijani version boy calls the girl \"tallest in the valley\" and \"sheperd\".\n* '''The girl is blond'''. In Azerbaijani and Turkish versions \"Sari\" means yellow. in the Azerbaijani version, where the story is about a Muslim boy in love with a Christian girl, It makes sense for \"Sari\" to mean blond, as it is a notable characteristic among predominantly dark haired people.<ref name=\"Azerbaijani\"/>\n* '''The girl is tall''', as Azerbaijani \"uzunu\" (the tallest) and Turkish \"suna\" (male duck. here: tall and beautiful) correspond.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/>\n* '''The boy says \"aman!\"'''. The Arabic word \"aman\" (secure me / help / please) is an exclamation of lasting pain and long distress.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/> It is used in Azerbaijani \"neynim aman, aman\" (what do I do? please!), Turkish \"Leylim aman\" (my Leyli, please!) and Armenian \"dle aman\" (my heart, please!).\n* '''The boy and the girl are apart''' as told in Azerbaijani story, Azerbaijani line \"seni mene vermezler\" (They won't give you to me / let me marry you),<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/> Armenian ''Sari Gyalin'' line \"I could not have the one I loved\". Turkish line \"I won't give you [up] to others\" and In Armenian ''Sari Aghjik'' line \"She left and chose someone else\".\n* '''The girl is called ''[[Layla and Majnun|Leyli]]''''' in Turkish line \"leylim aman aman\" (my leyli, please!) and the Armenian ''Sari Aghjik'' line \"Leyli janin yar\" (Leyla dear beloved). but this particular line is a Persian phrase referring to ''Layla'' the famous beloved. This can mean:\n** The girl is beloved, as Leyli is the famous object of desire.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/>\n** The girl's name is Leyli.\n** The girl is insanely loved, but is impossible to get; especially if similarity to [[Romeo & Juliet]] is noticed, as widely done by Turks.<ref name=\"Chris Gratien\"/>\n* '''The boy says \"may your grandmother die\"''' in Armenian and Turkish versions.

Upon Rome's declining influence, during 3rd\u20134th centuries the area became inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s. A few centuries later [[Christianization|Christianized]] assumedly by the Irish or Scottish missionary [[Rumbold of Mechelen|St Rumbold]] (''Rombout'' in Dutch) who was also said to have built a monastery. Work on the cathedral that is dedicated to the saint started around 1200.\n\nAntwerp lost profitable ''stapelrechten'' (rights as first seller) for wool, oats and salt to Mechelen in 1303 when [[John II, Duke of Brabant|John II]], [[Duke of Brabant]], granted [[City rights]] to the town. This started a rivalry between these cities that would last well into the 20th century.\n\n=== 15th Century and beyond ===\nIn the 15th century, the city came under the rule of the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]], marking the beginning of a prosperous period. In 1473 [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] moved several political bodies to the city, and Mechelen served as the seat of the Superior Court until the [[French Revolution]]. In 1490, a regular postal service between Mechelen and [[Innsbruck]] was established.\n\nThe highly lucrative cloth trade gained Mechelen wealth and power during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and it even became the capital of the [[Low Countries]] (very roughly the [[Netherlands]], Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]) in the first half of the 16th century under [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria]].\n\nDuring the 16th century the city's political influence decreased dramatically, due to many governmental institutions being moved to [[Brussels]]. Mechelen compensated for this by increasing prominence in the religious arena: in 1559 it was proclaimed the [[Archdiocese of Mechelen]], seat of religious authority over the territory that would eventually become Belgium. In 1961, \"Brussels\" was added to the title, resulting in the current [[Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels]].\n\nMechelen also retained further relevance as the [[Great Council of Mechelen]] remained the supreme court of the territory until the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. In 1572, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city was burned and sacked by the Spanish. After this pillaging, the city was rebuilt. It was sacked again in 1580  during the [[English Fury at Mechelen]]. It was during this time that the tradition of furniture making, still seen today, began.\n\nIn 1718 a major rebellion took place in the city, angry mobs entered the town hall. During this time Lord [[Pierre de Romr\u00e9e]] was mayor of Mechelen. The chaos ended when the Emperor formally requested the President of the [[Great Council of Mechelen|Great Council]] to restore peace. On 18 June, [[Christophe-Ernest, 1st Count of Baillet|Christophe-Ernest de Baillet]] received a full list of the people who led the troubles. The President received the support of multiple regiments that had been sent by imperial command. Ten persons were arrested during the night, however this failed{{confusing|date=August 2017}} and the people managed to pursue the rebellion. After negotiations de Baillet restored peace and order in the city.<ref>Noord en Zuid: Maendschrift voor Kunsten, letteren en wetenschappen, Volume 2</ref>\n\nIn 1781, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], ordered the destruction of the city's fortified walls \u2013 their former location however continues to be referred to in the Latin terms ''intra muros'' (within the walls) and ''extra muros'' (outside), and meanwhile the site became that of the inner ring road.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Map created c.1781 to depict which strategical defence structures had to be broken down \n |publisher=beeldbankmechelen.be \n |url=http://www.beeldbankmechelen.be/index.php?option=com_memorix&topid=8&collection_id=1&data_id=2620&photo_id=10663 \n |accessdate=2 February 2007 \n |language=nl \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818175029/http://www.beeldbankmechelen.be/index.php?option=com_memorix&topid=8&collection_id=1&data_id=2620&photo_id=10663 \n |archivedate=18 August 2007 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nThe city entered the industrial age in the 19th century. In 1835, the first railway on the European continent linked [[Brussels]] with Mechelen, which became the hub of the Belgian railway network.<ref>http://www.trainworld.be/en/collections/history-of-the-belgian-railways/2-belgium-on-track-19th-century</ref> This led to a development of metalworking industries, among others the central railway workshops which are still located in the town today. During the Second World War, the extensive Mechlinian<ref group =\"n\" name=\"cityname\"/> railway  structure had caused the [[Nazi]] occupation forces to choose Mechelen for their [[Mechelen transit camp|infamous transit camp]]. Over 25,000 [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] were sent by rail to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] extermination camp from Mechelen. The site of the transit camp now houses the [[Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance]].\n\nSeveral famous meetings on the Christian religion are connected to the name of the city. One in 1909 is thought to have inaugurated the [[Liturgical Movement]]. Between 1921 and 1925 a series of unofficial conferences, known as the [[Malines Conversations]],<ref group =\"n\" name=\"cityname\"/> presided over by [[Cardinal Mercier]] and attended by Anglican divines and laymen, including [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], was the most significant of early attempts at the reconciliation between the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] and Roman Catholic Churches.\n\n== Folklore ==\n[[File:Mechelen Neptunus 02.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] in Mechelen. The statue is also called Vadderik (lazy fat man). It is part of a water fountain erected in 1718. It was made by [[Frans Langhemans]], a sculptor from Mechelen, at the behest of the city council. The inscription reads [[SPQR|SPQM]] or Senatus Populusque Mechliensis (the council and population of Mechlin).]]\n\nMost cities in Flanders have a mock name for their inhabitants. Since 1687, for their heroic attempt to fight the ''fire'' high up in the Saint-Rumbold's Tower, where the gothic windows had shown the flaring of only the moon between clouds, Mechlinians have been called ''Maneblussers'' (moon extinguishers).\n\nOnce every 25 years, a [[Parade]], the [[Ommegang]], commemorates both the arrival of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], father of [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria]], and also other major events of the city's past. The ''Ommegang'' had an extra edition in 2000 for the 500th anniversary of the birth of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. This cortege shows the city's six 15th\u201317th-century Giants and other serious and humoresque puppets and carts, all typically made on a huge scale, and has been [[UNESCO]] [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] since 2005.\n\nThe city's 17th-century wooden mascot, which since 1775 has been called ''Opsinjoorke'' 'the doll', is pulled about on a sheet as part of the Ommegang. Nowadays, it is the replica that is so pulled around the city. A recent bronze statue depicting the ''Opsinjoorke'' stands in front of the Belfry.\n\nThe annual parade of carts decorated with flowers (comparable to that of [[Blankenberge]] for Mechlinian florists still prepare up to half of decorations), and with vegetables, \u2013 all of which are local to the area\u2014has been indefinitely canceled since the beginning of the 21st century due to lack of financing by the City.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=G4AHB8FL ,,Bloemencorso moet terugkomen\" ''Afgevoerde Mechelse bloementraditie leeft voort in Blankenberge''] journal Het Nieuwsblad, 26 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn spring, a legendary holy statue of Our Lady is the main feature in the Procession of Hanswijk.\n\n==Dialect==\nInformally, many Mechlinians ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''Mechelaars'', locally pronounced ''Mecheleirs'') speak Mechlinian (''Mechels''), a Dutch dialect which is distinct from other [[Brabantic]] dialects.\n\nSince 1995, a subscribers' quarterly,'' De Mecheleir, '' shows old photographs of Mechelen and has stories on the local history, as well as a few columns written mimicking the dialect, for which there is no standard spelling.<ref>''De Mecheleir'' vzw Mechelen 2000+, subscribers' quarterly published by J.

The [[Dyle (river)|Dyle]] ({{lang-nl|Dijle}}) flows through the city, hence it is often referred to as the ''{{lang|nl|Dijlestad}}'' (\"City on the river {{lang|nl|Dijle}}\").\n\nMechelen lies on the [[Flemish Diamond|major urban and industrial axis]] [[Brussels]]\u2013[[Antwerp]], about 25&nbsp;km from each city. Inhabitants find employment at Mechelen's southern industrial and northern office estates, as well as at offices or industry near the capital and [[Zaventem Airport]], or at industrial plants near Antwerp's seaport.\n\nMechelen is one of Flanders' prominent cities of historical art, with [[Antwerp]], [[Bruges]], [[Brussels]], [[Ghent]], and [[Leuven]].

Upon Rome's declining influence, during 3rd\u20134th centuries the area became inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s. A few centuries later [[Christianization|Christianized]] assumedly by the Irish or Scottish missionary [[Rumbold of Mechelen|St Rumbold]] (''Rombout'' in Dutch) who was also said to have built a monastery. Work on the cathedral that is dedicated to the saint started around 1200.\n\nAntwerp lost profitable ''stapelrechten'' (rights as first seller) for wool, oats and salt to Mechelen in 1303 when [[John II, Duke of Brabant|John II]], [[Duke of Brabant]], granted [[City rights]] to the town. This started a rivalry between these cities that would last well into the 20th century.\n\n=== 15th Century and beyond ===\nIn the 15th century, the city came under the rule of the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]], marking the beginning of a prosperous period. In 1473 [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] moved several political bodies to the city, and Mechelen served as the seat of the Superior Court until the [[French Revolution]]. In 1490, a regular postal service between Mechelen and [[Innsbruck]] was established.\n\nThe highly lucrative cloth trade gained Mechelen wealth and power during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and it even became the capital of the [[Low Countries]] (very roughly the [[Netherlands]], Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]) in the first half of the 16th century under [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria]].\n\nDuring the 16th century the city's political influence decreased dramatically, due to many governmental institutions being moved to [[Brussels]]. Mechelen compensated for this by increasing prominence in the religious arena: in 1559 it was proclaimed the [[Archdiocese of Mechelen]], seat of religious authority over the territory that would eventually become Belgium. In 1961, \"Brussels\" was added to the title, resulting in the current [[Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels]].\n\nMechelen also retained further relevance as the [[Great Council of Mechelen]] remained the supreme court of the territory until the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. In 1572, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city was burned and sacked by the Spanish. After this pillaging, the city was rebuilt. It was sacked again in 1580  during the [[English Fury at Mechelen]]. It was during this time that the tradition of furniture making, still seen today, began.\n\nIn 1718 a major rebellion took place in the city, angry mobs entered the town hall. During this time Lord [[Pierre de Romr\u00e9e]] was mayor of Mechelen. The chaos ended when the Emperor formally requested the President of the [[Great Council of Mechelen|Great Council]] to restore peace. On 18 June, [[Christophe-Ernest, 1st Count of Baillet|Christophe-Ernest de Baillet]] received a full list of the people who led the troubles. The President received the support of multiple regiments that had been sent by imperial command. Ten persons were arrested during the night, however this failed{{confusing|date=August 2017}} and the people managed to pursue the rebellion. After negotiations de Baillet restored peace and order in the city.<ref>Noord en Zuid: Maendschrift voor Kunsten, letteren en wetenschappen, Volume 2</ref>\n\nIn 1781, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], ordered the destruction of the city's fortified walls \u2013 their former location however continues to be referred to in the Latin terms ''intra muros'' (within the walls) and ''extra muros'' (outside), and meanwhile the site became that of the inner ring road.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Map created c.1781 to depict which strategical defence structures had to be broken down \n |publisher=beeldbankmechelen.be \n |url=http://www.beeldbankmechelen.be/index.php?option=com_memorix&topid=8&collection_id=1&data_id=2620&photo_id=10663 \n |accessdate=2 February 2007 \n |language=nl \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818175029/http://www.beeldbankmechelen.be/index.php?option=com_memorix&topid=8&collection_id=1&data_id=2620&photo_id=10663 \n |archivedate=18 August 2007 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nThe city entered the industrial age in the 19th century. In 1835, the first railway on the European continent linked [[Brussels]] with Mechelen, which became the hub of the Belgian railway network.<ref>http://www.trainworld.be/en/collections/history-of-the-belgian-railways/2-belgium-on-track-19th-century</ref> This led to a development of metalworking industries, among others the central railway workshops which are still located in the town today. During the Second World War, the extensive Mechlinian<ref group =\"n\" name=\"cityname\"/> railway  structure had caused the [[Nazi]] occupation forces to choose Mechelen for their [[Mechelen transit camp|infamous transit camp]]. Over 25,000 [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] were sent by rail to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] extermination camp from Mechelen. The site of the transit camp now houses the [[Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance]].\n\nSeveral famous meetings on the Christian religion are connected to the name of the city. One in 1909 is thought to have inaugurated the [[Liturgical Movement]]. Between 1921 and 1925 a series of unofficial conferences, known as the [[Malines Conversations]],<ref group =\"n\" name=\"cityname\"/> presided over by [[Cardinal Mercier]] and attended by Anglican divines and laymen, including [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], was the most significant of early attempts at the reconciliation between the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] and Roman Catholic Churches.\n\n== Folklore ==\n[[File:Mechelen Neptunus 02.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] in Mechelen. The statue is also called Vadderik (lazy fat man). It is part of a water fountain erected in 1718. It was made by [[Frans Langhemans]], a sculptor from Mechelen, at the behest of the city council. The inscription reads [[SPQR|SPQM]] or Senatus Populusque Mechliensis (the council and population of Mechlin).]]\n\nMost cities in Flanders have a mock name for their inhabitants. Since 1687, for their heroic attempt to fight the ''fire'' high up in the Saint-Rumbold's Tower, where the gothic windows had shown the flaring of only the moon between clouds, Mechlinians have been called ''Maneblussers'' (moon extinguishers).\n\nOnce every 25 years, a [[Parade]], the [[Ommegang]], commemorates both the arrival of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], father of [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria]], and also other major events of the city's past. The ''Ommegang'' had an extra edition in 2000 for the 500th anniversary of the birth of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. This cortege shows the city's six 15th\u201317th-century Giants and other serious and humoresque puppets and carts, all typically made on a huge scale, and has been [[UNESCO]] [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] since 2005.\n\nThe city's 17th-century wooden mascot, which since 1775 has been called ''Opsinjoorke'' 'the doll', is pulled about on a sheet as part of the Ommegang. Nowadays, it is the replica that is so pulled around the city.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other, nonfictional literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1952\u201363), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1927\u201333). Dali also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dali soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dali narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dali avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dali praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dali's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dali was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dali frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dali said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dali's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dali's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDali was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

Dali was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dali's father died in September 1950 Dali learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dali had left in his family home, during which Dali was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dali moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted s study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss his marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dali dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dali soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dali narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dali avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dali praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dali's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dali was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dali frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dali said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dali's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dali's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDali was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.
