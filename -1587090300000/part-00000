Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

When the city was younger and smaller, the June 1853 edition of the ''West American Review'', \"Article III\u2014Cincinnati: Its Relations to the West and South\" described and named seven specific hills.  The hills form a crescent around the city: [[Mount Adams, Ohio|Mount Adams]], [[Walnut Hills, Cincinnati|Walnut Hills]], [[Mount Auburn, Cincinnati, Ohio|Mount Auburn]], Vine Street Hill, College Hill, Fairmont (now rendered Fairmount), and Mount Harrison (now known as Price Hill). The name refers to ancient Rome, reputed to be built on seven hills.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

O'Donnell has also performed in [[The Psychedelic Furs]], [[Thompson Twins]] and [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], as well as having an active solo career.\n\n== Background ==\nO'Donnell was born in East London into a musical family, next to the piano in his parents' London home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerodonnell.com/info.html |title=\"Info\" at |publisher=Rogerodonnell.com |accessdate=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907025500/http://www.rogerodonnell.com/info.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> O'Donnell attended art school but left to pursue a career as a professional musician, with his first paying gig coming in 1976, at [[Oxford Town Hall]] backing legendary British pop icon [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]].\n\nO'Donnell joined the [[Thompson Twins]] as a live keyboardist in July 1983, playing alongside future [[The Cure|Cure]] bandmate and drummer [[Boris Williams]]. Both completed the Side Kicks Tour in 1983 and also played with the band on the Into the Gap/Out of the Gap tours in 1984. In the early 1980s, while with the Thompson Twins, [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], and the [[Psychedelic Furs]], O'Donnell was a big fan of synthesisers produced by [[Sequential Circuits]], which produced such classics as the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet 5|Prophet 5]], Prophet T8, and Prophet VS. While on tour with the Psychedelic Furs, O'Donnell set the record for having the most Sequential models onstage at one time.\n\n==Career==\n\n===The Cure===\nO'Donnell first joined The Cure in 1987, after being longtime friends with drummer [[Boris Williams]]. He played with The Cure during their ''[[Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me]]'' tour, though he did not contribute to the album. (He does however appear in the music videos for \"[[Just Like Heaven (song)|Just Like Heaven]]\" and \"[[Hot Hot Hot!!!]]\" and appeared in tour promo art.) With O'Donnell on keyboards, [[Porl Thompson]] was able to focus on guitar full-time, instead of assisting Tolhurst on keyboards for many of the songs. Some of O'Donnell's performances from this tour can be heard on the deluxe edition of ''[[Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me]]''.\n\nFor the next album ''[[Disintegration (The Cure album)|Disintegration]]'', O'Donnell became a fully integrated member of the band, and his songwriting contributions can be heard on the songs \"Out of Mind\" and \"Fear of Ghosts,\" which are the [[A-side and B-side|B-Side]]s to the hit singles \"Lullaby\" and \"Lovesong\", respectively. He is also featured on the live album from this period, ''[[Entreat]]''. Following The Cure's Prayer Tour in 1989, O'Donnell left the band in 1990.\n\nDuring the period of the Cure's greatest success, O'Donnell was the band's only member to play piano and keyboards as his primary instrument. Previous keyboardist [[Lol Tolhurst]] also played drums for a time and subsequent keyboardist [[Perry Bamonte]] later switched to guitar. O'Donnell rejoined The Cure in late 1994 and appeared on the albums ''[[Wild Mood Swings]]'', ''[[Bloodflowers]]'', and ''[[The Cure (The Cure album)|The Cure]]''. He also appears on the live DVD ''[[The Cure: Trilogy]]''. During this period it is notable that O'Donnell introduced the band to digital recording.\n\nWhen O'Donnell started working on his solo album ''The Truth in Me'' in early 2005, he stated that he had no plans to leave The Cure. However, later in that year [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] decided to reconfigure The Cure as a trio, without O'Donnell or [[Perry Bamonte]]. O'Donnell would later confirm that the rumour of him being fired by E-mail was false, and if The Cure hadn't been reduced to a trio he would have left regardless to concentrate on solo material.\n\nIn May 2011, O'Donnell and Laurence Tolhurst reunited with The Cure to perform the band's first three albums \u2013 ''Three Imaginary Boys'', ''Seventeen Seconds'', and ''Faith'' \u2013 in their entirety at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia. The set also included a number of B-sides and singles played during the [[encore (concert)|encore]]. On 11 September O'Donnell announced on his Facebook page that he had rejoined [[The Cure]].\n\n===Solo work===\nO'Donnell's current solo career commenced when he was asked to submit a song for a documentary being made about Bob Moog, \"Moog\". This was in early 2004 whilst he was still a member of [[The Cure]]. Later that year whilst helping to promote the film with its producer Ryan Page at the Sheffield Documentary Festival, conversation led to the suggestion that O'Donnell should write an entire album of music composed and recorded in the same way as the song \"Another Year Away\". The song was composed entirely and performed solely on a [[Minimoog Voyager]].\n\nLater that year and into early 2005 when work with The Cure had ended O'Donnell completed the project which was to become \"[[The Truth in Me]]\" the album released in 2006.\n\nIn summer 2005, O'Donnell and his longtime partner and collaborator [[Erin Lang]] formed their own label with the idea of supporting and encouraging otherwise unsignable artists, mainly in the electronic genre, and releasing their own music. The first release was in September 2005, a sampler \"Nothing Concrete\" featuring songs from 10 unsigned artists. The label is called 99 Times Out of 10 or 99X/10.\n\nIn discussions to find a distributor in the US Roger was offered a record deal with independent label group Worlds Fair on their new [[Warner Brothers]] distributed label Great Society.\n\nO'Donnell released two albums with Great Society, \"[[The Truth in Me]]\" in 2006 and \"Songs Form The Silver Box\" in 2009. Both featuring [[Erin Lang]] on vocals with a special guest appearance from Australian singer [[Lenka]] on the latter. An EP of remixes was also released from \"[[The Truth in Me]]\" featuring versions by [[Dntel]], [[Kieran Hebden|Fourtet]] and [[Console (musician)|Console]] all very highly regarded artists in the electronic field.\n\nRoger's association with World's Fair and Great Society came to an end in 2009 when the label folded. All of his and [[Erin Lang]]'s future releases will be handled by 99X/10.\n\nFuture projects nearing completion as of Spring 2010 are a collection of songs for piano, cello and voice entitled Two/Three \u2013 Before. The trio features O'Donnell on piano, [[Erin Lang]], vocals and longtime friend Paul van Dongen on cello. A preview concert performance in Toronto in February 2010 with the Corktown Chamber Orchestra led to another project which O'Donnell has composed for the orchestra, Quieter Trees.\n\nQuieter Trees is a group of six songs inspired by a painting by British artist [[David Hockney]] \"[[Bigger Trees Near Warter]]\". It was performed in London Morley College by the [[Centre for Young Musicians]] on 2 July 2011 and it will be performed in November in [[Toronto]] this time with O'Donnell playing piano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerodonnell.com/news.html |title=Roger O'Donnell News |publisher=Rogerodonnell.com |accessdate=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907025508/http://www.rogerodonnell.com/news.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter having been introduced to [[Adam Donen]] in late 2011 the two decided to collaborate on a work for a small ensemble of violin, viola,  two celli, French horn, woodwinds and two female voices. Entitled Requiem, it celebrated the life of Richard Dawkins. Performed once only at St Leonards Church in Shoreditch East London. The pair went on to work on a suite for Chamber orchestra entitled Bernhard inspired by the literary works of [[Thomas Bernhard]]. It was performed by the Wurttemberg Chamber Orchestra in Germany and again in London at the Cadogan Halls in Chelsea.\n\nIn June 2015, O'Donnell released a solo album 'Love and Other Tragedies' featuring Julia Kent of Anthony and the Johnsons on cello.\n\nO\u2019Donnell also guest starred in the Australian Comedy Show \u201cThese New South Wales\u201d based on the Australian Punk Band.\n\n===Solo===\n*''Grey Clouds, Red Sky'', previously unreleased instrumental solo album recorded in 1994.

Thompson Twins became a duo (following the departure of [[Joe Leeway]]) and had recorded a song for the film ''[[Nothing in Common]]'' starring [[Tom Hanks]] and featuring the last ever performance by [[Jackie Gleason]]. The video for the song of the same name as the movie was shot on location in Chicago, with Hanks making a cameo appearance playing drums.

The song was composed entirely and performed solely on a [[Minimoog Voyager]].\n\nLater that year and into early 2005 when work with The Cure had ended O'Donnell completed the project which was to become \"[[The Truth in Me]]\" the album released in 2006.\n\nIn summer 2005, O'Donnell and his longtime partner and collaborator [[Erin Lang]] formed their own label with the idea of supporting and encouraging otherwise unsignable artists, mainly in the electronic genre, and releasing their own music. The first release was in September 2005, a sampler \"Nothing Concrete\" featuring songs from 10 unsigned artists. The label is called 99 Times Out of 10 or 99X/10.\n\nIn discussions to find a distributor in the US Roger was offered a record deal with independent label group Worlds Fair on their new [[Warner Brothers]] distributed label Great Society.\n\nO'Donnell released two albums with Great Society, \"[[The Truth in Me]]\" in 2006 and \"Songs Form The Silver Box\" in 2009. Both featuring [[Erin Lang]] on vocals with a special guest appearance from Australian singer [[Lenka]] on the latter. An EP of remixes was also released from \"[[The Truth in Me]]\" featuring versions by [[Dntel]], [[Kieran Hebden|Fourtet]] and [[Console (musician)|Console]] all very highly regarded artists in the electronic field.\n\nRoger's association with World's Fair and Great Society came to an end in 2009 when the label folded. All of his and [[Erin Lang]]'s future releases will be handled by 99X/10.\n\nFuture projects nearing completion as of Spring 2010 are a collection of songs for piano, cello and voice entitled Two/Three \u2013 Before. The trio features O'Donnell on piano, [[Erin Lang]], vocals and longtime friend Paul van Dongen on cello. A preview concert performance in Toronto in February 2010 with the Corktown Chamber Orchestra led to another project which O'Donnell has composed for the orchestra, Quieter Trees.\n\nQuieter Trees is a group of six songs inspired by a painting by British artist [[David Hockney]] \"[[Bigger Trees Near Warter]]\". It was performed in London Morley College by the [[Centre for Young Musicians]] on 2 July 2011 and it will be performed in November in [[Toronto]] this time with O'Donnell playing piano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerodonnell.com/news.html |title=Roger O'Donnell News |publisher=Rogerodonnell.com |accessdate=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907025508/http://www.rogerodonnell.com/news.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter having been introduced to [[Adam Donen]] in late 2011 the two decided to collaborate on a work for a small ensemble of violin, viola,  two celli, French horn, woodwinds and two female voices.

The pair went on to work on a suite for Chamber orchestra entitled Bernhard inspired by the literary works of [[Thomas Bernhard]]. It was performed by the Wurttemberg Chamber Orchestra in Germany and again in London at the Cadogan Halls in Chelsea.\n\nIn June 2015, O'Donnell released a solo album 'Love and Other Tragedies' featuring Julia Kent of Anthony and the Johnsons on cello.\n\nO\u2019Donnell also guest starred in the Australian Comedy Show \u201cThese New South Wales\u201d based on the Australian Punk Band.\n\n===Solo===\n*''Grey Clouds, Red Sky'', previously unreleased instrumental solo album recorded in 1994.

The Shades moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where the band's name changed to \"Little Daddy & the Bachelors\". They recorded a single, \"Too Much Monkey Business\" / \"Junior's Jerk\". Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before. Although Little Daddy & the Bachelors built up a small following, things soured when they went with Chong's suggestion and had themselves billed as \"Four [[Nigger]]s and a [[Chink]]\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Andrew|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p130602|title=Bobby Taylor|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> (or, bowing to pressure, \"Four N's and a C\") before taking on the moniker [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1965, the Vancouvers signed with Gordy Records (a subsidiary of Detroit's [[Motown Records]]). They recorded their debut album, an [[eponymous]] release, and their debut single, the Tommy Chong co-composition, \"Does Your Mama Know About Me,\" which peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> While on tour in Chicago for a short time, the band followed opening act [[the Jackson 5]].

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy.

When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that \"Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOf the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain. She said, \"He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other.\"<ref name=\"Tommy Chong's Bongs\">{{cite magazine |author=Greg Beato | title=Tommy Chong's Bongs| date=May 2004 | magazine= Reason Magazine| url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/29137.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring its investigation of Nice Dreams, federal agents posed as head-shop owners from [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] in western Pennsylvania. They asked Paris Chong to sell them [[Water pipe percolator|pipes]] through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], {{convert|31|mi|km}} from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in [[Western Pennsylvania]] because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chong's prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defense, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chong's illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled ''[[The Marijuana-Logues]]'', a parody of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.

Around this same time, Cheech and Chong appeared together on the internet-based, pro-marijuana show, [[Getting Doug With High]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1960, Chong married Maxine Sneed in Canada.

Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before.

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig.

He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company.

The series centers around the adventures of a young, pink alien hero named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] as he fights to save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformers]] with puzzle solving and [[beat 'em up]] elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he eats certain things he can gain the powers or properties of that object manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with [[action game]]s, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.\n\nThe ''Kirby'' series includes a total of over [[List of Kirby games|twenty games]], and has sold over 34 million units worldwide, putting it in the top 50 best-selling video game franchises of all time.\n\nHungy pink boi\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|\n| range1 = 1992 -\n| range1_color = #FFB6C1 #DB7093\n| 1992 = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'''''\n| 1993a = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'''''\n| 1993b = ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]''\n| 1994 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]''\n| 1995a = ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]''\n| 1995b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'''''\n| 1995c = ''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]''\n| 1996 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star]]'''''\n| 1997a =  ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]''\n| 1997b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'''''\n| 1998 = ''[[Kirby's Super Star Stacker]]''\n| 2000a = '''''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'''''\n| 2000b = ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]''\n| 2002 = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2003 = ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''\n| 2004 = '''''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'''''\n| 2005 = '''''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'''''\n| 2006 = '''''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'''''\n| 2008 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'''''\n| 2010 = '''''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2011a = '''''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'''''\n| 2011b = '''''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2012 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]''\n| 2014a = '''''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'''''\n| 2014b = ''[[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]]''\n| 2014c = ''[[Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe]]''\n| 2015 = '''''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'''''\n| 2016 = '''''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'''''\n| 2017a = ''[[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Kirby's Blowout Blast]]''\n| 2017c = ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]''\n| 2018b = '''''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'''''\n| 2019a =  '''''[[Kirby\u2019s Extra Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2019b = ''Super Kirby Clash''\n}}\n\n===1990s===\nThe first game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the original [[Game Boy]], was released in Japan in April 1992 and later in North America in August that year. A simple game, consisting of five levels, it introduced Kirby's ability to inhale enemies and objects. The game contains an unlockable hard mode, known as the \"Extra Game\", which features stronger enemies and more difficult bosses. The North American box art showed a white Kirby, although the Japanese box art had the correct pink coloring.\n\nThe second game, ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', was released in North America in May 1993. ''Kirby's Adventure'' gave Kirby the ability to gain special powers when he ate certain enemies, called Copy Abilities; the game contained a total of 25 different ones to use. These powers replaced Kirby's inhale and could be used until Kirby sustained damage causing him to drop the ability, or the player voluntarily discarded it to obtain another one. As one of the last games created for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''Kirby's Adventure'' featured advanced graphics and sound that pushed the hardware's capabilities to the limit, including pseudo 3D effects on some stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/adventure/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014|quote=It featured better than ever NES graphics, a big variety of tunes and extras galore to keep all ages glued to this classic game.}}</ref> It was re-released in 2002 on the [[Game Boy Advance]], retitled as ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', featuring updated graphics and sound, multiplayer support, and the ability to play as [[Meta Knight]].\n\nAfter ''Kirby's Adventure'', the ''Kirby'' series received a number of spin-off games. ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', released in November 1993, is a pinball game featuring Kirby as the pinball. ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'', released in North America in February 1995, is a [[golf]]-based game which features an isometric graphic design. ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', released in February 1995 in North America and Europe, is a puzzle game, a westernized version of the Japanese game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', released in Japan and North America in March 1995, brought the Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure'' to a handheld system, but due to system limitations lowered the number of abilities to seven. The game introduced three rideable animal companions: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the ocean sunfish. Pairing up with any of these three alters how Kirby's abilities work. The game was to be remade for the [[Game Boy Color]] as ''Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX'', but was cancelled.\n\n''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]'', released in November 1995 in North America, is a [[Breakout clone|variation]] of the game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', featuring multiple levels, some of Kirby's Copy Abilities, and various enemies in unique boss battles.\n\n''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', known as ''Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe'' in Japan and ''Kirby's Fun Pak'' in Europe, was released in North America in September 1996. ''Kirby Super Star'' is composed of eight separate games, and features several characters and abilities which have not appeared since in the series. The game features \"Helpers\", which can be created by sacrificing the ability in use, to help the player dispatch enemies.\n\nIn 1996, a ''Kirby'' mini-game series, {{nihongo foot|''Kirby's Toy Box'',|\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u7bb1|K\u0101b\u012b no Omocha Hako|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released via the [[St.GIGA]] satellite broadcasting system for the [[Satellaview]].

The game received a sequel on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1998 in Japan as ''[[Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', released in November 1997 in North America, is a direct sequel to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', as it featured the return of Kirby's animal friends. Similarly to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' features a few Copy Abilities which were modified when Kirby paired up with one of his six animal friends. The game had a multiplayer option with the second player controlling Gooey, a recurring character. The antagonist is Dark Matter, and if certain conditions are met, Zero was fought as the true final boss. The game had a unique pastel-drawing art style and used dithering to improve visual performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=Kirby's Dreamland 3 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/01/06/kirbys-dream-land-3-review|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=January 6, 2009|quote=Kirby's Dream Collection 3 (...) employed an advanced-for-the-time dithering effect to enhance the visuals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/dreamland3/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe first game to have 3D graphics in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] in North America in June 2000. The game features a compound ability system that allows two of the seven abilities in the game to be merged, making a new compound ability. It also marked the first playable instance of King Dedede, where sections of some stages had Kirby riding piggyback while King Dedede attacked enemies and obstacles with his hammer. It is considered a direct follow-up to ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' due to the reemergence of Dark Matter and the final boss, albeit in a different form, called 0<sup>2</sup> (Zero Two). It also included three four-player minigames.\n\nThe next game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' became one of Nintendo's first motion-sensor-based games in August 2000. Players are instructed to tilt the Game Boy Color to move Kirby on the screen. Quickly flicking the Game Boy Color upwards would make Kirby jump into the air. ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble'' is the only ''Kirby'' game to have a special cartridge color (transparent pink) in North America.\n\nThe only ''Kirby'' game for the [[GameCube]], ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', was released in North America in October 2003. It is a racing game which deviates greatly from usual ''Kirby'' titles, although still featuring series staples including enemies and Copy Abilities.\n\nDuring the 2003 Holiday season, a Kirby [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-reader card]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] was released. The card was released under two names, ''Kirby Slide'' and ''Kirby Puzzle''. Swiping the card would allow for a sliding puzzle game starring Kirby to be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEC30bnj0cU|title=Kirby Puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Cards were given out at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] stores and in the 2003 December issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Tips & Tricks (magazine)|Tips & Tricks]]''. The game was released to advertise the English dub of ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]''\n\n''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'' was released in October 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the second game released on that system, following ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It features Kirby in a [[Metroidvania]] format, with all the levels being interconnected and able to be completed in any order. Also unique was the in-game phone, which can be used to summon up to three additional copies of Kirby to fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe next game in the series is ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'', released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan on March 24, 2005, North America on June 13, 2005, Europe on November 25, 2005, and Australia on April 6, 2006. Unlike most previous ''Kirby'' games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a [[D-pad|directional pad]], [[analog stick]], face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, Kirby is a helpless ball, and can only move when he gains momentum, the player painting paths with the stylus to direct his movement.\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'' in late 2006, also on the Nintendo DS, which revived traditional ''Kirby'' gameplay and dabbled in the use of the touch screen to store several items and Copy Abilities in Kirby's stomach. Ability scrolls could be found that served as upgrades for each ability, giving them additional moves and/or enhanced functionality. An unlockable Copy Ability was also introduced.\n\n''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', announced for the Nintendo DS in early fall 2007<ref>{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=October 11, 2007 |title=Second Hand Hands On from Japan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/11/second-hand-hands-on-from-japan |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> and released on September 22, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/kirby-super-star-ultra/nds-14209932 |title=Kirby Super Star Ultra - Nintendo DS |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> in North America, is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star''. In addition to the nine games from ''Kirby Super Star'', seven new games have been added.

The game was released in Japan on January 11, 2014, in North America on May 2, 2014, in Europe on May 16, 2014, and in Australasia on May 17, 2014. It incorporated action spanning varied depths, where Kirby could swap between the foreground and background areas. It included a multiplayer fighting mode called \"Kirby Fighters\", where players could choose one of ten available abilities and fight on themed stages, with the winner being the last Kirby standing. It also included a rhythm-based action game starring King Dedede. There were also over 250 in-game \"keychains\" to collect that featured sprites from previous Kirby games as well some original sprites based on characters from Triple Deluxe. In August 2014, Kirby Fighters Deluxe and Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe (enhanced versions of the mini-games in Kirby: Triple Deluxe) were released.\n\nAt E3 2014, a new game for the [[Wii U]] was announced. Titled ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'', the game is a direct sequel to ''Kirby: Canvas Curse'' and features a similar gameplay style. It was released by Nintendo on January 22, 2015 in Japan, February 20, 2015 in North America, May 8, 2015 in Europe and May 9, 2015 in Australasia.\n\nIn March 2016, during a Nintendo Direct, Nintendo unveiled a new game based on the context of ''Kirby: Triple Deluxe'' called ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''.

Pupupu Land}}}} a country on Planet Popstar. Popstar resembles a [[five-pointed star]] encircled by two diagonal [[Ring system|rings]].\n\nWhile most of Kirby's adventures take place on Popstar, his journeys occasionally take place on an interplanetary scale; such as in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''Milky Way Wishes'' from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n==Nature of the protagonist==\n{{main|Kirby (character)}}\nKirby is a small, pink, spherical alien with red feet, stubby flap-like arms and pink cheek-blushes. He is referred to as male in the animated series, and described as a young boy in the instruction manual for ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch his mouth to inhale foes or inflate himself with air and float. According to ''Super Smash Bros.'' instruction manual, he is 8 inches tall; this is contradicted in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', the former of which shows Kirby to be at about [[knee]] height compared to [[Samus Aran]] and the latter of which showing him to be a few inches shorter than the human girl Adeleine.\n\nKirby hails from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, where he lives in a domed house. His appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\nKirby does not commonly speak, mainly limited to grunts, shouts, and monosyllables in such games as ''Super Smash Bros'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. However he does speak in the stories written in some games' instruction manuals. He rarely speaks in-game, the only exception being ''Kirby's Avalanche''. He narrates the functions of Copy Abilities on the start menu in ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Most in-game talking Kirby does is in ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'', where Kirby explains the game's rules and gameplay. Kirby has dialogue in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'', but it is all spoken through the game's narrator.\n\n==Other media==\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nThe ''Kirby'' series was made into an [[anime]] on October 6, 2001, originally titled ''Hoshi no Kaabii''. It was produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and HAL Laboratory, Inc. It was licensed in North America by [[4Kids Entertainment]], under the title ''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!'', on [[4Kids TV]], and was distributed by [[4Kids Entertainment]] in North America and [[Nelvana Limited]] in Canada, with VHS and DVD distributions in North America by [[FUNimation Entertainment]] and DVD distributions in Australia by [[Magna Pacific]]. It ended in Japan in 2003 with 100 episodes.\n\nThe show is about the adventures Kirby has with his friends Tiff and Tuff after he crash lands in Dream Land, on Pop Star. Here, he is a legendary Star Warrior destined to save the universe from the intergalactic conqueror known as Nightmare. However, because he was awakened 200 years too early he arrived in a childlike state and his powers haven't fully developed. The ruler of Dream Land, [[King Dedede]], is jealous of the attention Kirby receives from its inhabitants and frequently orders monsters from Nightmare's company, [[Nightmare Enterprises]], in an attempt to do away with Kirby. [[Nightmare Enterprises]] at first appears to be an intergalactic delivery company, but is really a front for Nightmare's intergalactic conquest that dupes unsuspecting customers into funding Nightmare's armies. Not yet ready to achieve his destiny, Kirby must learn how to use his incredible abilities with the help of his friends, and sometimes with the help of the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], who while he claims to be loyal to King Dedede, will often work behind the scenes in order to aid Kirby or train him in the use of his abilities.\n\nThe show is based on the game series, but rather than being a direct adaptation of any of the games it uses characters and concepts from the games (especially ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'') to tell its own story.\n\n===Comics and manga===\nKirby stars in several [[manga]] series, none of which have been released outside of Japan yet. The longest running series is ''Kirby of the Stars'' (a rough English translation of ''Hoshi no Kirby''), written by Hirokazu Hikawa. This series was announced for a release in America by VIZ Media, but was never actually released.\n\nOther ''Kirby'' manga are typically one-shot comedy [[4koma]] based on the games, and have multiple artists. They have recurring themes and [[running gag]]s.\n\nKirby also appears in several German comics, featuring him as a detective and King Dedede as his friend. His animal friends appear as pets of a female Kirby look-alike with red glass slippers. In one comic, he meets Lolo, Lala, and Lulu, the protagonists of the ''[[Adventures of Lolo]]'' series. The German comics were meant to let German ''Kirby'' fans know of ''Kirby'' games which would be released there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Cancelled games===\nIn the lifetime of the ''Kirby'' series, several video games have been in development that, for various reasons, were ultimately abandoned. Such titles include ''Kirby's Air Ride 64'' (also known as ''Kirby Bowl 64'' and ''Kirby Ball 64'') on the Nintendo 64,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Kirby Ball 64 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|page=79}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Kirby Bowl 64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1996|page=23}}</ref> which was eventually released on the GameCube as ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.\n\n''Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble 2'' on the GameCube, which was supposed to use a combination of motion-sensor technology and connectivity to the Game Boy Advance via the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]].<ref>The game was presented during the Nintendo Space World 2001</ref>\n\nThere was also a planned game called ''Kid Kirby'' that was to be released on the Super Nintendo.<ref>''Other Stuff: Nintendo News''. [[DieHard GameFan]]. Volume 3. Issue 6. Number 30. Pg.129. June 1995.</ref> The game would have served as a prequel to the series and would have utilized the SNES mouse. The game was cancelled due to the declining sales of the mouse; however, early screenshots of the cancelled game have been posted online. This unreleased game was developed by [[DMA Design]] for Nintendo and was scheduled for 1995.\n\nThough resurfaced as ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', the GameCube was initially going to have its own original Kirby game, simply titled ''Kirby Adventure'' at the time. It was nearly complete and featured at E3 2005, but was cancelled due to troubles incorporating a unique multiplayer mechanic, which became the special attack in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (where all players stack on each other, hold A and release at the same time). Most of ''Kirby Adventure'' was scrapped in the game it became to be, such as the helper system that was featured in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' which made a return in the GameCube version of the game before cancellation, as well as having faster-paced gameplay similar to ''Kirby Super Star''. Such concepts would be revitalized in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Kirby'' in other video games===\n[[File:Kirby Characters in Smash.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Meta Knight]], [[King Dedede]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]  in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]\nKirby appears as a character in Nintendo's crossover [[fighting game]] series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (also developed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai), appearing in all installments of the franchise. Starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' onwards, he's joined by [[Meta Knight]] and [[King Dedede]]. Many items from the Kirby series also appear in ''Super Smash Bros'' such as the Maxim Tomato (all games), Warp Star (since ''Melee''), Dragoon (since ''Brawl'') and Star Rod (all games) as items, and Knuckle Joe (''Brawl'' and ''3DS/Wii U''), Nightmare (''3DS/Wii U'') and Chef Kawasaki (''Ultimate'') appear as characters summoned by the Assist Trophy.

Kirby of the Stars}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] series developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The series centers around the adventures of a young, pink alien hero named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] as he fights to save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformers]] with puzzle solving and [[beat 'em up]] elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he eats certain things he can gain the powers or properties of that object manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with [[action game]]s, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.\n\nThe ''Kirby'' series includes a total of over [[List of Kirby games|twenty games]], and has sold over 34 million units worldwide, putting it in the top 50 best-selling video game franchises of all time.\n\n==Overview==\nThe main [[protagonist]] of the ''Kirby'' series is a young, spherical 8-inch-tall alien boy named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] who lives on a far away [[Five-pointed star|star]]-shaped planet called Popstar in the country of Dream Land. Much of Dream Land is peaceful and its people lead laid back and carefree lives. However, when peace in Dream Land is shattered from threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial in origin, it's up to Kirby to become a brave warrior and save his home. Despite his young and carefree personality; Kirby possesses many incredible abilities, such as the power to inhale objects and enemies, sucking them into his stretchy mouth and spitting them out with force. He can also take on the properties of enemies and objects that he eats to gain Copy Abilities, transforming into new forms and gaining new powers; such as breathing fire, wielding a sword, launching sparks in every direction, or attacking enemies with direct hand-to-hand combat.\n\nMany [[List of Kirby characters|recurring characters]] appear throughout the series both allies and enemies. The most frequent one being [[King Dedede]], a gluttonous blue penguin-like bird and self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land. King Dedede has appeared in every ''Kirby'' game except for ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. King Dedede's selfish nature often leads him and Kirby to clash, however he sometimes teams up with Kirby when a greater threat appears. Another major character of the series is the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], a chivalrous masked man who wishes to one day fight the strongest warrior in the galaxy and leads a band of like-minded warriors. Whenever he and Kirby duel, he will always offer Kirby a sword beforehand so that the fight is fair. While his true face resembles Kirby's, his exact relationship with Kirby remains a mystery.\n\nThe main ''Kirby'' games are side-scrolling action-platformers. Kirby must run, jump, and attack enemies while traversing through a number of areas, solving puzzles and fighting [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] along the way. One of the things that sets ''Kirby'' apart is Kirby's ability to inflate himself with a gulp of air and fly. In most games he can do this for as long as he likes however, his attack options are limited while doing so.\n\nKirby games often contain a number of hidden items that either unlock more parts to the game or are simple incentives to collect, and are usually required to achieve 100% completion in the game. These special items usually relate to the plot of the game, most often used to create a special weapon required to defeat the final boss. In some games, the special weapon is optional and can be used in the game regularly after defeating the final boss with it. These elements have remained constant throughout most the series, with each game having its own unique twist to affect gameplay.\n\nThe games' fantasy world of [[#Fictional universe|Popstar]] includes many regions of different climates and terrains, which are home to [[List of Kirby characters|many different creatures]]. Each game features uniquely named areas, but all games feature typical locations such as fiery mountains, open meadows, water-filled or submerged areas, icy snowfields, and similar nature-based places.\n\nThere are also several spinoff games in the series, which involve a variety of different gaming genres such as [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], puzzle, [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], a game based on motion-sensor technology. A number of these side games take advantage of Kirby's round, ball-like appearance.\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|\n| range1 = 1992 -\n| range1_color = #FFB6C1 #DB7093\n| 1992 = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'''''\n| 1993a = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'''''\n| 1993b = ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]''\n| 1994 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]''\n| 1995a = ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]''\n| 1995b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'''''\n| 1995c = ''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]''\n| 1996 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star]]'''''\n| 1997a =  ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]''\n| 1997b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'''''\n| 1998 = ''[[Kirby's Super Star Stacker]]''\n| 2000a = '''''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'''''\n| 2000b = ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]''\n| 2002 = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2003 = ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''\n| 2004 = '''''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'''''\n| 2005 = '''''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'''''\n| 2006 = '''''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'''''\n| 2008 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'''''\n| 2010 = '''''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2011a = '''''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'''''\n| 2011b = '''''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2012 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]''\n| 2014a = '''''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'''''\n| 2014b = ''[[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]]''\n| 2014c = ''[[Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe]]''\n| 2015 = '''''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'''''\n| 2016 = '''''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'''''\n| 2017a = ''[[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Kirby's Blowout Blast]]''\n| 2017c = ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]''\n| 2018b = '''''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'''''\n| 2019a =  '''''[[Kirby\u2019s Extra Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2019b = ''Super Kirby Clash''\n}}\n\n===1990s===\nThe first game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the original [[Game Boy]], was released in Japan in April 1992 and later in North America in August that year. A simple game, consisting of five levels, it introduced Kirby's ability to inhale enemies and objects. The game contains an unlockable hard mode, known as the \"Extra Game\", which features stronger enemies and more difficult bosses. The North American box art showed a white Kirby, although the Japanese box art had the correct pink coloring.\n\nThe second game, ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', was released in North America in May 1993. ''Kirby's Adventure'' gave Kirby the ability to gain special powers when he ate certain enemies, called Copy Abilities; the game contained a total of 25 different ones to use. These powers replaced Kirby's inhale and could be used until Kirby sustained damage causing him to drop the ability, or the player voluntarily discarded it to obtain another one. As one of the last games created for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''Kirby's Adventure'' featured advanced graphics and sound that pushed the hardware's capabilities to the limit, including pseudo 3D effects on some stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/adventure/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014|quote=It featured better than ever NES graphics, a big variety of tunes and extras galore to keep all ages glued to this classic game.}}</ref> It was re-released in 2002 on the [[Game Boy Advance]], retitled as ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', featuring updated graphics and sound, multiplayer support, and the ability to play as [[Meta Knight]].\n\nAfter ''Kirby's Adventure'', the ''Kirby'' series received a number of spin-off games. ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', released in November 1993, is a pinball game featuring Kirby as the pinball. ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'', released in North America in February 1995, is a [[golf]]-based game which features an isometric graphic design. ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', released in February 1995 in North America and Europe, is a puzzle game, a westernized version of the Japanese game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', released in Japan and North America in March 1995, brought the Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure'' to a handheld system, but due to system limitations lowered the number of abilities to seven. The game introduced three rideable animal companions: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the ocean sunfish. Pairing up with any of these three alters how Kirby's abilities work. The game was to be remade for the [[Game Boy Color]] as ''Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX'', but was cancelled.\n\n''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]'', released in November 1995 in North America, is a [[Breakout clone|variation]] of the game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', featuring multiple levels, some of Kirby's Copy Abilities, and various enemies in unique boss battles.\n\n''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', known as ''Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe'' in Japan and ''Kirby's Fun Pak'' in Europe, was released in North America in September 1996. ''Kirby Super Star'' is composed of eight separate games, and features several characters and abilities which have not appeared since in the series. The game features \"Helpers\", which can be created by sacrificing the ability in use, to help the player dispatch enemies.\n\nIn 1996, a ''Kirby'' mini-game series, {{nihongo foot|''Kirby's Toy Box'',|\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u7bb1|K\u0101b\u012b no Omocha Hako|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released via the [[St.GIGA]] satellite broadcasting system for the [[Satellaview]]. These mini-games were given a unique broadcast date. Mini-game titles included: ''Arrange Ball'', ''Ball Rally'', ''Baseball'', ''Cannonball'', ''Guru Guru Ball'', ''Hoshi Kuzushi'', ''Pachinko'', and ''Pinball''.<ref>Andou, N.

The game received a sequel on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1998 in Japan as ''[[Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', released in November 1997 in North America, is a direct sequel to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', as it featured the return of Kirby's animal friends. Similarly to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' features a few Copy Abilities which were modified when Kirby paired up with one of his six animal friends. The game had a multiplayer option with the second player controlling Gooey, a recurring character. The antagonist is Dark Matter, and if certain conditions are met, Zero was fought as the true final boss. The game had a unique pastel-drawing art style and used dithering to improve visual performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=Kirby's Dreamland 3 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/01/06/kirbys-dream-land-3-review|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=January 6, 2009|quote=Kirby's Dream Collection 3 (...) employed an advanced-for-the-time dithering effect to enhance the visuals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/dreamland3/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe first game to have 3D graphics in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] in North America in June 2000. The game features a compound ability system that allows two of the seven abilities in the game to be merged, making a new compound ability. It also marked the first playable instance of King Dedede, where sections of some stages had Kirby riding piggyback while King Dedede attacked enemies and obstacles with his hammer. It is considered a direct follow-up to ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' due to the reemergence of Dark Matter and the final boss, albeit in a different form, called 0<sup>2</sup> (Zero Two). It also included three four-player minigames.\n\nThe next game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' became one of Nintendo's first motion-sensor-based games in August 2000. Players are instructed to tilt the Game Boy Color to move Kirby on the screen. Quickly flicking the Game Boy Color upwards would make Kirby jump into the air. ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble'' is the only ''Kirby'' game to have a special cartridge color (transparent pink) in North America.\n\nThe only ''Kirby'' game for the [[GameCube]], ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', was released in North America in October 2003. It is a racing game which deviates greatly from usual ''Kirby'' titles, although still featuring series staples including enemies and Copy Abilities.\n\nDuring the 2003 Holiday season, a Kirby [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-reader card]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] was released. The card was released under two names, ''Kirby Slide'' and ''Kirby Puzzle''. Swiping the card would allow for a sliding puzzle game starring Kirby to be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEC30bnj0cU|title=Kirby Puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Cards were given out at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] stores and in the 2003 December issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Tips & Tricks (magazine)|Tips & Tricks]]''. The game was released to advertise the English dub of ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]''\n\n''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'' was released in October 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the second game released on that system, following ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It features Kirby in a [[Metroidvania]] format, with all the levels being interconnected and able to be completed in any order. Also unique was the in-game phone, which can be used to summon up to three additional copies of Kirby to fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe next game in the series is ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'', released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan on March 24, 2005, North America on June 13, 2005, Europe on November 25, 2005, and Australia on April 6, 2006. Unlike most previous ''Kirby'' games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a [[D-pad|directional pad]], [[analog stick]], face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, Kirby is a helpless ball, and can only move when he gains momentum, the player painting paths with the stylus to direct his movement.\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'' in late 2006, also on the Nintendo DS, which revived traditional ''Kirby'' gameplay and dabbled in the use of the touch screen to store several items and Copy Abilities in Kirby's stomach. Ability scrolls could be found that served as upgrades for each ability, giving them additional moves and/or enhanced functionality. An unlockable Copy Ability was also introduced.\n\n''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', announced for the Nintendo DS in early fall 2007<ref>{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=October 11, 2007 |title=Second Hand Hands On from Japan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/11/second-hand-hands-on-from-japan |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> and released on September 22, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/kirby-super-star-ultra/nds-14209932 |title=Kirby Super Star Ultra - Nintendo DS |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> in North America, is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star''.

The game was released in Japan on January 11, 2014, in North America on May 2, 2014, in Europe on May 16, 2014, and in Australasia on May 17, 2014. It incorporated action spanning varied depths, where Kirby could swap between the foreground and background areas. It included a multiplayer fighting mode called \"Kirby Fighters\", where players could choose one of ten available abilities and fight on themed stages, with the winner being the last Kirby standing. It also included a rhythm-based action game starring King Dedede. There were also over 250 in-game \"keychains\" to collect that featured sprites from previous Kirby games as well some original sprites based on characters from Triple Deluxe. In August 2014, Kirby Fighters Deluxe and Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe (enhanced versions of the mini-games in Kirby: Triple Deluxe) were released.\n\nAt E3 2014, a new game for the [[Wii U]] was announced. Titled ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'', the game is a direct sequel to ''Kirby: Canvas Curse'' and features a similar gameplay style. It was released by Nintendo on January 22, 2015 in Japan, February 20, 2015 in North America, May 8, 2015 in Europe and May 9, 2015 in Australasia.\n\nIn March 2016, during a Nintendo Direct, Nintendo unveiled a new game based on the context of ''Kirby: Triple Deluxe'' called ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''.

Pupupu Land}}}} a country on Planet Popstar. Popstar resembles a [[five-pointed star]] encircled by two diagonal [[Ring system|rings]].\n\nWhile most of Kirby's adventures take place on Popstar, his journeys occasionally take place on an interplanetary scale; such as in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''Milky Way Wishes'' from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n==Nature of the protagonist==\n{{main|Kirby (character)}}\nKirby is a small, pink, spherical alien with red feet, stubby flap-like arms and pink cheek-blushes. He is referred to as male in the animated series, and described as a young boy in the instruction manual for ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch his mouth to inhale foes or inflate himself with air and float. According to ''Super Smash Bros.'' instruction manual, he is 8 inches tall; this is contradicted in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', the former of which shows Kirby to be at about [[knee]] height compared to [[Samus Aran]] and the latter of which showing him to be a few inches shorter than the human girl Adeleine.\n\nKirby hails from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, where he lives in a domed house. His appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\nKirby does not commonly speak, mainly limited to grunts, shouts, and monosyllables in such games as ''Super Smash Bros'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. However he does speak in the stories written in some games' instruction manuals. He rarely speaks in-game, the only exception being ''Kirby's Avalanche''. He narrates the functions of Copy Abilities on the start menu in ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Most in-game talking Kirby does is in ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'', where Kirby explains the game's rules and gameplay. Kirby has dialogue in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'', but it is all spoken through the game's narrator.\n\n==Other media==\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nThe ''Kirby'' series was made into an [[anime]] on October 6, 2001, originally titled ''Hoshi no Kaabii''. It was produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and HAL Laboratory, Inc. It was licensed in North America by [[4Kids Entertainment]], under the title ''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!'', on [[4Kids TV]], and was distributed by [[4Kids Entertainment]] in North America and [[Nelvana Limited]] in Canada, with VHS and DVD distributions in North America by [[FUNimation Entertainment]] and DVD distributions in Australia by [[Magna Pacific]]. It ended in Japan in 2003 with 100 episodes.\n\nThe show is about the adventures Kirby has with his friends Tiff and Tuff after he crash lands in Dream Land, on Pop Star. Here, he is a legendary Star Warrior destined to save the universe from the intergalactic conqueror known as Nightmare. However, because he was awakened 200 years too early he arrived in a childlike state and his powers haven't fully developed. The ruler of Dream Land, [[King Dedede]], is jealous of the attention Kirby receives from its inhabitants and frequently orders monsters from Nightmare's company, [[Nightmare Enterprises]], in an attempt to do away with Kirby. [[Nightmare Enterprises]] at first appears to be an intergalactic delivery company, but is really a front for Nightmare's intergalactic conquest that dupes unsuspecting customers into funding Nightmare's armies. Not yet ready to achieve his destiny, Kirby must learn how to use his incredible abilities with the help of his friends, and sometimes with the help of the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], who while he claims to be loyal to King Dedede, will often work behind the scenes in order to aid Kirby or train him in the use of his abilities.\n\nThe show is based on the game series, but rather than being a direct adaptation of any of the games it uses characters and concepts from the games (especially ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'') to tell its own story.\n\n===Comics and manga===\nKirby stars in several [[manga]] series, none of which have been released outside of Japan yet. The longest running series is ''Kirby of the Stars'' (a rough English translation of ''Hoshi no Kirby''), written by Hirokazu Hikawa. This series was announced for a release in America by VIZ Media, but was never actually released.\n\nOther ''Kirby'' manga are typically one-shot comedy [[4koma]] based on the games, and have multiple artists. They have recurring themes and [[running gag]]s.\n\nKirby also appears in several German comics, featuring him as a detective and King Dedede as his friend. His animal friends appear as pets of a female Kirby look-alike with red glass slippers. In one comic, he meets Lolo, Lala, and Lulu, the protagonists of the ''[[Adventures of Lolo]]'' series. The German comics were meant to let German ''Kirby'' fans know of ''Kirby'' games which would be released there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Cancelled games===\nIn the lifetime of the ''Kirby'' series, several video games have been in development that, for various reasons, were ultimately abandoned. Such titles include ''Kirby's Air Ride 64'' (also known as ''Kirby Bowl 64'' and ''Kirby Ball 64'') on the Nintendo 64,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Kirby Ball 64 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|page=79}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Kirby Bowl 64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1996|page=23}}</ref> which was eventually released on the GameCube as ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.\n\n''Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble 2'' on the GameCube, which was supposed to use a combination of motion-sensor technology and connectivity to the Game Boy Advance via the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]].<ref>The game was presented during the Nintendo Space World 2001</ref>\n\nThere was also a planned game called ''Kid Kirby'' that was to be released on the Super Nintendo.<ref>''Other Stuff: Nintendo News''. [[DieHard GameFan]]. Volume 3. Issue 6. Number 30. Pg.129. June 1995.</ref> The game would have served as a prequel to the series and would have utilized the SNES mouse. The game was cancelled due to the declining sales of the mouse; however, early screenshots of the cancelled game have been posted online. This unreleased game was developed by [[DMA Design]] for Nintendo and was scheduled for 1995.\n\nThough resurfaced as ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', the GameCube was initially going to have its own original Kirby game, simply titled ''Kirby Adventure'' at the time. It was nearly complete and featured at E3 2005, but was cancelled due to troubles incorporating a unique multiplayer mechanic, which became the special attack in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (where all players stack on each other, hold A and release at the same time). Most of ''Kirby Adventure'' was scrapped in the game it became to be, such as the helper system that was featured in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' which made a return in the GameCube version of the game before cancellation, as well as having faster-paced gameplay similar to ''Kirby Super Star''. Such concepts would be revitalized in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Kirby'' in other video games===\n[[File:Kirby Characters in Smash.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Meta Knight]], [[King Dedede]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]  in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]\nKirby appears as a character in Nintendo's crossover [[fighting game]] series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (also developed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai), appearing in all installments of the franchise. Starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' onwards, he's joined by [[Meta Knight]] and [[King Dedede]]. Many items from the Kirby series also appear in ''Super Smash Bros'' such as the Maxim Tomato (all games), Warp Star (since ''Melee''), Dragoon (since ''Brawl'') and Star Rod (all games) as items, and Knuckle Joe (''Brawl'' and ''3DS/Wii U''), Nightmare (''3DS/Wii U'') and Chef Kawasaki (''Ultimate'') appear as characters summoned by the Assist Trophy. All playable Kirby characters in ''Smash Bros.'' have the ability to jump more than twice. Kirby has also made cameo appearances in other games as well, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and ''[[Stunt Race FX]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nThe ''Kirby'' games have received reception that ranges from mixed to very favourable reviews by players and critics.

The move has been followed by staff cuts, increased subscription prices (including 9% in Sky's family package) and the dropping of the 3D channel.\n\n===Sky Multichannels===\n{{Main|Sky Multichannels}}\n\nIn September 1993, BSkyB launched [[Sky Multichannels]] which was the present digital platform's analogue predecessor. Sky Multichannels was a subscription package that gave access not only to Sky's own channels but also those of third party broadcasters.\n\nThe service started on 1 September 1993. It was based on an idea by then CEO [[Sam Chisholm]] and chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available [[free-to-air]], broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/British-Sky-Broadcasting-Group-plc-Company-History.html|title=British Sky Broadcasting Group plc|accessdate=10 February 2007|publisher=Funding Universe}}</ref> The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001,<ref name=\"SkyAnalogueClosure\">{{cite web|url=http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/skystory.html|title=How the Sky analogue service was run down in favour of digital....|accessdate=10 February 2007|last=Wathan|first=Chris|publisher=Analoguesat|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010221157/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/skystory.html|archivedate=10 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> due to the expansion of the Sky Digital platform after its launch three years before.

The Guardian; 25 October 1993;</ref>\n\n===Launch of Sky Digital===\nBSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded [[Open....]] now called [[Sky Active]], BSkyB competed with the [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]] (later ''ITV Digital'') terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which helped bolster BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.\n\nIn addition to most channels from the Sky Multichannels package, Sky Digital launched with several new channels that were exclusive to the digital offer.\n\nThe switch-over from analogue to digital proceeded relatively quickly. In 1998, there were 6 million 'multichannel' TV homes in the UK (i.e. homes that watch television other than the traditional analogue terrestrial), and over half of these homes watched television using BSkyB's analogue service. BSkyB's digital service surpassed the analogue service in terms of subscribers in late 1999.<ref>http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/dso3.pdf</ref>\n\nBy June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave BSkyB 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected BSkyB's 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% from 1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/104016/reports/ar00.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Annual Report 2000|website=media.corporate-ir.net}}</ref>\n\nBSkyB's analogue service ended in October 2001, and the digital service would eventually be marketed as just 'Sky'.\n\nBy June 2005, the number of digital subscribers increase to 7.8m, while it produced 38,375 hours of sport in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|title=Error page|work=sky.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927223016/http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2005, in partnership with [[Vodafone]], [[Sky Mobile TV]] was launched which was the UK's first commercially available mobile TV service.

The target was first announced in August 2004, since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to Sky's direct-to-home service.

ITV Digital failed for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to numerous administrative and technical failures, nervous investors after a large down-turn in the advertising market and the [[dot com crash]], and Sky's aggressive marketing and domination of premium sporting rights.\n\nWhile Sky had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, Sky was able to join ITV Digital's [[free-to-air]] replacement, [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], in which it holds an equal stake with the [[BBC]], [[ITV plc|ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Arqiva]]. Prior to October 2005, three Sky channels were available on this platform: [[Sky News]], [[Sky3|Sky Three]], and [[Sky Sports News]]. Initially, Sky provided [[Sky Travel]] to the service. However, this was replaced by [[Sky3|Sky Three]] on 31 October 2005, which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV' in 2011.\n\nOn 8 February 2007, Sky announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels.

This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as [[Eutelsat]]'s Eurobird 1 (now [[Eutelsat 33C]]) at 28.5\u00b0E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/Eutelsat-28A.html|title=Eutelsat 28A at 28.5\u00b0E \u2013 LyngSat|work=lyngsat.com}}</ref> The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5\u00b0E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.\n\nNew Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering \u2014 However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.\n\nIt was the country's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in April 2007.<ref name=\"Freeview digital overtakes Sky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1609240/Freeview-digital-overtakes-Sky.html|title=Freeview digital overtakes Sky|work=This is Money}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the migration to Astra 2E, 2F and 2G, Sky was transmitted from the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites located at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] ([[Astra 2A|2A]]/[[Astra 2C|2C]]/[[Astra 2E|2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]) and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 33C]] satellite at 28.5\u00b0E.\n\nAs of 2019, Astra 2E, 2F and 2G are the sole satellites used by Sky UK;<ref name=\"SatExpat Sky UK satellites\">{{cite web |url=http://en.satexpat.com/tv/uk/sky/ |title=Sky UK \u2013 Frequency and channel list \u2013 Astra 2 UK Spotbeam and Astra 2 European Beam |date=2019-04-23 |accessdate=2019-04-23 }}</ref> a number of services are served via narrow UK-only [[spot beam]]s, the other services downlinked with a Europe-wide footprint.

Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services. To view the encrypted content a [[VideoGuard]] UK equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used. Unofficial [[conditional-access module|CAMs]] are now available to view the service, although use of\nthem breaks the user's contract with Sky and invalidates the user's rights to use the card.\n\n===Standard definition broadcasts===\nSky's standard definition broadcasts are in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant [[MPEG-2]], with the [[Sky Cinema]] and [[Sky Box Office]] channels including optional [[Dolby Digital]] soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using [[MPEG-4]] and most of the HD material uses the [[DVB-S2]] standard. Interactive services and 7-day [[EPG]] use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including [[modem]]s for a return path. [[Sky News]], amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-[[video on demand]] interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.\n\n===Digital satellite receivers===\nSky utilises the [[VideoGuard]] pay-TV scrambling system owned by [[NDS Group|NDS]], a [[Cisco Systems]] company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] CAMs ([[conditional-access module]]s). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the [[Personal video recorder]] (PVR) offering (branded [[Sky+]]).\n\n===Electronic programme guide===\n\n====Technology====\nSky maintains an [[electronic programme guide]] (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. TV channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit [[logical channel number]] which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed. Radio channels similarly receive a four digit EPG number (0 prefix + three digits).\n\nThe EPG differs depending on the viewer's location due to limited regional availability of certain channels or conditions relating to their [[must-carry]] status. For example, this ensures that viewers get access to the correct BBC or ITV region or that [[S4C]] gets a prominent listing in Wales.\n\nAll channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky.\n\nSky has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from [[Ofcom]]. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28\u00b0 East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee, ranging from \u00a315\u2013100,000. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.\n\nIn October 2007, Sky announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing \"very significant memory constraints\" on many of its older digiboxes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/05/bskyb.business|title=Sky to reject new channel applications|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG dubbed \"Darwin\" for their Sky+HD receivers, offering a more modern, refreshed interface and some improved functionality. Newer SkyQ UHD receivers utilise different hardware, so run a different software stack.\n\n====Numbering system====\nThe EPG numbering is altered frequently when new channels launch or receive new numbers. A few times, the EPG has been substantially altered. For example:\n*In early 2006, most channels received new numbering. This shake-up intended to split up the original ten categories in sixteen. For example, several channels that had been listed under the 'Entertainment' category where split off into a new 'Lifestyle & Culture' category while the 'News & Documentaries' category was split into two. The 'Specialist' category, which had included shopping, dating, gambling, international and adult channels was split into several genres.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/sky-in-epg-shake-up/1022082.article|title=Sky in EPG shake-up|date=31 March 2005|publisher=Broadcast}}</ref>\n*Following the integration of [[Living TV Group]] into [[BSkyB|Sky]] in early 2011, several prominent slots were freed up as many channels were closed down. It was, reported Broadband TV News, the biggest reshuffle in EPG positions for over a decade, with MTV, Comedy Central, Universal Channel, Syfy, News Corporation's FX, and 40 HD channels moving to more prominent places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |title=Why Sky EPG Changes Won't Shake Viewing Habits |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429155735/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |archivedate=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Documentaries and other channels moving towards general entertainment programming and many other channel categories being overspilled into other parts of the EPG. Sky reshuffled the channels again on 1 May 2018 which merged the documentaries and entertainment channels making many documentaries move to more prominent slots which had been occupied by time shift and standard definition channels which had been given their own areas in the 200s and 800s with the 800s being also filled with SD channels from other categories.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://storage.sky.com/prod/helpcentre/UK_TV_GUIDE_307748A02_2.pdf |title= Sky UK TV Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\nOn 12 July 2011, former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] claimed that Sky's largest shareholder \u2013 [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] \u2013 attempted to affect government policy with regards to the [[BBC]] in pursuit of its own commercial interests.<ref name=\"Brown accuses News International of using known criminals\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14120143 \"Brown accuses News International of using 'known criminals,'\"], BBC News, Tuesday 12 July 2011</ref> He went further, in a speech in Parliament on 13 July 2011, stating:\n\n<blockquote>\"Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit not standards was what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and Sky agenda under his and Mrs Brooks\u2019 leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from Sky and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom.

I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase the profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface\u2014the operating system\u2014has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110713/debtext/110713-0004.htm |title=Hansard, House of Commons Debates 13 July 2011:Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB (Column 416\u2013417) |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament.uk}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Virgin Media dispute==\n[[Virgin Media]] (re-branded in 2007 from ''NTL:Telewest'') started to offer a [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, [[BBC HD]], after the conclusion of the [[ITV HD]] trial.

Sky indicated that they will not bow down, and the channels will likely become unavailable from 1 February 2017.\n\nThe same day, Discovery sent out a press release on the dispute and also blocked access to its own website with the news. Discovery stated 'enough is enough' and claimed that Sky is paying less for its channels than it was ten years ago. In that time, Discovery had stated that its viewing share has grown by more than 20%.

Sky Multichannels was a subscription package that gave access not only to Sky's own channels but also those of third party broadcasters.\n\nThe service started on 1 September 1993. It was based on an idea by then CEO [[Sam Chisholm]] and chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept.

The Guardian; 25 October 1993;</ref>\n\n===Launch of Sky Digital===\nBSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded [[Open....]] now called [[Sky Active]], BSkyB competed with the [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]] (later ''ITV Digital'') terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which helped bolster BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.\n\nIn addition to most channels from the Sky Multichannels package, Sky Digital launched with several new channels that were exclusive to the digital offer.\n\nThe switch-over from analogue to digital proceeded relatively quickly. In 1998, there were 6 million 'multichannel' TV homes in the UK (i.e. homes that watch television other than the traditional analogue terrestrial), and over half of these homes watched television using BSkyB's analogue service. BSkyB's digital service surpassed the analogue service in terms of subscribers in late 1999.<ref>http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/dso3.pdf</ref>\n\nBy June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave BSkyB 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected BSkyB's 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% from 1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/104016/reports/ar00.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Annual Report 2000|website=media.corporate-ir.net}}</ref>\n\nBSkyB's analogue service ended in October 2001, and the digital service would eventually be marketed as just 'Sky'.\n\nBy June 2005, the number of digital subscribers increase to 7.8m, while it produced 38,375 hours of sport in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|title=Error page|work=sky.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927223016/http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2005, in partnership with [[Vodafone]], [[Sky Mobile TV]] was launched which was the UK's first commercially available mobile TV service.

Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering \u2014 However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.\n\nIt was the country's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in April 2007.<ref name=\"Freeview digital overtakes Sky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1609240/Freeview-digital-overtakes-Sky.html|title=Freeview digital overtakes Sky|work=This is Money}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the migration to Astra 2E, 2F and 2G, Sky was transmitted from the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites located at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] ([[Astra 2A|2A]]/[[Astra 2C|2C]]/[[Astra 2E|2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]) and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 33C]] satellite at 28.5\u00b0E.\n\nAs of 2019, Astra 2E, 2F and 2G are the sole satellites used by Sky UK;<ref name=\"SatExpat Sky UK satellites\">{{cite web |url=http://en.satexpat.com/tv/uk/sky/ |title=Sky UK \u2013 Frequency and channel list \u2013 Astra 2 UK Spotbeam and Astra 2 European Beam |date=2019-04-23 |accessdate=2019-04-23 }}</ref> a number of services are served via narrow UK-only [[spot beam]]s, the other services downlinked with a Europe-wide footprint.

Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services. To view the encrypted content a [[VideoGuard]] UK equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used. Unofficial [[conditional-access module|CAMs]] are now available to view the service, although use of\nthem breaks the user's contract with Sky and invalidates the user's rights to use the card.\n\n===Standard definition broadcasts===\nSky's standard definition broadcasts are in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant [[MPEG-2]], with the [[Sky Cinema]] and [[Sky Box Office]] channels including optional [[Dolby Digital]] soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using [[MPEG-4]] and most of the HD material uses the [[DVB-S2]] standard. Interactive services and 7-day [[EPG]] use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including [[modem]]s for a return path. [[Sky News]], amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-[[video on demand]] interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.\n\n===Digital satellite receivers===\nSky utilises the [[VideoGuard]] pay-TV scrambling system owned by [[NDS Group|NDS]], a [[Cisco Systems]] company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] CAMs ([[conditional-access module]]s). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the [[Personal video recorder]] (PVR) offering (branded [[Sky+]]).\n\n===Electronic programme guide===\n\n====Technology====\nSky maintains an [[electronic programme guide]] (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. TV channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit [[logical channel number]] which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed. Radio channels similarly receive a four digit EPG number (0 prefix + three digits).\n\nThe EPG differs depending on the viewer's location due to limited regional availability of certain channels or conditions relating to their [[must-carry]] status. For example, this ensures that viewers get access to the correct BBC or ITV region or that [[S4C]] gets a prominent listing in Wales.\n\nAll channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky.\n\nSky has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from [[Ofcom]]. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28\u00b0 East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee, ranging from \u00a315\u2013100,000. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.\n\nIn October 2007, Sky announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing \"very significant memory constraints\" on many of its older digiboxes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/05/bskyb.business|title=Sky to reject new channel applications|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG dubbed \"Darwin\" for their Sky+HD receivers, offering a more modern, refreshed interface and some improved functionality. Newer SkyQ UHD receivers utilise different hardware, so run a different software stack.\n\n====Numbering system====\nThe EPG numbering is altered frequently when new channels launch or receive new numbers. A few times, the EPG has been substantially altered. For example:\n*In early 2006, most channels received new numbering. This shake-up intended to split up the original ten categories in sixteen. For example, several channels that had been listed under the 'Entertainment' category where split off into a new 'Lifestyle & Culture' category while the 'News & Documentaries' category was split into two. The 'Specialist' category, which had included shopping, dating, gambling, international and adult channels was split into several genres.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/sky-in-epg-shake-up/1022082.article|title=Sky in EPG shake-up|date=31 March 2005|publisher=Broadcast}}</ref>\n*Following the integration of [[Living TV Group]] into [[BSkyB|Sky]] in early 2011, several prominent slots were freed up as many channels were closed down. It was, reported Broadband TV News, the biggest reshuffle in EPG positions for over a decade, with MTV, Comedy Central, Universal Channel, Syfy, News Corporation's FX, and 40 HD channels moving to more prominent places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |title=Why Sky EPG Changes Won't Shake Viewing Habits |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429155735/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |archivedate=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Documentaries and other channels moving towards general entertainment programming and many other channel categories being overspilled into other parts of the EPG. Sky reshuffled the channels again on 1 May 2018 which merged the documentaries and entertainment channels making many documentaries move to more prominent slots which had been occupied by time shift and standard definition channels which had been given their own areas in the 200s and 800s with the 800s being also filled with SD channels from other categories.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://storage.sky.com/prod/helpcentre/UK_TV_GUIDE_307748A02_2.pdf |title= Sky UK TV Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\nOn 12 July 2011, former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] claimed that Sky's largest shareholder \u2013 [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] \u2013 attempted to affect government policy with regards to the [[BBC]] in pursuit of its own commercial interests.<ref name=\"Brown accuses News International of using known criminals\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14120143 \"Brown accuses News International of using 'known criminals,'\"], BBC News, Tuesday 12 July 2011</ref> He went further, in a speech in Parliament on 13 July 2011, stating:\n\n<blockquote>\"Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit not standards was what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and Sky agenda under his and Mrs Brooks\u2019 leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from Sky and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom.

I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase the profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface\u2014the operating system\u2014has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110713/debtext/110713-0004.htm |title=Hansard, House of Commons Debates 13 July 2011:Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB (Column 416\u2013417) |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament.uk}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Virgin Media dispute==\n[[Virgin Media]] (re-branded in 2007 from ''NTL:Telewest'') started to offer a [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, [[BBC HD]], after the conclusion of the [[ITV HD]] trial.
