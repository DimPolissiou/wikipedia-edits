Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for [[summary judgment]] based on [[qualified immunity]] because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the circumstances confronting them.<ref>Ross, p. 246</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically. In ''[[Brosseau v. Haugen]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the use of force by a police officer who fired her gun into the back of a suspect's car after chasing the suspect on foot.<ref>Ross, p. 247\u201348</ref> The Court has also held in ''[[Scott v. Harris]]'' (2007) that a \"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\"<ref>''Scott v.

According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAdditionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at vehicles involves in high-speed car chases and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nIn a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R.

Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for [[summary judgment]] based on [[qualified immunity]] because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the circumstances confronting them.<ref>Ross, p. 246</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically. In ''[[Brosseau v. Haugen]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the use of force by a police officer who fired her gun into the back of a suspect's car after chasing the suspect on foot.<ref>Ross, p. 247\u201348</ref> The Court has also held in ''[[Scott v. Harris]]'' (2007) that a \"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\"<ref>''Scott v. Harris'', 550 U.S. 372 (2007), [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1631.pdf slip op.] at 13 (U.S. April 30, 2007).</ref> In both cases, the Court confirmed that the standard of review for force against fleeing motorists is the same \"objective reasonableness\" standard as that in ''Graham v. Connor''.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref>\n\nIf a person believes that the use of force against them is unjustified, [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] allows them to file a civil action, claiming a violation of their constitutional rights. In general, police officers are protected from individual liability from these claims by the [[qualified immunity]] doctrine, which prevents government officials, including police officers, from being held individually liable for federal civil rights violations unless their conduct violated clearly established law at the time in question.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref> In ''[[Johnson v.

Jones'' prevents Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in ''Johnson'', the summary judgment order was not appealable because \"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', ''i.e.'' which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6.</ref> In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMoving onto the legal questions, Alito first explained why he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers' violated \"clearly established law\" by first answering whether the officers' actually violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, citing the Court's decision in ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reach a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L. Ross of [[Valdosta State University]] discussed the legal and practical implications of ''Plumhoff''. According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at vehicles involves in high-speed car chases and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at [[Emory University School of Law]], argued that the Court's decision in ''Plumhoff'' was inconsistent with the precedent it set in ''Scott'', commenting that the Court \"jettisoned ''Scott''<nowiki/>'s careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|title=High-speed police pursuits and deadly force|last=Nash|first=Jonathan R.|date=August 19, 2014|website=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414175726/https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|archive-date=April 14, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Nash stated there were differences between the facts in ''Plumhoff'' versus the facts in ''Scott'', which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion. For example, in ''Scott'', the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', the police used their firearms. Additionally, in ''Scott'', the driver was the only one in the fleeing car, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', Rickard had a passenger.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n; Sources\n* ''Plumhoff v.

It was also called '''Lunik 11'''. Luna 11 was launched towards the [[Moon]] from an Earth-orbiting platform and entered lunar orbit on 27 August 1966.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe objectives of the mission included the study of:\n* lunar gamma and X-ray emissions in order to determine the Moon's chemical composition;\n* lunar gravitational anomalies;\n* the concentration of meteorite streams near the Moon;\n* the intensity of hard [[corpuscular radiation]] near the Moon.\n\n137 radio transmissions and 277 orbits of the Moon were completed before the batteries failed on 1 October 1966.\n\nThis subset of the \"second-generation\" Luna spacecraft, the E-6LF, was designed to take the first photographs of the surface of the Moon from lunar orbit. A secondary objective was to obtain data on mass concentrations (\"mascons\") on the Moon first detected by [[Luna 10]]. Using the Ye-6 bus, a suite of scientific instruments (plus an imaging system similar to the one used on [[Zond 3]]) replaced the small lander capsule used on the soft-landing flights. The resolution of the photos was 15 to 20 meters. A technological experiment included testing the efficiency of gear transmission in a vacuum as a test for a future lunar rover.\n\nLuna 11, launched only two weeks after the U.S. [[Lunar Orbiter]], entered lunar orbit at 21:49 GMT on 27 August 1966. Parameters were 160 x 1193 kilometers. During the mission, the TV camera failed to return usable images because the spacecraft lost proper orientation to face the lunar surface when a foreign object was lodged in the nozzle of one of the attitude-control thrusters. The other instruments functioned without fault before the mission formally ended on 1 October 1966 after the power supply had been depleted.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna.php Zarya - Luna programme chronology]\n\n{{Luna programme}}\n{{Moon spacecraft|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Orbital launches in 1966}}\n\n[[Category:Luna program]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 1966]]\n[[Category:1966 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by Molniya-M rockets]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft that orbited the Moon]]\n[[Category:Non Earth orbiting satellites of the Soviet Union]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox spaceflight\n| name                  = Luna 11\n| image                 = \n| image_caption         = \n\n| mission_type          = Lunar orbiter\n| operator              = [[NPO Lavochkin|GSMZ Lavochkin]]\n| COSPAR_ID             = 1966-078A\n| SATCAT                = 02406\n| mission_duration      = 38 days\n\n| spacecraft_type       = [[E-6LF]]\n| manufacturer          = [[NPO Lavochkin|GSMZ Lavochkin]]\n| dry_mass              = 1136 kg\n| launch_mass           = 1640 kg\n| power                 = \n| instruments           = Imaging system for lunar photography<br/>[[Gamma-ray spectrometer]]<br/>[[Magnetometer]]<br/>Radiation detectors<br/>Infrared radiometer<br/>Meteoroid detector<br/>R-1 transmission experiment\n\n| launch_date           = 24 August 1966, 08:09:00 GMT \n| launch_rocket         = [[Molniya-M]] 8K78M  \n| launch_site           = [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]], [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 31|Site 31/6]]\n| launch_contractor     = [[TsSKB-Progress]]\n\n| last_contact          = 1 October 1966\n| decay_date            = Late 1966 or Early 1967\n\n| orbit_epoch           = 24 August 1966, 20:00:00 GMT <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-078A|title=NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Trajectory Details|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref>\n| orbit_reference       = [[selenocentric orbit|Selenocentric]]\n| orbit_periapsis       = 1898 km\n| orbit_apoapsis        = 2931 km \n| orbit_inclination     = 27\u00b0\n| orbit_period          = 178 minutes\n| apsis                 = selene\n\n|interplanetary         =  \n {{Infobox spaceflight/IP\n   |type                = orbiter\n   |object              = [[Moon|Lunar]]\n   |orbits              = 277\n   |arrival_date        = 27 August 1966, 21:49 GMT\n   |location            = <!--impact site-->\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Luna 11''' (E-6LF series) was an [[uncrewed space mission]] of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna program]].
