The Commonwealth and MBTA began to purchase several lines, like the [[Lowell Line]] between Somerville and Wilmington, from the B&M.\n\nIn 1969 the B&M transported 24,000 passengers every weekday on four separate routes. Its yearly deficit was {{USD|3.2 million}}. A pool of 86 [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s provided the service.<ref>{{Dorin-Commuter|p=13}}</ref> B&M filed for bankruptcy protection in 1970.

On July 28, 1965, the MBTA signed an agreement with the New Haven Railroad to purchase {{convert|11|miles}} of the former Old Colony mainline from [[Fort Point Channel]] to South Braintree in order to construct a new rapid transit line along the corridor. The line was expected to be completed within two years.

As part of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] Boston Extension's construction in the 1960s, the Worcester Line's roadbed between Route 128 and Boston was sold to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike Authority]], with the provison that the control of the railroad remain with NYC. Conrail inherited the line which formed a vital freight artery between Boston's Beacon Yard and Conrail's [[Selkirk Yard]]. The Riverside-Framingham section was sold to the MBTA in 1976 as part of their larger acquisition of PC commuter assets, but the section past Framingham remained in Conrail control.<ref name=netransit /> In September 2009, Conrail successor [[CSX Transportation]] and the Commonwealth finalized a $100 million agreement to purchase CSX's Framingham to Worcester tracks, as well as the [[Grand Junction Railroad]] plus lines which will be part of the [[South Coast Rail]] project, to improve service on the Framingham/Worcester Line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transportation.blog.state.ma.us/blog/2009/09/lt-governor-historic-csx-rail-agreement.html |title=Lt.

After bankruptcy, B&M continued to operate trains under the protection of the federal bankruptcy court, in the hopes that a reorganization could make it profitable again. It emerged from the court's protection when [[Timothy Mellon]]'s [[Pan Am Railways|Guilford Transportation Industries]] (GTI) bought it in 1983.<ref name=netransit /> GTI let the contract expire in 1987, after a bitter strike had shut down most of the northside lines in 1986.<ref name=netransit />\n\nFrom 1987 to 2003, [[Amtrak]] managed all of Boston's commuter rail.<ref name=netransit /> The relationship between MBTA and Amtrak was often rocky, and Amtrak did not submit a bid when the contract expired in 2003. MBTA observers saw Amtrak as having been a reliable manager and operator, but Amtrak sometimes experienced strained relations with the MBTA. Quibbles centered on equipment failures, crewing issues about the number of conductors per train, and responsibility for late trains. Because of these issues, and Amtrak's repeated statements that the MBTA contract was unreasonable, few were surprised at Amtrak's decision not to bid again.<ref name=\"MBCR contract\">{{cite web\n| title =MBTA Exercises Option With MBCR For Commuter Rail Service, Launches New Customer-Focused Improvements| publisher = MBTA| date = January 6, 2010| url = http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=18672&month=&year=| quote =MBTA extends MBCR contract another two years.}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|MBCR}}\nTwo tenders were submitted, one from GTI and another from the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company (MBCR), a partnership between [[Veolia Transport|Connex]] (later Veolia), [[Bombardier Transportation]] and Alternate Concepts, Inc., the latter of which won the tender.

However, the Commonwealth's support for rail operations began in the 1950s with contracted operations and subsidies to railroads providing commuter service, and more so in 1964 with the advent of MBTA.\n*The Commonwealth of Massachusetts pioneered the concept of \"Park and Ride\" by providing funds to construct the [[Route 128 Station]] on NH's Providence Line, at a location where the radial line intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 128]], the [[beltway]] encircling greater Boston. Route 128 Station was established 1953 by NH President [[Frederic C. Dumaine, Jr.]].

However, MBTA does not operate electric equipment on the Providence Line, as such equipment would be unusable on other lines.\n*As [[Big Dig]] environmental mitigation, MBTA invested heavily in the Commuter Rail system by restoring large sections of the Old Colony division, which was abandoned in 1959. Service along the two main [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Old Colony Lines]] was reestablished in 1997, and the [[Greenbush Line]] opened in 2007.<ref name=netransit />\n*After 1975, [[Framingham/Worcester Line]] service was cut back to [[Framingham (MBTA station)|Framingham]], though other lines reached exurbs more distant from Boston than Framingham.

As part of this project, MBTA allowed [[Centralized Traffic Control]] to be installed on this branch, greatly increasing its signal capacity.<ref name=netransit /> Regular service was kept on the [[Fairmount Line]] after 1987 because the relocated service was popular with residents of Dorchester and Roxbury.

(The \"ADA\" coaches support compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].)\n\nTrainlined doors that open automatically via central control are available on some equipment, but at low level platforms the conductor in each car must manually open a trap to allow passengers to descend via stairs onto the platform.\n\n[[Positive Train Control]] is scheduled to be implemented on the entire system per a federal mandate, which requires installation by the end of 2018 with the possibility of a two-year extension. {{As of|November 2015}}, the MBTA expects to complete PTC on the southside lines by December 2018, on the northside lines by March 2020, and an overlay for freight on the sections of [[Pan Am Railways]]' Freight Main Line which overlap MBTA territory by August 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Board_Meetings/FMCBPTCAward110215.pdf |title=Commuter Rail Positive Train Control (PTC) Project: Financial Management Control Board Presentation |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=November 2, 2015 |first=Gerard J. |last=Polcari |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Future operations===\nIn November 2019, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board voted to back plans to further electrify the Commuter Rail system and increase service along key corridors.

Both of those lines, as well as the Providence/Stoughton line, are also to be electrified under the plan. The projected cost of such plans were not immediately clear at the time of the board's vote, but projections range from $10.6 billion to $28.9 billion, depending upon the results of the pilot program and future possible expansion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2019/11/04/mbta-regional-rail-electric-trains |title=MBTA Board Commits To Reimagined Commuter Rail System |publisher=WBUR |date=November 4, 2019 |first=Chris |last=Lisinski |accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Planned expansions==\n<!-- EDITORIAL NOTE: When major updates are made to this section, be sure to also update the brief summary section in the main [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] article, which points to here. -->\n\n===South Station lines===\n{{Outdated|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Foxboro MBTA station, Foxborough MA.jpg|thumb|right|Foxboro station is proposed as the terminus of a Franklin Line branch]]\nThe [[South Coast Rail]] project is proposed to extend commuter rail service to the South Coast cities of [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], and [[New Bedford]].

MBTA observers saw Amtrak as having been a reliable manager and operator, but Amtrak sometimes experienced strained relations with the MBTA. Quibbles centered on equipment failures, crewing issues about the number of conductors per train, and responsibility for late trains. Because of these issues, and Amtrak's repeated statements that the MBTA contract was unreasonable, few were surprised at Amtrak's decision not to bid again.<ref name=\"MBCR contract\">{{cite web\n| title =MBTA Exercises Option With MBCR For Commuter Rail Service, Launches New Customer-Focused Improvements| publisher = MBTA| date = January 6, 2010| url = http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=18672&month=&year=| quote =MBTA extends MBCR contract another two years.}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|MBCR}}\nTwo tenders were submitted, one from GTI and another from the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company (MBCR), a partnership between [[Veolia Transport|Connex]] (later Veolia), [[Bombardier Transportation]] and Alternate Concepts, Inc., the latter of which won the tender.

However, the Commonwealth's support for rail operations began in the 1950s with contracted operations and subsidies to railroads providing commuter service, and more so in 1964 with the advent of MBTA.\n*The Commonwealth of Massachusetts pioneered the concept of \"Park and Ride\" by providing funds to construct the [[Route 128 Station]] on NH's Providence Line, at a location where the radial line intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 128]], the [[beltway]] encircling greater Boston. Route 128 Station was established 1953 by NH President [[Frederic C. Dumaine, Jr.]].

However, MBTA does not operate electric equipment on the Providence Line, as such equipment would be unusable on other lines.\n*As [[Big Dig]] environmental mitigation, MBTA invested heavily in the Commuter Rail system by restoring large sections of the Old Colony division, which was abandoned in 1959. Service along the two main [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Old Colony Lines]] was reestablished in 1997, and the [[Greenbush Line]] opened in 2007.<ref name=netransit />\n*After 1975, [[Framingham/Worcester Line]] service was cut back to [[Framingham (MBTA station)|Framingham]], though other lines reached exurbs more distant from Boston than Framingham.

This was accomplished by a series of rationalizations, such as closing lightly used lines, concentrating service on heavily utilized lines, and re-opening formerly abandoned branches with high traffic potential, such as the Old Colony Lines. A general growth of transit usage in the [[Northeastern United States]] also contributed. Growing ridership in this way required substantial capital investment, which was provided by a mixture of Federal mass transit funds and Commonwealth transportation bond issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Train operations==\n[[File:Inbound Campello.JPG|thumb|An MBTA train at [[Campello (MBTA station)|Campello]] station inbound to South Station.]]\nLike most commuter railroads in the Northeastern United States, MBTA is a member of the [[Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee]] (NORAC) and uses the rulebook promulgated by that organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58167/585157.pdf |title=NORAC Operating Rules |publisher=Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee |date=November 6, 2011 |edition=10 |via=National Transportation Safety Board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203171210/http://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58167/585157.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> Much of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is governed by NORAC rule 251, as the tracks are signalled for movement in one direction of travel only.
