This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

Herbert Engineering and ABS provides the technical support for CargoMax.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Direct Damage Stability Module===\nThe CargoMax Direct Damage Stability (DDS) module allows tanker operators to load nonstandard cargos or non-standard configurations while ensuring that loading operations comply with requirements for [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|damage stability]], [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|intact stability]], and [[Strength of ships|longitudinal strength]]. The DDS module allows the user to investigate the compliance of any given loading procedure and can be used to demonstrate compliance during [[flag state]], [[Port State|port state]], [[Classification society|classification]], or independent chartering inspections.\n\n===Grain Stability Features for Bulk Carriers===\nCargoMax implements recent supplemental requirements for vessels carrying [[Bulk cargo|bulk]] or grain cargo: a secondary strength evaluation and a damage stability evaluation. It provides a compliance report that includes the requirements for each [[Hold (ship)|cargo hold]] or set of holds, the actual loading for all holds, and a pass/fail status. To assess potential damages, the cargo in each hold is assigned a [[Permeability (nautical)|permeability]], and the program simulates damage in each hold; the equilibrium waterline is calculated, and the amount of water flooding the hold is determined. The strength results for each damaged hold are compared with the requirement\u2019s allowed strength, and an overall status is displayed. The program also allows the user to individually investigate the damage conditions for any hold.\nCargoMax has additional features to simplify the production of Grain Stability Reports for port authorities and [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] managers. Based on information entered by the user, the program can provide reports according to several loading-report standards: the U.S. [[National Cargo Bureau]], [[Transport Canada|Trans-port Canada]], and the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]].\n\n[[Image:GaugingCargoMax.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Gauging System Interface]]\n\n===Load / Discharge Sequencer Module===\nEach step in the load/discharge or ballast water exchange sequence can be evaluated to ensure that all relevant strength, stability, [[Draft (hull)|draft]], or other criteria are met.\n\n===Interface with Tank Gauging System===\nCargoMax can be provided with a direct interface to various tank and draft gauge systems such as Ian-Conrad Bergan, SAAB, Autronica, Skarpenord and others.

In 1923 he was baptized and confirmed in the [[Catholic Church]], adopting the surname ''Laxness'' (after the homestead on which he was raised) and adding the name ''Kiljan'' (the Icelandic name of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[martyr]] [[Saint Killian]]). While staying at the abbey Laxness practiced self-study, read books, and studied [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]]. He became a member of a group which prayed for reversion of the [[Nordic countries]] back to Catholicism. Laxness wrote of his experiences in the books ''Undir Helgahn\u00fak'' (1924) and, more importantly, in ''[[Vefarinn mikli fr\u00e1 Kasm\u00edr]]'' (''The Great Weaver from Kashmir''). That novel, published in 1927, was hailed by noted Icelandic critic Kristj\u00e1n Albertsson: \n<blockquote>\"Finally, finally, a grand novel which towers like a cliff above the flatland of contemporary Icelandic poetry and fiction! Iceland has gained a new literary giant - it is our duty to celebrate the fact with joy!\"<ref>Albertsson, Kr\u00edstian, ''Vaka'' 1.3, 1927</ref></blockquote> Laxness's religious period did not last long.\nLaxness lived in the [[United States]] from 1927 to 1929, giving lectures on Iceland and attempting to write screenplays for [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]].<ref>Einarsson, Stef\u00e1n, ''A History of Icelandic Literature'', New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, p. 317 OCLC 264046441</ref> He became \"enamored\" of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[City Lights]]''.<ref>Gu\u00f0mundsson, p. 173</ref> During this stay he became attracted to [[socialism]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1955/laxness.html Halld\u00f3r Laxness biography]. nobelprize.org</ref> Laxness said that he \"did not become a socialist in America from studying manuals of socialism but from watching the starving unemployed in the parks.\"<ref>Laxness, Halld\u00f3r,''Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ub\u00f3kin'', \u00deri\u00f0ja \u00fatg\u00e1fa (3rd edition), (Reykjav\u00edk, 1949), p.9</ref> \"\u2026 Laxness joined the socialist [[bandwagon effect|bandwagon]]\u2026 with a book ''Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ub\u00f3kin'' (''The Book of the People'', 1929) of brilliant [[burlesque]] and satirical essays\u2026 \"<ref>Einarsson, p. 292 {{OCLC|264046441}}</ref> \"Beside the fundamental idea of socialism, the strong sense of Icelandic individuality is also the sustaining element in ''Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ub\u00f3kin''.

This resulted in charges being filed against him, his detention and the forfeiture of his passport. With the aid of [[Upton Sinclair]] and the [[ACLU]], the charges were dropped. Laxness returned to Iceland later that year.<ref>Gu\u00f0mundsson, pp. 150-151</ref>\n\n==1930s==\nBy the 1930s Laxness \"had become the apostle of the younger generation\" and was \"viciously\" attacking the Christian spiritualism of [[Einar Hj\u00f6rleifsson Kvaran]], an influential writer who had been considered for the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>Einarsson, pp. 263\u20134</ref>\n<blockquote>\"\u2026 with ''Salka Valka'' (1931\u201332) began the great series of sociological novels, often coloured with socialist ideas, continuing almost without a break for nearly twenty years.

Halld\u00f3r started to read books and write stories at an early age. He attended the technical school in Reykjav\u00edk from 1915 to 1916 and had an article published in the newspaper ''[[Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0]]'' in 1916.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Halld\u00f3r Laxness (23 April 1902-8 February 1998)|last = Kress|first = Helga|date = 2004|journal = Dictionary of Literary Biography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Tartt|first2 = Alison|editor-last = Stevens|editor-first = Patrick J.}}</ref> By the time his first novel was published (''Barn n\u00e1tt\u00farunnar'', 1919), Halld\u00f3r had already begun his travels on the European continent.<ref>Gu\u00f0mundsson, pp. 33-34</ref>\n\n==1920s==\nIn 1922, Halld\u00f3r joined the [[abbey|Abbaye]] S''aint-''Maurice''-''et''-''S''aint-''Maur in [[Clervaux]], [[Luxembourg]] where the [[Benedictine Order|monks]] followed the rules of [[Saint Benedict of Nursia]]. In 1923 he was baptized and confirmed in the [[Catholic Church]], adopting the surname ''Laxness'' (after the homestead on which he was raised) and adding the name ''Kiljan'' (the Icelandic name of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[martyr]] [[Saint Killian]]). While staying at the abbey Laxness practiced self-study, read books, and studied [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]]. He became a member of a group which prayed for reversion of the [[Nordic countries]] back to Catholicism. Laxness wrote of his experiences in the books ''Undir Helgahn\u00fak'' (1924) and, more importantly, in ''[[Vefarinn mikli fr\u00e1 Kasm\u00edr]]'' (''The Great Weaver from Kashmir''). That novel, published in 1927, was hailed by noted Icelandic critic Kristj\u00e1n Albertsson: \n<blockquote>\"Finally, finally, a grand novel which towers like a cliff above the flatland of contemporary Icelandic poetry and fiction! Iceland has gained a new literary giant - it is our duty to celebrate the fact with joy!\"<ref>Albertsson, Kr\u00edstian, ''Vaka'' 1.3, 1927</ref></blockquote> Laxness's religious period did not last long.\nLaxness lived in the [[United States]] from 1927 to 1929, giving lectures on Iceland and attempting to write screenplays for [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]].<ref>Einarsson, Stef\u00e1n, ''A History of Icelandic Literature'', New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, p. 317 OCLC 264046441</ref> He became \"enamored\" of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[City Lights]]''.<ref>Gu\u00f0mundsson, p. 173</ref> During this stay he became attracted to [[socialism]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1955/laxness.html Halld\u00f3r Laxness biography]. nobelprize.org</ref> Laxness said that he \"did not become a socialist in America from studying manuals of socialism but from watching the starving unemployed in the parks.\"<ref>Laxness, Halld\u00f3r,''Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ub\u00f3kin'', \u00deri\u00f0ja \u00fatg\u00e1fa (3rd edition), (Reykjav\u00edk, 1949), p.9</ref> \"\u2026 Laxness joined the socialist [[bandwagon effect|bandwagon]]\u2026 with a book ''Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ub\u00f3kin'' (''The Book of the People'', 1929) of brilliant [[burlesque]] and satirical essays\u2026 \"<ref>Einarsson, p. 292 {{OCLC|264046441}}</ref> \"Beside the fundamental idea of socialism, the strong sense of Icelandic individuality is also the sustaining element in ''Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ub\u00f3kin''.

The airport has some passenger service operated by [[Kenmore Air]] and [[JSX (airline)|JSX]], but is mostly used by [[general aviation]] and [[Cargo airline|cargo]]. It is named for the founder of [[Boeing]], [[William E. Boeing]] and was constructed in 1928, serving as the city's primary airport until the opening of [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]] in 1944. The airport's property is mostly in Seattle just south of [[Georgetown, Seattle|Georgetown]], with its southern tip extending into [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]]. The Airport covers {{convert|634|acre|ha}}, averages more than 180,000 operations annually, and has approximately 380 based aircraft.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\n==History==\n\nBoeing Field was Seattle's main passenger airport from its construction in 1928 until [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]] began operations in the late 1940s, with the exception of its use for military purposes during [[World War II]]. The Boeing Company continues to use the field for testing and delivery of its [[airplanes]], and it is still a major regional cargo [[Airline hub|hub]]. It is also used by [[Air Force One]] when the [[President of the United States]] visits the Seattle area.\n\nThe August 1946 [[OAG (Air Travel Intelligence)|OAG]] lists 24 [[United Airlines]] weekday departures, 10 weekly flights on [[Northwest Airlines]] and several [[Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-3]]s a week to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] via [[Annette Island Airport]], which then served [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]].\n\nBoeing Field has two air carriers, [[JSX (airline)|JSX]], that offers daily passenger jet service to [[Oakland International Airport]], and Kenmore Air that offers 4-6 daily services to each Friday Harbor and East Sound/Orcas Island. Before 2019, the last scheduled passenger jet service was on [[Hughes Airwest]] in 1971 and before that by predecessors Air West and [[West Coast Airlines]], all using [[DC-9]]s. A proposal by [[Southwest Airlines]] in June 2005 was submitted to King County to relocate from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Boeing Field, but was rejected by [[County Executive|King County Executive]] [[Ron Sims]] in October. A similar proposal by [[Alaska Airlines]] (which was a response to the Southwest proposal) was also rejected. Southwest Airlines said it wanted to avoid the heavy fees at Sea-Tac due to its expansion program.\n\nThe transfer of ownership of Boeing Field from King County to the [[Port of Seattle]] was proposed in 2007 as part of a land swap with land owned by the Port.<ref>[http://www.portseattle.org/news/press/2007/02_26_2007_20.shtml County, Port, BNSF Announce Signed Memoranda on Land Deal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725055956/http://www.portseattle.org/news/press/2007/02_26_2007_20.shtml |date=2008-07-25 }}, Port of Seattle, February 26, 2007.
