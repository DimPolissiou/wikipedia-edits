In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\n\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \"Green Schools\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.\n\nThe idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Earth Summit]]\n** [[Agenda 21]]\n** [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]\n* [[Durban III]] The conference opened on 22 September 2011\n* [[Planetary boundaries#United Nations endorsement|Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n* [[The United Nations Ocean Conference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110420002837/http://www.uncsd2012.org/ United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]\n* [[Brundtland Report|Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development]]\n** [http://rio20.ebc.com.br/memoria/ Videos, photos and information about the Summit in Brazil]\n** [http://rio20.net/en/ Rio+20 Portal.

There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted.

In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\n\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \"Green Schools\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.\n\nThe idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Earth Summit]]\n** [[Agenda 21]]\n** [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]\n* [[Durban III]] The conference opened on 22 September 2011\n* [[Planetary boundaries#United Nations endorsement|Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n* [[The United Nations Ocean Conference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110420002837/http://www.uncsd2012.org/ United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]\n* [[Brundtland Report|Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development]]\n** [http://rio20.ebc.com.br/memoria/ Videos, photos and information about the Summit in Brazil]\n** [http://rio20.net/en/ Rio+20 Portal.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the he [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Business leaders in the colony were disgruntled as well, and boosted production of goods not mentioned in the agreement to sell to the neutral United States at their standard market value.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=235}} In 1942, after the United States joined the Allies, the Belgian government negotiated a new economic agreement with the United States and United Kingdom.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the he [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Grace gets a calling about a bridge over the Harlem River. She and Ben go there and find Adrian, who had the same calling. Grace\u2019s water breaks and Ben rushes her to the hospital. Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes). It turns out the specialist surgeon who can save both Grace and the baby is the man rescued by Adrian. Despite this, Adrian tells Ben he still does not believe the callings are ultimately good. Jared is called to the bar where Billy and other Xers are holding Zeke captive. Simon arrives with Erika and orders Zeke to be killed, which is heard by Michaela and others through the bug. This leads to Simon, Erika, Billy, and two other Xers being arrested during the police raid. Tamara accuses Jared of only getting close to her to capture the Xers which Jared denies.

Michaela works with Jared to follow Oscar's steps, resulting in a bust at a meth lab run by ex-con Jace Baylor. Jace and his brother Pete were in cahoots with the bus driver Kory, who drove the bus that Oscar got on. At the lab, Michaela gets another calling to \"let him go\", but has to ignore it when Jace reaches for a weapon.

She further praised the series for maintaining the standard of quality it set with its premiere episode saying, \"Heavily serialized shows, such as ''Lost'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', or ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' often start with a great concept and first episode.

When they land they are diverted to [[Stewart International Airport]] in Newburgh, NY.  The passengers and crew learn that the current date is November 4, 2018.  Over five-and-a-half years have passed while they were in the air. Police officer Michaela learns that her mother has died, and her fianc\u00e9, Jared, has married her best friend. Michaela begins hearing a voice that guides her to save a child from being hit by a bus and to rescue two abducted young girls. Medical researcher Saanvi learns that her work has helped save hundreds of pediatric cancer patients while she was gone.

Michaela and Zeke get married where Zeke's parents are in the same area. Jace, Pete, and Kory engineer an escape from the bus that is taking them to [[Rikers Island|Rikers]].

A pedestrian notifies a patrol officer of the bag Michaela left behind, botching the trade as Jace flees with Cal. Zeke has a calling which helps them locate Cal in the [[Catskill Mountains]]. At a remote cabin, Pete frees Cal. Michaela, Ben and Zeke approach the cabin as Cal leads the three criminals onto a frozen lake. All fall through the ice, but Zeke jumps in, saves Cal, then dies. Within minutes, Zeke comes back to life, appearing free from hypothermia and the death date. Ben concludes that the only way to beat the death date is to follow the callings. Elsewhere, Saanvi ignores Vance's requests and tracks down The Major, poisoning her in hopes of gathering information. As the two struggle, a vial of antidote breaks and The Major dies. Ben has another calling in which Flight 828 explodes and crashes into the ocean. To Jared's disbelief, divers are unable to locate the bodies of the three criminals in the frozen lake. A Cuban fishing boat recovers the tail of Flight 828 while fishing in the ocean, as a dumbfounded fisherman claims it's from the plane that returned.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn August 23, 2017, [[NBC]] gave the production a [[put pilot]] commitment.

Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1 million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers.

The roof was dynamited at war's end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper.

The amount of ash produced in the [[cremation]] of a person is about a shoebox full, if done in a proper crematorium. However, eyewitness testimonies documented by Hilberg's ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' describe the burning process used in [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] to have carried out in multiple open-air grills where stacks of bodies were burned on top of metal bars. These grills were operated by burning piles of wood underneath.\n\nCremation in the open at the [[Operation Reinhard|Reinhard]] death camps (Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec) was discussed at [[Nuremberg]] on the 7th April 1946 by [[Georg Konrad Morgen]], [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS judge]] and lawyer who investigated crimes committed in Nazi concentration camps. He stated: \"The whole thing was like an assembly line. At the last stop they reached a big room, and were told that this was the bath.

Complicating the matter is that various instances have been reported where the death tolls of particular death camps were claimed to be overstated. These claims vary in verifiability and objectivity. A much-quoted instance of disputing the toll is the \"Breitbard Document\" (actually a paper by Aaron Breitbart),<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Aaron Breitbart]]|title=Responses to Revisionist Arguments|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|website=motlc.wiesenthal.com|publisher=[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]|accessdate=10 January 2017|location=[[Los Angeles]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403232419/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  which describes a commemorative plaque at Auschwitz to the victims that died there, which reads: \"Four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.\" In 1990, a new plaque replaced the old one. It now says, \"May this place where the Nazis assassinated 1,500,000 men, women and children, a majority of them Jews from diverse European countries, be forever for mankind a cry of despair and of warning.\" The lower numbers are due to the fact that the Soviets \"purposely overstated the number of non-Jewish casualties at Auschwitz-Birkenau,\" according to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. Holocaust deniers insist that the number of Jews killed therefore be lowered by at least 2.5 million. However, the plaque had never been used as an accurate historical source by mainstream historians.<ref>Hilberg, R. Op. Cit.</ref><ref>Dawidowicz, L., The War Against the Jews.

Glynn#\"The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!\"|The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!]]\", suggests the reported death toll is inaccurate and was invented to fit propaganda.<ref>[[Robert N.

Proctor]] has criticized such claims stating \"[this] oddity has been exploited by Holocaust deniers but is simply a remarkable coincidence and nothing more\".\n\n===International Committee of the Red Cross===\nHolocaust deniers misrepresent and omit information contained in [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] reports that contradict their claims.<ref name=Lipstadt114>Lipstadt, p. 114.</ref> Critics argue that [[Richard Verrall]] in his \"[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]\" pamphlet (published under the pseudonym Richard E.

He used their responses to argue that showers functioned as showers and were not part of a killing installation. However this is considered misrepresentation by critics, as the passage Harwood cited is in reference to Allied camps for civilians in Egypt and thus had nothing to do with Nazi concentration camps.<ref name=Lipstadt115>Lipstadt, p. 115.</ref>\n[[Image:ICRC letter - traceable deaths only.jpg|thumb|left|A letter from the Sonderstandesamt (special registry office)\n at [[Bad Arolsen]] regarding only deaths at Nazi concentration camps that were registered by this institution (not to be confused with the numbers of deaths officially registered in the camps themselves).

Note that the English translations are not a part of the original document and are incorrect: the document does not come from the Red Cross. \"Anzahl\" means \"count\", \"number\" and not \"Total Deaths\".]]\n\nHarwood also claimed that ''[[:de:Die Tat (Schweizer Zeitung)|Die Tat]]'', a Swiss tabloid newspaper, published statistics that concluded the number of people who died in Nazi prisons and camps from 1939 to 1945 based on ICRC statistics was \"300,000, not all of whom were Jews\".<ref name=Lipstadt116>Lipstadt, p. 116.</ref> The January 19, 1955 edition of Die Tat did indeed give a 300,000 figure, but this was only in reference to \"Germans and German Jews\" and not nationals of other countries.<ref name=Lipstadt117>Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref> In the 1978 official bulletin, entitled \"False Propaganda\", the ICRC denounced Holocaust denial and confirmed that the agency \"Never published\u2014or even compiled\u2014statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it\" and stated that its mission was \"to help war victims, not to count them\",<ref name=Bulletin25>ICRC ''Bulletin No. 25, Feb. 1, 1978'', cited in Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Robert|title=Holocaust Denial and the Law: A Comparative Study|date=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=9781403980502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svfFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\">{{cite journal|title=Red cross exposure of \"false propaganda\"|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|date=January 1978|volume=12|issue=2|page=11|doi=10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431|issn=0031-322X}}</ref> and questioned how they would have even been able to obtain such statistics had they wanted to, given that they were \"only able to enter only a few concentration camps...in the final days of the war\".<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The agency states that the figures used are \"the number of deaths recorded by the [[International Tracing Service]] on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and accordingly bear no relation to the total death tolls, since the Nazis destroyed much documentation, and that many deaths occurred in camps where prisoners were generally not registered.<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The ICRC considers this misrepresentation as \"propaganda\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and because these claims regarding the ICRC were used for the defense of [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] at his trial in 1985, critics state that despite the agency's attempts to demonstrate the truth, Holocaust deniers have continued to rely on ICRC based disinformation.<ref name=Lipstadt117/> Archives of the International Tracing Service (located in [[Bad Arolsen]]) responding to such misrepresentation can be found here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/index.html |title=Archives |publisher=Its-Arolsen.Org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\nIn 1979, the ICRC stated a second time that they have \"never tried to compile statistics on the victims of the war\",<ref name=icrc300000>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/international/red-cross/ftp.py?orgs/international/red-cross//300000-victims.response |title=Comite International De La Croix-Rouge |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> nor \"certified the accuracy of the statistics produced by a third party\",<ref name=icrc300000/> and state that the authors of such material have \"falsified\" both claims that the document originates from the ICRC and refers exclusively to Jews.<ref name=icrc300000/>\n\nAs well as in personal correspondence, the ICRC has also addressed this misrepresentation by several other means. In 1975, the ICRC wrote to the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] in [[London]] regarding Harwood's citations, stating:\n{{quote|The figures cited by the author of the booklet are based upon statistics falsely attributed to us, evidently for the purpose of giving them credibility, despite the fact that we never publish information of this kind.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suzman|first1=Arthur|last2=Diamond|first2=Denis|title=Six million did die: the truth shall prevail Arthur Suzman and Denis Diamond|date=1978|publisher=South African Jewish Board of Deputies|isbn=978-0620031288|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GEJAQAAIAAJ&q=The+figures+cited+by+the+author+of+the+booklet+are+based+upon+statistics+falsely+attributed+to+us,+evidently+for+the+purpose+of+giving+them+credibility,+despite+the+fact+that+we+never+publish+information+of+this+kind}}</ref>|Fran\u00e7oise Perret|''Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge, to Jacob Gewirtz, August 22, 1975.''}}\n\n====Baseler Nachrichten====\nSimilarly, Harwood wrote that the June 4, 1946 edition of ''Baseler Nachrichten'', another Swiss newspaper, reported that \"a maximum of only one and a half million Jews could be numbered as casualties.\"<ref>Harwood, p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref> Harwood fails to mention that a later article in a later edition of the newspaper acknowledges that the previous article was incorrect, and 5,800,000 was an accurate number of victims.<ref>''Baseler Nachrichten'', October 7, 1952; Aronsfeld, ''The Text of the Holocaust'', p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, ''Denying the Holocaust''.</ref> Critics cite this as an example of deniers using partial information to distort legitimate sources.<ref>Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref>\n\n===Jewish population===\nOne Holocaust denial argument is the comparison of the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They state that the 1940 [[World Almanac]] gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1948 ''World Almanac'' gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deaths of millions of Jews, cannot have happened to any extent similar to the claimed 6 million. [[Ken McVay]] writes:\n<blockquote>Only in 1949 are postwar estimates employed, the figures given are for estimates made in 1948. A year or two lag seems to be common for various other population estimates given by the World Almanac. The difference between the 1938 and 1948 figures is thus 4,481,491.\n\nIn 1949, however, the World Almanac gives '''a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520'''. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.<ref>[http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/worldalmanac.html \"The World Almanac Gambit\"], Deceit & Misrepresentation: The Techniques of Holocaust Denial, [[Nizkor Project]] website. Retrieved December 6, 2009.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOther sources confirm similar numbers\u2014and earlier than the 1949 ''World Almanac''\u2014for the Jewish population before and after the war. The 1932 ''American Jewish Yearbook'' estimates the total number of Jews in the world at 15,192,218, of whom 9,418,248 resided in Europe. However, the 1947 yearbook states: \"Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic available at the present time. The figures reveal that the total Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third from about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million European Jews. In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.\" These numbers are also consistent with the findings of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104080919/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/anglo/angap03.htm Appendix III], in 1946.\n\n===Nazi documentation===\n[[Image:Hoefletelegram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The H\u00f6fle Telegram.]]\nThe Nazis used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the [[Wannsee Conference]]. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the [[Korherr Report]], which gave the status of the [[Final Solution]] through December 1942. The [[H\u00f6fle Telegram]] was sent by SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Hermann H\u00f6fle on January 11, 1943 to SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Berlin and detailed the number of deaths of Jews in the concentration camps.<ref name=\"roberthanyok\">{{cite web| last = Hanyok |first = Robert |title = Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939-1945 |year=2004 |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |url = https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/eavesdropping.pdf|page = 80}}</ref> In the year 1942 alone, the telegram lists 1,274,166 Jews were exterminated<ref name=\"roberthanyok\"/> in the four camps of [[Aktion Reinhard]].\nThe [[Korherr Report]] compiled by an SS statistician, gave a conservative total of 2,454,000 Jews deported to extermination camps or killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The complete status reports of the Einsatzgruppen death squads were found in the archives of the Gestapo when it was searched by the U.S. Army, and the accuracy attested to by the former Einsatzgruppen members who testified during war crime trials and at other times. These reports alone list an additional 1,500,000 or so murders during mass shootings, the vast majority of these victims were Jews. Further, surviving Nazi documentation spells out their plans to murder the Jews of Europe (see the [[Wannsee Conference]]), recorded the trains arriving at various death camps, and included photographs and films of many atrocities.\n\n===Testimonies===\nThere are voluminous amounts of testimony from thousands of survivors of the Holocaust,<ref>See for example here: [http://sfi.usc.edu/vha/indexing Cataloguing and Indexing]; [[##USC Shoah Foundation Institute]]</ref> as well as the testimony of captured Nazi officers at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and other times.<ref>Other [http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/ Trials] by the Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team</ref> Holocaust deniers discount the testimony of officers claiming that these witnesses were tortured<ref name=Assertions/> or that [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] allegedly signed a confession written in a language he did not understand ([[English language|English]]) or that the Nuremberg Trial did not follow proper judicial procedures.

Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1 million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers. And third, Holocaust deniers contend that the death toll of European Jews during World War II was well below 6 million.

This is often cited as evidence that gas was not used in the chambers, as no trace amounts remain. Despite the difficulty of finding traces of this material 50 years later, in February, 1990, Professor [[Jan Markiewicz]], Director of the [[Institute of Forensic Research]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], redid the analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/ |title=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz & Birkenau Concentration Camps |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> Markiewicz and his team used [[microdiffusion]] techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz.

(In some of the gas chambers the Zyklon B was poured in through the roof, while in others it was thrown in through the windows.) The roof was dynamited at war's end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper. Their location in the concrete matches with eyewitness testimony, aerial photos from 1944, and a ground photo from 1943. The physical evidence shows unmistakably that the Zyklon holes were cast into the concrete when the building was constructed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/genocide/deniers_06.shtml Denying the Holocaust] by [[Deborah Lipstadt]] BBC History. p.6</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]\n\nLeuchter's comment that the camp was \"untouched\" has been dismissed as nonsense by the Holocaust scholar [[Robert Jan van Pelt]], who explains that the absence of most of the would-be rubble from the crematoria is because the local Polish population returning to the area after the war rebuilt farmhouses to the west with bricks salvaged from rubble in the camp area including from the [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] crematoria.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html|title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=|year=2006|first=Errol|last=Morris|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother piece of evidence Holocaust deniers frequently question is what happened to the ash after the bodies were cremated. The amount of ash produced in the [[cremation]] of a person is about a shoebox full, if done in a proper crematorium. However, eyewitness testimonies documented by Hilberg's ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' describe the burning process used in [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] to have carried out in multiple open-air grills where stacks of bodies were burned on top of metal bars. These grills were operated by burning piles of wood underneath.\n\nCremation in the open at the [[Operation Reinhard|Reinhard]] death camps (Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec) was discussed at [[Nuremberg]] on the 7th April 1946 by [[Georg Konrad Morgen]], [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS judge]] and lawyer who investigated crimes committed in Nazi concentration camps. He stated: \"The whole thing was like an assembly line. At the last stop they reached a big room, and were told that this was the bath. When the last one was in, the doors were shut and the gas was let into the room. As soon as death taken place in (''sic''), the ventilators were started. When the air was breathable, the doors were opened, and the Jewish workers removed the bodies. By means of a special process which [[Christian Wirth|Wirth]] had invented, they were burned in the open air without the use of fuel.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-20/tgmwc-20-197-10.shtml |title=Trials of German Major War Criminals: Volume 20 |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\nThere is well-documented evidence that other ash was used as fertilizer in nearby fields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shofar FTP Archive File: camps/maidanek//maidanek.04|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/maidanek/ftp.cgi?camps/maidanek//maidanek.04|website=nizkor.org|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=31 December 1994}}</ref><ref>[[Nuremberg trials|International Military Tribunal]], vol. 1, p. 252</ref> Photographs of Treblinka taken by the camp commandant show what looks to be ash piles being distributed by steam shovels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/Treblinka/appendixd/ |title=Appendix D - Ash Disposal and Mass Graves at Treblinka |publisher=The Holocaust History Project |accessdate=2015-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903011056/http://www.holocaust-history.org/Treblinka/appendixd/ |archivedate=2015-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nAnother argument used by Holocaust deniers is that testimony on the gas chambers is unreliable. The [[Institute for Historical Review]] is one of the organizations which make this assertion. In the words of the IHR:\n<blockquote>[[Rudolf Hoess|H\u00f6ss]] said in his confession that his men would smoke cigarettes as they pulled the dead Jews out of the gas chambers ten minutes after gassing. Isn't Zyklon-B explosive? Highly so.

A much-quoted instance of disputing the toll is the \"Breitbard Document\" (actually a paper by Aaron Breitbart),<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Aaron Breitbart]]|title=Responses to Revisionist Arguments|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|website=motlc.wiesenthal.com|publisher=[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]|accessdate=10 January 2017|location=[[Los Angeles]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403232419/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  which describes a commemorative plaque at Auschwitz to the victims that died there, which reads: \"Four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.\" In 1990, a new plaque replaced the old one. It now says, \"May this place where the Nazis assassinated 1,500,000 men, women and children, a majority of them Jews from diverse European countries, be forever for mankind a cry of despair and of warning.\" The lower numbers are due to the fact that the Soviets \"purposely overstated the number of non-Jewish casualties at Auschwitz-Birkenau,\" according to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. Holocaust deniers insist that the number of Jews killed therefore be lowered by at least 2.5 million. However, the plaque had never been used as an accurate historical source by mainstream historians.<ref>Hilberg, R. Op. Cit.</ref><ref>Dawidowicz, L., The War Against the Jews.

Harwood) could only claim that the ICRC had found no evidence of a policy to exterminate Jews by ignoring key sections of the 1948 report, where the ICRC explicitly states that the systematic extermination of Jews was Nazi policy.<ref name=\"Lipstadt114-5\">Lipstadt, p. 114/115.</ref>\n\nHarwood disputed the notion that homicidal gas chambers were disguised as shower facilities by citing references in the report where ICRC officials inspected bathing facilities. He used their responses to argue that showers functioned as showers and were not part of a killing installation. However this is considered misrepresentation by critics, as the passage Harwood cited is in reference to Allied camps for civilians in Egypt and thus had nothing to do with Nazi concentration camps.<ref name=Lipstadt115>Lipstadt, p. 115.</ref>\n[[Image:ICRC letter - traceable deaths only.jpg|thumb|left|A letter from the Sonderstandesamt (special registry office)\n at [[Bad Arolsen]] regarding only deaths at Nazi concentration camps that were registered by this institution (not to be confused with the numbers of deaths officially registered in the camps themselves).

Note that the English translations are not a part of the original document and are incorrect: the document does not come from the Red Cross. \"Anzahl\" means \"count\", \"number\" and not \"Total Deaths\".]]\n\nHarwood also claimed that ''[[:de:Die Tat (Schweizer Zeitung)|Die Tat]]'', a Swiss tabloid newspaper, published statistics that concluded the number of people who died in Nazi prisons and camps from 1939 to 1945 based on ICRC statistics was \"300,000, not all of whom were Jews\".<ref name=Lipstadt116>Lipstadt, p. 116.</ref> The January 19, 1955 edition of Die Tat did indeed give a 300,000 figure, but this was only in reference to \"Germans and German Jews\" and not nationals of other countries.<ref name=Lipstadt117>Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref> In the 1978 official bulletin, entitled \"False Propaganda\", the ICRC denounced Holocaust denial and confirmed that the agency \"Never published\u2014or even compiled\u2014statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it\" and stated that its mission was \"to help war victims, not to count them\",<ref name=Bulletin25>ICRC ''Bulletin No. 25, Feb. 1, 1978'', cited in Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Robert|title=Holocaust Denial and the Law: A Comparative Study|date=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=9781403980502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svfFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\">{{cite journal|title=Red cross exposure of \"false propaganda\"|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|date=January 1978|volume=12|issue=2|page=11|doi=10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431|issn=0031-322X}}</ref> and questioned how they would have even been able to obtain such statistics had they wanted to, given that they were \"only able to enter only a few concentration camps...in the final days of the war\".<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The agency states that the figures used are \"the number of deaths recorded by the [[International Tracing Service]] on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and accordingly bear no relation to the total death tolls, since the Nazis destroyed much documentation, and that many deaths occurred in camps where prisoners were generally not registered.<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The ICRC considers this misrepresentation as \"propaganda\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and because these claims regarding the ICRC were used for the defense of [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] at his trial in 1985, critics state that despite the agency's attempts to demonstrate the truth, Holocaust deniers have continued to rely on ICRC based disinformation.<ref name=Lipstadt117/> Archives of the International Tracing Service (located in [[Bad Arolsen]]) responding to such misrepresentation can be found here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/index.html |title=Archives |publisher=Its-Arolsen.Org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\nIn 1979, the ICRC stated a second time that they have \"never tried to compile statistics on the victims of the war\",<ref name=icrc300000>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/international/red-cross/ftp.py?orgs/international/red-cross//300000-victims.response |title=Comite International De La Croix-Rouge |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> nor \"certified the accuracy of the statistics produced by a third party\",<ref name=icrc300000/> and state that the authors of such material have \"falsified\" both claims that the document originates from the ICRC and refers exclusively to Jews.<ref name=icrc300000/>\n\nAs well as in personal correspondence, the ICRC has also addressed this misrepresentation by several other means. In 1975, the ICRC wrote to the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] in [[London]] regarding Harwood's citations, stating:\n{{quote|The figures cited by the author of the booklet are based upon statistics falsely attributed to us, evidently for the purpose of giving them credibility, despite the fact that we never publish information of this kind.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suzman|first1=Arthur|last2=Diamond|first2=Denis|title=Six million did die: the truth shall prevail Arthur Suzman and Denis Diamond|date=1978|publisher=South African Jewish Board of Deputies|isbn=978-0620031288|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GEJAQAAIAAJ&q=The+figures+cited+by+the+author+of+the+booklet+are+based+upon+statistics+falsely+attributed+to+us,+evidently+for+the+purpose+of+giving+them+credibility,+despite+the+fact+that+we+never+publish+information+of+this+kind}}</ref>|Fran\u00e7oise Perret|''Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge, to Jacob Gewirtz, August 22, 1975.''}}\n\n====Baseler Nachrichten====\nSimilarly, Harwood wrote that the June 4, 1946 edition of ''Baseler Nachrichten'', another Swiss newspaper, reported that \"a maximum of only one and a half million Jews could be numbered as casualties.\"<ref>Harwood, p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref> Harwood fails to mention that a later article in a later edition of the newspaper acknowledges that the previous article was incorrect, and 5,800,000 was an accurate number of victims.<ref>''Baseler Nachrichten'', October 7, 1952; Aronsfeld, ''The Text of the Holocaust'', p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, ''Denying the Holocaust''.</ref> Critics cite this as an example of deniers using partial information to distort legitimate sources.<ref>Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref>\n\n===Jewish population===\nOne Holocaust denial argument is the comparison of the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They state that the 1940 [[World Almanac]] gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1948 ''World Almanac'' gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deaths of millions of Jews, cannot have happened to any extent similar to the claimed 6 million. [[Ken McVay]] writes:\n<blockquote>Only in 1949 are postwar estimates employed, the figures given are for estimates made in 1948. A year or two lag seems to be common for various other population estimates given by the World Almanac. The difference between the 1938 and 1948 figures is thus 4,481,491.\n\nIn 1949, however, the World Almanac gives '''a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520'''. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.<ref>[http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/worldalmanac.html \"The World Almanac Gambit\"], Deceit & Misrepresentation: The Techniques of Holocaust Denial, [[Nizkor Project]] website. Retrieved December 6, 2009.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOther sources confirm similar numbers\u2014and earlier than the 1949 ''World Almanac''\u2014for the Jewish population before and after the war. The 1932 ''American Jewish Yearbook'' estimates the total number of Jews in the world at 15,192,218, of whom 9,418,248 resided in Europe. However, the 1947 yearbook states: \"Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic available at the present time. The figures reveal that the total Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third from about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million European Jews. In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.\" These numbers are also consistent with the findings of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104080919/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/anglo/angap03.htm Appendix III], in 1946.\n\n===Nazi documentation===\n[[Image:Hoefletelegram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The H\u00f6fle Telegram.]]\nThe Nazis used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the [[Wannsee Conference]]. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the [[Korherr Report]], which gave the status of the [[Final Solution]] through December 1942. The [[H\u00f6fle Telegram]] was sent by SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Hermann H\u00f6fle on January 11, 1943 to SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Berlin and detailed the number of deaths of Jews in the concentration camps.<ref name=\"roberthanyok\">{{cite web| last = Hanyok |first = Robert |title = Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939-1945 |year=2004 |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |url = https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/eavesdropping.pdf|page = 80}}</ref> In the year 1942 alone, the telegram lists 1,274,166 Jews were exterminated<ref name=\"roberthanyok\"/> in the four camps of [[Aktion Reinhard]].\nThe [[Korherr Report]] compiled by an SS statistician, gave a conservative total of 2,454,000 Jews deported to extermination camps or killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The complete status reports of the Einsatzgruppen death squads were found in the archives of the Gestapo when it was searched by the U.S. Army, and the accuracy attested to by the former Einsatzgruppen members who testified during war crime trials and at other times. These reports alone list an additional 1,500,000 or so murders during mass shootings, the vast majority of these victims were Jews. Further, surviving Nazi documentation spells out their plans to murder the Jews of Europe (see the [[Wannsee Conference]]), recorded the trains arriving at various death camps, and included photographs and films of many atrocities.\n\n===Testimonies===\nThere are voluminous amounts of testimony from thousands of survivors of the Holocaust,<ref>See for example here: [http://sfi.usc.edu/vha/indexing Cataloguing and Indexing]; [[##USC Shoah Foundation Institute]]</ref> as well as the testimony of captured Nazi officers at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and other times.<ref>Other [http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/ Trials] by the Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team</ref> Holocaust deniers discount the testimony of officers claiming that these witnesses were tortured<ref name=Assertions/> or that [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] allegedly signed a confession written in a language he did not understand ([[English language|English]]) or that the Nuremberg Trial did not follow proper judicial procedures.

There were Jewish prisoners who helped march Jews to the gas chambers, and later dragged the bodies to the crematoria.  Since they witnessed the entire process, their testimony is vital in confirming that the gas chambers were used for murderous purposes and the scale to which they were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/auschwitz/auschwitz-faq-10.html |title=The Nizkor Project - Command staff |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\nOther key testimony comes from non-Jewish survivors of the camps such as Catholic [[French Resistance]] member [[Andr\u00e9 Rogerie]] who was held in seven different camps, and who as a member of the Resistance was not targeted for extermination but for hard labor and survived.
