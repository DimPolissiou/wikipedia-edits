{"title_page": "Port, Templeport", "text_new": "[[File:Port, Templeport.jpg|thumb|Road beside Templeport Lough, County Cavan, Ireland, heading west.]]\n\n'''Port''' ({{Irish derived place name|Port meaning 'A Landing-Place'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. Port is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme'' (probably Irish 'Achadh an Mhanaigh' meaning \"The Field of the Monk\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf|title=National Archives Dublin}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html|title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map|website=www.templeport.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan|title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project|website=downsurvey.tcd.ie}}</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html Templeport Development Association - 1809 Templeport map]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html Bawnboy and Templeport History Heritage and Folklore St Mogue of Templeport]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. Port is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme'' (probably Irish 'Achadh an Mhanaigh' meaning \"The Field of the Monk\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf|title=National Archives Dublin}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html|title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map|website=www.templeport.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan|title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project|website=downsurvey.tcd.ie}}</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html Templeport Development Association - 1809 Templeport map]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html Bawnboy and Templeport History Heritage and Folklore St Mogue of Templeport]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good.

CBC has not been able to contact Mr. Fowkes to review his overall position in light of this and the information he provided earlier.\n\nAARC has also sued four female sources, all of whom appeared in the programme. AARC alleges in those lawsuits that some aspects of the Powerless programme were inaccurate, including several of the statements made by former AARC clients, and broadcast by CBC. For legal reasons, AARC has not been able to provide the CBC with details from some of those lawsuits. Each of the sources is defending the actions. Some have filed counterclaims against AARC.\n\nOn 15 April 2011, AARC commenced a lawsuit against the CBC. The CBC is defending the action.

The dogs generally survived a few days; one survived 29 days. The grafted body parts were able to move and react to stimulus. The animals died due to [[transplant rejection]].<ref name=Lamba2017rev/>\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, [[immunosuppressive drug]]s and [[organ transplantation]] techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys, livers, and other organs standard medical procedures.<ref name=Lamba2017rev/>\n\nIn 1965, [[Robert J. White]] did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs, to learn how to manage this challenge. He monitored brain activity with EEG and also monitored [[metabolism]], and showed that he could maintain high levels of brain activity and metabolism by avoiding any break in the blood supply. The animals survived between 6 hours and 2 days. In 1970, he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems. White used [[Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest|deep hypothermia]] to protect the brains during the times when they were cut off from blood during procedure. The recipient bodies had to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation and drugs to stimulate the heart. The grafted heads were able to function - the [[Eye movement|eyes tracked]] moving objects and it could chew and swallow. There were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming, and White used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted.<ref name=Lamba2017rev/> These experiments were reported and criticized in the media and were considered barbaric by animal rights activists.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> There were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nIn 2012, [[Xiaoping Ren]] published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse's body; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months.<ref name=Lamba2017rev/>\n\nIn 2013, [[Sergio Canavero]] published a protocol that he said would make human head transplantation possible.<ref name=NS>{{cite news|title=Sergio Canavero: Will His Head Transplants Roll? - Neuroskeptic|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/05/13/canavero-head-transplants/|work=Neuroskeptic|date=13 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Canavero|first1=S|title=HEAVEN: The head anastomosis venture Project outline for the first human head transplantation with spinal linkage (GEMINI).|journal=Surgical Neurology International|date=2013|volume=4|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S335\u201342|pmid=24244881|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.113444|pmc=3821155}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place, and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support.

These continued as other organs were transplanted, but perhaps became the most sharp as [[hand transplant]]s and [[face transplants]] emerged in 1998 and 2005, as each of these are visible, personal, and social in ways that internal organs are not.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> The [[medical ethics]] of each of these procedures was extensively discussed and worked out before clinical experimental and regular usage began.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nWith regard to head transplantation, there had been little formal ethical discussion published in the literature and little dialogue among stakeholders {{as of|2017|lc=y}}; the plans of Canavero were running well ahead of society's and the medical establishment's readiness or acceptance.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> There was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved, methods of obtaining [[informed consent]] were unclear, especially for the person whose body would be used; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> With regard to societal costs, the body of a person willing to be an [[organ donor]] can save the lives of many people, and {{as of|2017|lc=y}} the supply of tissues and organs from people willing to be organ donors did not meet the medical need of recipients; the notion of an entire donor body going to one other person was difficult to justify at that time.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> Basic legal issues were also unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}} with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nThe most appropriate initial form of the procedure was unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time, the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body, leaving the person completely paralyzed, with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nThe psychological results of the procedure were unclear as well. While concerns were raised about whether recipients of a face transplant and their social circle would have difficulty adjusting, studies {{as of|2017|lc=y}} had found that disruptions had been minimal. But no transplant had ever been performed where the entire body of an individual is unfamiliar at the conclusion of the procedure, and one of the few documents discussing the ethics in the biomedical literature, a letter to the editor of a journal published in 2015, foresaw a high risk of insanity as a result of the procedure.<ref name=Furr2017rev/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cartolovni|first1=Anto|last2=Spagnolo|first2=AntonioG|title=Ethical considerations regarding head transplantation|journal=Surgical Neurology International|date=2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=103|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.158785|pmid=26110084|pmc=4476134}}</ref>\n\nPopular opinion about Canavero's plans for head transplantation had been generally negative {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530103.700-first-human-head-transplant-could-happen-in-two-years.html?page=2|title=First human head transplant could happen in two years|author=Helen Thomson|work=New Scientist|url-access=registration }}</ref> Many of these criticisms focus on the state of technology and the timeframe in which Canavero says he will be able to successfully conduct the procedure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fecht|first=Sarah|title=BNo, human head transplants will not be possible by 2017|url=http://www.popsci.com/no-human-head-transplants-will-not-be-possible-2017|accessdate=March 6, 2015|newspaper=Popular Science|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/27031329/man-volunteers-for-world-first-head-transplant-operation/|title=Man volunteers for world first head transplant operation|access-date=April 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410010522/https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/27031329/man-volunteers-for-world-first-head-transplant-operation/|archive-date=April 10, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n'''Literature'''\n*''[[Professor Dowell's Head]]'' (1925), science-fiction novel by Alexander Belyaev\n*[[Arthur Nagan]] or \"Gorilla-Man\", Marvel Comics character that transplanted his head onto a gorilla's body\n*''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' (1987), [[Dio Brando]], the main antagonist, transplanted his head on [[Jonathan Joestar]]'s body, the main protagonist, between ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' and ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''.\n*''NOGGIN'' (2014) by [[John Corey Whaley]]; Travis Coates wakes up after undergoing a head transplant after five years of being [[Cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://johncoreywhaley.com/untitled/ | title=NOGGIN}}</ref>\n'''Film'''\n*''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'' (1962), science-fiction/horror film\n*''[[The Thing with Two Heads]]'' (1972), science fiction film\n*''[[The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant]]'' (1971), science fiction/horror film\n*''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe ]]'' (2008), science fiction film\n'''Video games'''\n*[[B.J.

The dogs generally survived a few days; one survived 29 days. The grafted body parts were able to move and react to stimulus. The animals died due to [[transplant rejection]].<ref name=Lamba2017rev/>\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, [[immunosuppressive drug]]s and [[organ transplantation]] techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys, livers, and other organs standard medical procedures.<ref name=Lamba2017rev/>\n\nIn 1965, [[Robert J. White]] did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs, to learn how to manage this challenge. He monitored brain activity with EEG and also monitored [[metabolism]], and showed that he could maintain high levels of brain activity and metabolism by avoiding any break in the blood supply. The animals survived between 6 hours and 2 days. In 1970, he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems. White used [[Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest|deep hypothermia]] to protect the brains during the times when they were cut off from blood during procedure. The recipient bodies had to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation and drugs to stimulate the heart. The grafted heads were able to function - the [[Eye movement|eyes tracked]] moving objects and it could chew and swallow. There were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming, and White used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted.<ref name=Lamba2017rev/> These experiments were reported and criticized in the media and were considered barbaric by animal rights activists.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> There were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nIn 2012, [[Xiaoping Ren]] published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse's body; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months.<ref name=Lamba2017rev/>\n\nIn 2013, [[Sergio Canavero]] published a protocol that he said would make human head transplantation possible.<ref name=NS>{{cite news|title=Sergio Canavero: Will His Head Transplants Roll? - Neuroskeptic|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/05/13/canavero-head-transplants/|work=Neuroskeptic|date=13 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Canavero|first1=S|title=HEAVEN: The head anastomosis venture Project outline for the first human head transplantation with spinal linkage (GEMINI).|journal=Surgical Neurology International|date=2013|volume=4|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S335\u201342|pmid=24244881|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.113444|pmc=3821155}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place, and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support.

These continued as other organs were transplanted, but perhaps became the most sharp as [[hand transplant]]s and [[face transplants]] emerged in 1998 and 2005, as each of these are visible, personal, and social in ways that internal organs are not.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> The [[medical ethics]] of each of these procedures was extensively discussed and worked out before clinical experimental and regular usage began.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nWith regard to head transplantation, there had been little formal ethical discussion published in the literature and little dialogue among stakeholders {{as of|2017|lc=y}}; the plans of Canavero were running well ahead of society's and the medical establishment's readiness or acceptance.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> There was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved, methods of obtaining [[informed consent]] were unclear, especially for the person whose body would be used; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> With regard to societal costs, the body of a person willing to be an [[organ donor]] can save the lives of many people, and {{as of|2017|lc=y}} the supply of tissues and organs from people willing to be organ donors did not meet the medical need of recipients; the notion of an entire donor body going to one other person was difficult to justify at that time.<ref name=Furr2017rev/> Basic legal issues were also unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}} with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nThe most appropriate initial form of the procedure was unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time, the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body, leaving the person completely paralyzed, with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain.<ref name=Furr2017rev/>\n\nThe psychological results of the procedure were unclear as well. While concerns were raised about whether recipients of a face transplant and their social circle would have difficulty adjusting, studies {{as of|2017|lc=y}} had found that disruptions had been minimal. But no transplant had ever been performed where the entire body of an individual is unfamiliar at the conclusion of the procedure, and one of the few documents discussing the ethics in the biomedical literature, a letter to the editor of a journal published in 2015, foresaw a high risk of insanity as a result of the procedure.<ref name=Furr2017rev/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cartolovni|first1=Anto|last2=Spagnolo|first2=AntonioG|title=Ethical considerations regarding head transplantation|journal=Surgical Neurology International|date=2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=103|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.158785|pmid=26110084|pmc=4476134}}</ref>\n\nPopular opinion about Canavero's plans for head transplantation had been generally negative {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530103.700-first-human-head-transplant-could-happen-in-two-years.html?page=2|title=First human head transplant could happen in two years|author=Helen Thomson|work=New Scientist|url-access=registration }}</ref> Many of these criticisms focus on the state of technology and the timeframe in which Canavero says he will be able to successfully conduct the procedure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fecht|first=Sarah|title=BNo, human head transplants will not be possible by 2017|url=http://www.popsci.com/no-human-head-transplants-will-not-be-possible-2017|accessdate=March 6, 2015|newspaper=Popular Science|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/27031329/man-volunteers-for-world-first-head-transplant-operation/|title=Man volunteers for world first head transplant operation|access-date=April 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410010522/https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/27031329/man-volunteers-for-world-first-head-transplant-operation/|archive-date=April 10, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n'''Literature'''\n*''[[Professor Dowell's Head]]'' (1925), science-fiction novel by Alexander Belyaev\n*[[Arthur Nagan]] or \"Gorilla-Man\", Marvel Comics character that transplanted his head onto a gorilla's body\n*''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' (1987), [[Dio Brando]], the main antagonist, transplanted his head on [[Jonathan Joestar]]'s body, the main protagonist, between ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' and ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''.\n*''NOGGIN'' (2014) by [[John Corey Whaley]]; Travis Coates wakes up after undergoing a head transplant after five years of being [[Cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://johncoreywhaley.com/untitled/ | title=NOGGIN}}</ref>\n'''Film'''\n*''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'' (1962), science-fiction/horror film\n*''[[The Thing with Two Heads]]'' (1972), science fiction film\n*''[[The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant]]'' (1971), science fiction/horror film\n*''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe ]]'' (2008), science fiction film\n'''Video games'''\n*[[B.J.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nCloneary is bounded on the north by [[Port, Templeport]] and [[Cor, Templeport]] townlands, on the west by [[Ray, Templeport]] townland, on the south by [[Rosehill, Templeport]] and [[Gortnaleck]] townlands and on the east by [[Lissanover]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Gortnaleck Lough, a stream and a dug well. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- ''The soil is light and is intermixed with limestone which is burned and used for manure.''\nCloneary is traversed by minor public roads, rural lanes and the disused [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]]. The townland covers 142 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Clonerin''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Killelery''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Cownaren''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\nCloneary formed part of the \"termon lands\"<ref>[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/territorial_divisions/termon_lands.htm Termon Lands, etc] Clare Library</ref> or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and  kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Cloneary was one of these four polls.\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the farm, termons or hospitals of Tampleporte containing 4 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 10 shillings'' to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]]. Cloneary was one of these pulls.\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a further lease of ''the farms, termons or hospitals of Templeport containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 13 shillings'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]].'' Cloneary was one of these pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Cloneary was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. Cloneary formed part of this lease.\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Templepart'' to Oliver Lambert's son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''The Lord of Cavan'' (i.e. [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]]).\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Clonehiren''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts ''Clonery'' as still belonging to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]].

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nCloneary is bounded on the north by [[Port, Templeport]] and [[Cor, Templeport]] townlands, on the west by [[Ray, Templeport]] townland, on the south by [[Rosehill, Templeport]] and [[Gortnaleck]] townlands and on the east by [[Lissanover]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Gortnaleck Lough, a stream and a dug well. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- ''The soil is light and is intermixed with limestone which is burned and used for manure.''\nCloneary is traversed by minor public roads, rural lanes and the disused [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]]. The townland covers 142 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Clonerin''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Killelery''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Cownaren''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\nCloneary formed part of the \"termon lands\"<ref>[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/territorial_divisions/termon_lands.htm Termon Lands, etc] Clare Library</ref> or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and  kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Cloneary was one of these four polls.\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the farm, termons or hospitals of Tampleporte containing 4 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 10 shillings'' to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]]. Cloneary was one of these pulls.\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a further lease of ''the farms, termons or hospitals of Templeport containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 13 shillings'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]].'' Cloneary was one of these pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Cloneary was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. Cloneary formed part of this lease.\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Templepart'' to Oliver Lambert's son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''The Lord of Cavan''.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Clonehiren''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts ''Clonery'' as still belonging to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]].

It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on March 7, 2007 and was rated [[TV-MA-L]]. In the episode, [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] uses the [[racial slur]] \"[[nigger]]s\" on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', leading to widespread public outrage. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] attempts to understand the epithet's impact on his black friend [[Token Black|Token]]. Meanwhile, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] has a hard time trying to teach [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to be sensitive.\n\nParker and Stone had long wanted to create an episode exploring the racial slur, but struggled with a plot line beyond its opening scene. They subsequently found it easier to work on following comedian [[Michael Richards]]' controversy, in which he screamed the slur at black audience members who had heckled him during his comedy act. \n\nDespite the frequent usage of the racial slur, the episode attracted very little media attention. [[Parents Television Council]] founder [[L. Brent Bozell III|L. Brent Bozell]] criticized the lack of protest against the episode. The group Abolish the \"N\" Word, which is linked with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], praised the episode, calling it a good example of the word's impact on individuals. The episode was critically acclaimed by contemporary television critics, who praised the episode's humor and storyline. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 2.8 million viewers the week it was broadcast. \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" was released on DVD along with the rest of the eleventh season on August 12, 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] is on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and has made it to the bonus round. The episode is airing live, with his family watching him from the audience and the South Park residents watching from home. He has to solve a puzzle in the category \"People Who Annoy You\", and is given the letters R, T, S, L, and E. Randy adds the letters B, N, G, and O, after which the puzzle spells \"N_GGERS\". Randy, hesitant to say the answer due to its pejorative nature, is given 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. But when host [[Pat Sajak]] tells Randy that he has five seconds left, he reluctantly yells out \"[[niggers]]!\", which shocks fans, as well as his family and friends, and angers [[African-American]] members of the audience. The correct answer is then revealed to be \"naggers\".\n\nStan goes to school the next day, knowing his father had just said the N-word over live television. Cartman confronts him, saying that Token will be mad at him for his actions. He goes to Token to try and explain, saying his father isn't racist but is just stupid. Cartman, seeing an opportunity to cause conflict, tries to get the two into a \"[[Race War]]\". Token, instead of fighting, walks away. Cartman sees this as a forfeit, and also runs away screaming \"Whites Win!\"\n\nSeeking forgiveness, Randy visits [[Jesse Jackson]] to apologize. Jackson bends over his desk and tells Randy to apologize by [[wikt:kiss my ass|kissing his buttocks]]. Randy does so and a picture is taken, which is then put into the news. Stan seeks out Token, expecting everything to be better now since his dad apologized, yet Token is still mad, saying, \"Jesse Jackson is not the emperor of black people!\" To which Stan replies, \"He told my dad he was.\"\n\nThe school, in light of the recent events, hires a smart man and author suffering from [[dwarfism]] named Dr. David Nelson who goes from school to school to talk to students about sensitivity. As soon as Dr. Nelson walks on stage, Cartman laughs hysterically. At first, Dr. Nelson believes that he would tire himself out but realizes that he has no chance to talk, even after Mr. Mackey walks on stage ordering Cartman to be quiet. Randy then goes to a comedy club, but he is singled out by the black comedian resembling [[Chris Rock]], who calls Randy the \"Nigger-Guy.\" Thereafter, everyone in town uses the name against Randy, making him feel like an outcast. Back at school, Dr. Nelson talks to Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey about Cartman and asks them to have him meet with him. When Cartman comes in though, all he can do is laugh and make fun of him. Dr. Nelson keeps on saying that Eric's words don't hurt him, but as Cartman keeps on laughing, Dr. Nelson loses his temper and yells at him saying, \"Shut your fucking mouth,\" which shocks both Mackey and Victoria. Stan once again confronts Token, but this time to say he understands how Token feels about the N-word after how he saw Cartman laugh at Dr. Nelson. Still mad, Token says that he does not really think Stan understands. After this, Dr. Nelson calls all of the students to the Gymnasium to teach Cartman a lesson by making fun of his weight problem with the words \"Hello Fatso!\" when he walks in so he understands how it feels. They do this, and Cartman responds angrily, but when Dr. Nelson comes out to scold him again, he breaks up in laughter again. Meanwhile, in further attempts to clear his name, Randy opens up the Randy Marsh African American Scholarship Foundation. When walking away from the grand opening, he is chased by a trio of socially progressive rednecks carrying shotguns, who are angry at him for slandering an entire race of people. However, other \"Nigger-Guys,\" led by Michael Richards from ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and including [[Mark Fuhrman]], rescue him and scare the rednecks off. Michael Richards introduces Randy to other Nigger-Guys and accepts him into their ranks.\n\nStan gets fed up with Token, and demands to know why he's still angry. The two are interrupted by Butters who tells them Cartman is going to fight Dr. Nelson in the town's park, and the three run off to go see. Before the fight, Kyle warns Cartman that Dr. Nelson is a karate black belt. After Dr. Nelson announces to beat Cartman to prove his point, which is words shouldn't hurt him, the two begin to wrestle wherein Cartman easily gets the upper hand. Later in [[Washington D.C.]], the \"Nigger-Guys\" are pleading their case to the Senate to ban the word \"Nigger-Guy.\" The Motion is passed by the Senate and as a result, anyone saying the words \"nigger\" and \"guy\" within seven words of each other would be prosecuted and fined. Back in the park, Dr. Nelson gives up after being pinned by Cartman, who forces him to submit by saying \"Uncle\" and [[Poltergeist (1982 film)|\"Carol Anne, don't go into the light\"]]. As Cartman gloats about his victory, Dr. Nelson rises and kicks Cartman to the ground. However, Cartman remains unfazed and continues to laugh. An angered Dr. Nelson storms off, saying he 'proved' his point, which all the students have forgotten. It is then that Stan understands that he doesn't get it. He tells Token that he will never understand how it feels to have the N-word against him because he isn't black, which was what Token was looking to hear all along and they reconcile.\n\n==Production==\n\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" was the season premiere of ''South Park''{{'s}} eleventh season, and the first episode of the show's spring 2007 run, which consists of seven episodes. Parker and Stone had wanted to create an episode centered on the racial slur \"nigger\" for a considerable time.<ref name=\"Stone\">{{Cite video | people=Stone, Matt| date=August 2008 |title=South Park: The Complete Eleventh Season: \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref> The first scene, in which Randy uses the word on ''Wheel of Fortune'', was the first idea for the episode and remained the only idea for a while; Parker called the scene \"one of my favorite things we\u2019ve ever done.\"<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\nShortly beforehand, comedian [[Michael Richards]] encountered massive controversy due to a performance at the [[Laugh Factory]] in November 2006, in which he screamed the \u201cN\u201d word repeatedly at a group of African-Americans who heckled him. Parker and Stone decided it would be best, considering the media coverage of the incident, to work on the episode then.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> In the episode's DVD commentary, they noted that it was clear from the video of Richards that he had significant problems, but that they really felt contempt for him when he apologized to civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref name=\"Stone\" /> Staff writer [[Vernon Chatman]], who is half-black, was particularly outraged by this, noting that Jackson \"is not the ambassador of black people\u201d, which inspired the line in the episode where Token says that Jackson \"is not the emperor of black people\". Stan responds by saying \"he told my dad he was\".<ref name=\"Parker\" /> Stone particularly enjoyed the ending of the episode, remarking, \"If there was a word as hateful as the n-word [in how it] applies to black people, if there was a word like that against white people, [they] would make it illegal.\"<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\nThey created the idea of using the epithet to apply to whites only, which was when the rest of the episode began to germinate.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> While they felt the Randy A story was excellent, they wanted to have a B story involving the boys. They came up with the idea of Stan and Token arguing about his father's use of the word, which remained the only subplot idea.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> They continued to struggle with the subplot until roughly three days prior to air, when they created the idea of Cartman encountering a little person.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> They based the little person on an obscure old commercial featuring little people walking around in suits.<ref name=\"Parker\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=August 2008 |title=South Park: The Complete Eleventh Season: \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Reaction===\nThis episode received coverage by the [[CNN]] programs ''[[Showbiz Tonight]]'' and ''[[Paula Zahn Now]]''<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0703/08/pzn.01.html Transcript of \"Paula Zahn Now\" from March 8, 2007].

It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on March 7, 2007 and was rated [[TV-MA-L]]. In the episode, [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] uses the [[racial slur]] \"[[nigger]]s\" on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', leading to widespread public outrage. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] attempts to understand the epithet's impact on his black friend [[Token Black|Token]]. Meanwhile, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] has a hard time trying to teach [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to be sensitive.\n\nParker and Stone had long wanted to create an episode exploring the racial slur, but struggled with a plot line beyond its opening scene. They subsequently found it easier to work on following comedian [[Michael Richards]]' controversy, in which he screamed the slur at black audience members who had heckled him during his comedy act. \n\nDespite the frequent usage of the racial slur, the episode attracted very little media attention. [[Parents Television Council]] founder [[L. Brent Bozell III|L. Brent Bozell]] criticized the lack of protest against the episode. The group Abolish the \"N\" Word, which is linked with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], praised the episode, calling it a good example of the word's impact on individuals. The episode was critically acclaimed by contemporary television critics, who praised the episode's humor and storyline. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 2.8 million viewers the week it was broadcast. \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" was released on DVD along with the rest of the eleventh season on August 12, 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] is on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and has made it to the bonus round. The episode is airing live, with his family watching him from the audience and the South Park residents watching from home. He has to solve a puzzle in the category \"People Who Annoy You\", and is given the letters R, T, S, L, and E. Randy adds the letters B, N, G, and O, after which the puzzle spells \"N_GGERS\". Randy, hesitant to say the answer due to its pejorative nature, is given 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. But when host [[Pat Sajak]] tells Randy that he has five seconds left, he reluctantly yells out \"[[niggers]]!\", which shocks fans, as well as his family and friends, and angers [[African-American]] members of the audience. The correct answer is then revealed to be \"naggers\".\n\nStan goes to school the next day, knowing his father had just said the N-word over live television. Cartman confronts him, saying that Token will be mad at him for his actions. He goes to Token to try and explain, saying his father isn't racist but is just stupid. Cartman, seeing an opportunity to cause conflict, tries to get the two into a \"[[Race War]]\". Token, instead of fighting, walks away. Cartman sees this as a forfeit, and also runs away screaming \"Whites Win!\"\n\nSeeking forgiveness, Randy visits [[Jesse Jackson]] to apologize. Jackson bends over his desk and tells Randy to apologize by [[wikt:kiss my ass|kissing his buttocks]]. Randy does so and a picture is taken, which is then put into the news. Stan seeks out Token, expecting everything to be better now since his dad apologized, yet Token is still mad, saying, \"Jesse Jackson is not the emperor of black people!\" To which Stan replies, \"He told my dad he was.\"\n\nThe school, in light of the recent events, hires a smart man and author suffering from [[dwarfism]] named Dr. David Nelson who goes from school to school to talk to students about sensitivity. As soon as Dr. Nelson walks on stage, Cartman laughs hysterically. At first, Dr. Nelson believes that he would tire himself out but realizes that he has no chance to talk, even after Mr. Mackey walks on stage ordering Cartman to be quiet. Randy then goes to a comedy club, but he is singled out by the black comedian resembling [[Chris Rock]], who calls Randy the \"Nigger-Guy.\" Thereafter, everyone in town uses the name against Randy, making him feel like an outcast. Back at school, Dr. Nelson talks to Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey about Cartman and asks them to have him meet with him. When Cartman comes in though, all he can do is laugh and make fun of him. Dr. Nelson keeps on saying that Eric's words don't hurt him, but as Cartman keeps on laughing, Dr. Nelson loses his temper and yells at him saying, \"Shut your fucking mouth,\" which shocks both Mackey and Victoria. Stan once again confronts Token, but this time to say he understands how Token feels about the N-word after how he saw Cartman laugh at Dr. Nelson. Still mad, Token says that he does not really think Stan understands. After this, Dr. Nelson calls all of the students to the Gymnasium to teach Cartman a lesson by making fun of his weight problem with the words \"Hello Fatso!\" when he walks in so he understands how it feels. They do this, and Cartman responds angrily, but when Dr. Nelson comes out to scold him again, he breaks up in laughter again. Meanwhile, in further attempts to clear his name, Randy opens up the Randy Marsh African American Scholarship Foundation. When walking away from the grand opening, he is chased by a trio of socially progressive rednecks carrying shotguns, who are angry at him for slandering an entire race of people. However, other \"Nigger-Guys,\" led by Michael Richards from ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and including [[Mark Fuhrman]], rescue him and scare the rednecks off. Michael Richards introduces Randy to other Nigger-Guys and accepts him into their ranks.\n\nStan gets fed up with Token, and demands to know why he's still angry. The two are interrupted by Butters who tells them Cartman is going to fight Dr. Nelson in the town's park, and the three run off to go see. Before the fight, Kyle warns Cartman that Dr. Nelson is a karate black belt. After Dr. Nelson announces to beat Cartman to prove his point, which is words shouldn't hurt him, the two begin to wrestle wherein Cartman easily gets the upper hand. Later in [[Washington D.C.]], the \"Nigger-Guys\" are pleading their case to the Senate to ban the word \"Nigger-Guy.\" The Motion is passed by the Senate and as a result, anyone saying the words \"nigger\" and \"guy\" within seven words of each other would be prosecuted and fined. Back in the park, Dr. Nelson gives up after being pinned by Cartman, who forces him to submit by saying \"Uncle\" and [[Poltergeist (1982 film)|\"Carol Anne, don't go into the light\"]]. As Cartman gloats about his victory, Dr. Nelson rises and kicks Cartman to the ground. However, Cartman remains unfazed and continues to laugh. An angered Dr. Nelson storms off, saying he 'proved' his point, which all the students have forgotten. It is then that Stan understands that he doesn't get it. He tells Token that he will never understand how it feels to have the N-word against him because he isn't black, which was what Token was looking to hear all along and they reconcile.\n\n==Production==\n\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" was the season premiere of ''South Park''{{'s}} eleventh season, and the first episode of the show's spring 2007 run, which consists of seven episodes. Parker and Stone had wanted to create an episode centered on the racial slur \"nigger\" for a considerable time.<ref name=\"Stone\">{{Cite video | people=Stone, Matt| date=August 2008 |title=South Park: The Complete Eleventh Season: \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref> The first scene, in which Randy uses the word on ''Wheel of Fortune'', was the first idea for the episode and remained the only idea for a while; Parker called the scene \"one of my favorite things we\u2019ve ever done.\"<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\nShortly beforehand, comedian [[Michael Richards]] encountered massive controversy due to a performance at the [[Laugh Factory]] in November 2006, in which he screamed the \u201cN\u201d word repeatedly at a group of African-Americans who heckled him. Parker and Stone decided it would be best, considering the media coverage of the incident, to work on the episode then.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> In the episode's DVD commentary, they noted that it was clear from the video of Richards that he had significant problems, but that they really felt contempt for him when he apologized to civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref name=\"Stone\" /> Staff writer [[Vernon Chatman]], who is black, was particularly outraged by this, noting that Jackson \"is not the ambassador of black people\u201d, which inspired the line in the episode where Token says that Jackson \"is not the emperor of black people\". Stan responds by saying \"he told my dad he was\".<ref name=\"Parker\" /> Stone particularly enjoyed the ending of the episode, remarking, \"If there was a word as hateful as the n-word [in how it] applies to black people, if there was a word like that against white people, [they] would make it illegal.\"<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\nThey created the idea of using the epithet to apply to whites only, which was when the rest of the episode began to germinate.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> While they felt the Randy A story was excellent, they wanted to have a B story involving the boys. They came up with the idea of Stan and Token arguing about his father's use of the word, which remained the only subplot idea.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> They continued to struggle with the subplot until roughly three days prior to air, when they created the idea of Cartman encountering a little person.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> They based the little person on an obscure old commercial featuring little people walking around in suits.<ref name=\"Parker\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=August 2008 |title=South Park: The Complete Eleventh Season: \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Reaction===\nThis episode received coverage by the [[CNN]] programs ''[[Showbiz Tonight]]'' and ''[[Paula Zahn Now]]''<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0703/08/pzn.01.html Transcript of \"Paula Zahn Now\" from March 8, 2007].

He mistakenly sets camp in the neighborhood of Bugs' rabbit hole, and Bugs (and a neighboring bear) don't have much leisure in mind. It was the first Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett|Robert Clampett]], with a story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by [[Carl Stalling]]. [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]] is the only credited animator, although [[Virgil Ross]], [[Rod Scribner]], and [[Robert McKimson]] also animated the short. [[Mel Blanc]] provided the voices for Bugs and the [[bear]], and [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] provided the voice for Elmer.\n\n==Plot==\nElmer, driving his [[Ford Model T]] [[jalopy]] to a [[Conga (music)|Conga]] beat, makes his way to Jellostone National Park (a pun on [[Yellowstone National Park]]) while looking forward to getting some rest. Elmer sets up his campsite by setting a camp fire, an hanging mirror on a tree and, beneath it, a wash basin on a table, hanging a hammock, and pitching his tent. The tent is positioned directly over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole (just as Elmer had arrived, Bugs had posted a sign next to his hole saying 'Camp Here', then had retreated into the lair, covering it with grass as he went). From down there, Bugs breaks down the tent and drags it inside. Elmer reaches in and, in spite of resistance from below, retrieves the tent which is tied in knots. Bugs pops up, welcomes Elmer to Jellostone (\"a restful retreat. Oh brudda!\") and pulls Elmer's hat over his eyes. Elmer reaches in again and tries to yank Bugs out. After several attempts, Elmer pulls his hands out to find that his fingers are tied together. He nails a board over the hole (\"that'll hold 'em alwhight, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\"). However, Bugs simply pushes it open, steps out and mimics Elmer. Bugs balloons up to Elmer's size and repeats what Elmer had said, labeling it \"phooey\". Elmer then settles into his hammock and quickly falls fast asleep, muttering to himself.\n\nBugs places a pair of glasses on Elmer's face, paints the lenses black and sets the alarm clock to go off at noon. When it wakes Elmer, he thinks it is nighttime because everything seems dark. He goes to his tent, takes off his day clothes to reveal night clothes underneath, and goes to bed. Bugs then removes the glasses from Elmer and crows like a rooster, awakening Elmer who believes it is the next morning.\n\nElmer washes his face but cannot reach his towel because it is hanging on a branch that Bugs keeps at a steady, short distance from him. Elmer blindly follows the towel (\"I do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture\", Bugs [[Breaking the fourth wall|confides to the audience]]). He causes Elmer to step off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the [[Grand Canyon]], but suddenly realizes he is in midair. He runs back to safety and holds on to Bugs for dear life. Bugs then admits he is the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.\n\nThe bear soon gives up (after sniffing Elmer's \"[[Body odor|B.O.]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 his feet), but Bugs climbs onto Elmer and starts growling exactly like the bear. He misbehaves in various ways to keep Elmer on the ground with his eyes shut, but just as he starts biting Elmer's foot, Elmer sees what is going on and grabs his shotgun. The bear returns and Bugs runs away just as Elmer swings the gun, clobbering the bear rather than the rabbit.  A chase ensues with Elmer and the bear running through the trees to the tune of the \"[[William Tell Overture]].\" Finally, the bear freaks Elmer out by riding on top of him.\n\nWhen the bear is knocked off him after hitting a tree branch, Elmer gives up and packs everything into his car (almost including a huge tree). He passes the welcome sign at the gate on his way out, backs up and reads it again. He declares its promise of \"a restful retreat\" to be \"bawogney!\" and, to teach the park not to give false advertisement, he chops the sign to bits with an ax and stomps on the pieces while calling the park's \"peace and wewaxation\" promises \"wubbish!\" A ranger (along with Bugs) appears, and has an angry expression on his face. Elmer is arrested for the destruction of government property, and from his jail cell window he tells us that \"anyway\" he is \"wid of that gwizzwy bear and scwewy wabbit! West and wewaxation at wast!\" Unfortunately, he turns to find out that somehow he is sharing his cell with both Bugs ''and'' the black bear. They both ask how long he has in jail (\"Pardon me but, how long ya in for, doc?\" they ask).\n\n==Production==\nFor the cartoon, Elmer was redesigned as a fat man (based on voice actor [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]'s own physique) in an attempt to make him funnier. The \"fat Elmer\" would only make three more appearances in the ''Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies'' canon&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Wabbit Who Came to Supper]]'', ''[[The Wacky Wabbit]]'' and ''[[Fresh Hare]]'', in addition to a [[cameo appearance]] in the non-canon war bond advertisement ''[[Any Bonds Today?]]''&nbsp;\u2013 before returning to the slimmer form by which he is better known, for ''[[The Hare-Brained Hypnotist]]''. This cartoon was the only time, though, that the Fat Elmer also had a red nose. This is the only cartoon with the \"fat\" version of Elmer to remain under copyright; the other \"fat Elmer\" cartoons are in the public domain.\n\nBugs would show up in a prison two more times: in ''[[Rebel Rabbit]]'' (1949) and ''[[Big House Bunny]]'' (1950). At the ends of ''[[Rabbit Transit (cartoon)|Rabbit Transit]]'' (1947) and ''[[Hare Brush]]'' (1955) he is arrested, but not actually shown in prison therein.\n\nThe lobby card where Bugs paints Elmer's glasses black is also done in the film.\n\n==Availability==\n* DVD - ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'', Volume 1\n* Blu-ray - ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection]]'', Volume 2\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Big Chungus.png|200px|thumb|The still frame from the short that has come to be known as \"Big Chungus\".]]\nIn December 2018, a still from the short depicting Bugs mocking Elmer by imitating his weight became an [[Internet meme]].
