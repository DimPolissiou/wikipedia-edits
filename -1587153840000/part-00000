[[n-Butyllithium]] undergoes a [[Organolithium reagent|halogen-lithium exchange]] reaction with the bromide at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to yield the intermediate '''c'''. The intermediate '''b''' is then added to a solution containing intermediate '''c''' dropwise. After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 [[anomer]]s was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]. The optically pure compound and intermediate '''a''' are reacted with trimethyl phosphate and methylimidazole to obtain a [[diastereomer]] mixture of remdesivir. In the end, optically pure remdesivir can be obtained through [[chiral resolution]] methods.\n\n==Access==\nOn 20 March 2020, President Trump announced that remdesivir was available for \"[[compassionate use]]\" by people with COVID-19; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn confirmed the statement at the same press conference.<!--Apologies, but the following definition does not capture the definition provided at the corresponding Wikipedia article on the subject, and so creates unnecessary contradiction.

The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the [[Bell YAH-63]] in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, [[McDonnell Douglas]] continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]], with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013.<ref name=Sterling_March_2013>{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Robert |title=Apache helicopters roar ahead |url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2013/06/bds_apache_06_03_13.page |website=Boeing.com |publisher=Boeing |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64. It has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has been built under license in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[AgustaWestland Apache]]. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. U.S. Congress approved $82M to begin the Apache B upgrade.

More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH-64C. The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast-mounted radar and newer \u2212700C engine versions.

It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for [[target acquisition]] and [[night vision device|night vision systems]]. It is armed with a [[30 mm caliber|{{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[M230 chain gun]] carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four [[hardpoint]]s mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missiles and [[Hydra 70]] rocket pods. The AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.\n\nThe Apache began as the ''Model 77'' developed by [[Hughes Helicopters]] for the [[United States Army]]'s [[Advanced Attack Helicopter]] program to replace the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobra]]. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the [[Bell YAH-63]] in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, [[McDonnell Douglas]] continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]], with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013.<ref name=Sterling_March_2013>{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Robert |title=Apache helicopters roar ahead |url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2013/06/bds_apache_06_03_13.page |website=Boeing.com |publisher=Boeing|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64. It has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has been built under license in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[AgustaWestland Apache]]. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Israel used the Apache in its military conflicts in [[Lebanon]] and the [[Gaza Strip]].

The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. U.S. Congress approved $82M to begin the Apache B upgrade.

More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH-64C. The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast-mounted radar and newer \u2212700C engine versions.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee.

Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Jack Epps</ref> Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker [[Saab automobile|Saab]] in the early 1980s, where a [[Saab 900]] turbo is shown racing a [[Saab 37 Viggen]] fighter jet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Matthew Modine]] turned down the role of [[Pete Mitchell (Top Gun)|LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell]] (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics.

During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|25000|1985|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985.

Another game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (1987 video game)|Top Gun]]'', was released in 1987 for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, ''Top Gun: The Second Mission'', was released for the NES three years later.\n\nAnother game, ''[[Top Gun: Fire at Will]]'', was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the [[PlayStation|Sony PlayStation]] platform. ''[[Top Gun: Hornet's Nest]]'' was released in 1998. ''[[Top Gun: Combat Zones]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001 and was subsequently released for the [[GameCube]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Combat Zones'' features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled ''Top Gun'' was released for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A 2010 game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (2010 video game)|Top Gun]]'', retells the film's story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, ''Top Gun: Hard Lock'', which was released in March 2012 for [[Xbox 360]], PC, and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Top Gun (film, 1986)}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|id=57496}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092099}}\n* {{tcmdb title|16475}}\n* [http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/top-gun-30th-anniversary-remember-the-movie-with-this-exclusive-artwork-750546 'Top Gun' 30th Anniversary Exclusive Art Work] on [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]]\n* {{Allmovie title|50435}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|top_gun}}\n* [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=topgun.htm Top Gun] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n* [https://www.paramountmovies.com/movies/top-gun Paramount Movies]\n{{Tony Scott}}\n{{Jerry Bruckheimer}}\n\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 3D films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American action drama films]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Cold War aviation films]]\n[[Category:Films about aviators]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Simpson]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tony Scott]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Diego]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Diego]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Top Gun]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Harold Faltermeyer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Giorgio Moroder]]\n[[Category:3D re-releases]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the film}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Top Gun\n| image          = Top Gun Movie.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Tony Scott]]\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Don Simpson]]\n* [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n}}\n| writer         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Jim Cash]]\n* [[Jack Epps Jr.]]\n}}\n| based on       = {{based on|''\"Top Guns\"''|Ehud Yonay}}\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Tom Cruise]]\n* [[Kelly McGillis]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]]\n* [[Anthony Edwards]]\n* [[Tom Skerritt]]}}<!--NAMES ON POSTER ONLY-->\n| music          = [[Harold Faltermeyer]]\n| cinematography = [[Jeffrey L.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985.

The [[Top Gun (1986 video game)|original game]] was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari ST]]. Another game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (1987 video game)|Top Gun]]'', was released in 1987 for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, ''Top Gun: The Second Mission'', was released for the NES three years later.\n\nAnother game, ''[[Top Gun: Fire at Will]]'', was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the [[PlayStation|Sony PlayStation]] platform. ''[[Top Gun: Hornet's Nest]]'' was released in 1998. ''[[Top Gun: Combat Zones]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001 and was subsequently released for the [[GameCube]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Combat Zones'' features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled ''Top Gun'' was released for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A 2010 game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (2010 video game)|Top Gun]]'', retells the film's story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, ''Top Gun: Hard Lock'', which was released in March 2012 for [[Xbox 360]], PC, and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Top Gun (film, 1986)}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|id=57496}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092099}}\n* {{tcmdb title|16475}}\n* [http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/top-gun-30th-anniversary-remember-the-movie-with-this-exclusive-artwork-750546 'Top Gun' 30th Anniversary Exclusive Art Work] on [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]]\n* {{Allmovie title|50435}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|top_gun}}\n* [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=topgun.htm Top Gun] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n* [https://www.paramountmovies.com/movies/top-gun Paramount Movies]\n{{Tony Scott}}\n{{Jerry Bruckheimer}}\n\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 3D films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American action drama films]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Cold War aviation films]]\n[[Category:Films about aviators]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Simpson]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tony Scott]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Diego]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Diego]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Top Gun]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Harold Faltermeyer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Giorgio Moroder]]\n[[Category:3D re-releases]]\n", "name_user": "Mandingo30", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun"}

It is one of a group of cases, known as the \"[[coronation cases]]\", which arose from events surrounding the [[coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]] in 1902.\n\n==Facts==\nThe defendant, CS Henry, agreed by contract on 20 June 1902, to rent a [[apartment|flat]] at 56A [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] from the plaintiff, Paul Krell, for the purpose of watching the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation procession]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]  scheduled for 26 and 27 June. The [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] of the premises had informed Henry that he would have an excellent view of the procession from the room.\n\nDesiring to secure the rental of Krell's flat for the purpose of observing the coronation procession, Henry wrote the following letter to Krell's solicitor:\n\n<blockquote>I am in receipt of yours of the 18th instant, inclosing form of agreement for the suite of chambers on the third floor at 56A, [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], which I have agreed to take for the two days, the 26th and 27th instant, for the sum of 75l. For reasons given you I cannot enter into the agreement, but as arranged over the telephone I inclose herewith cheque for 25l. as deposit, and will thank you to confirm to me that I shall have the entire use of these rooms during the days (not the  nights) of the 26th and 27th instant. You may rely that every care will be taken of the premises and their contents. On the 24th inst. I will pay the balance, viz., 50l., to complete the 75l. agreed upon.</blockquote>\n\nThe defendant received the following reply from the plaintiff's solicitor:\n\n<blockquote>I am in receipt of your letter of to-day's date inclosing cheque for 25l. deposit on your agreeing to take Mr. Krell's chambers on the third floor at 56A, Pall Mall for the two days,\nthe 26th and 27th June, and I confirm the agreement that you are to have the entire use of these rooms during the days (but not the nights), the balance, 50l., to be paid to me on Tuesday next the 24th instant.</blockquote>\n\nThe parties agreed on a price of \u00a375, but nowhere in their written correspondence mentioned the coronation ceremony explicitly. Henry paid a deposit of \u00a325 to Krell for the use of the flat, but when the procession did not take place on the days originally set, on the grounds of the King\u2019s illness, Henry refused to pay the remaining \u00a350. Krell brought [[lawsuit|suit]] against Henry to recover the remaining balance of \u00a350, and Henry [[counterclaim|countersued]] to recover his deposit in the amount of \u00a325.\n\n==Judgment==\nDarling LJ held in the initial case that there was an implied condition in the contract, using ''[[Taylor v. Caldwell]]'' and ''[[The Moorcock]]'', and gave judgment for the defendant on both the claim and the counterclaim.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's appeal. Lord Justice Vaughan Williams framed the legal question in this case as whether there was an implied condition to the contract: whether or not while the contract was made, the two parties knew that the reason behind the contract was for Henry to watch the coronation procession.\n\nThe principle that an implied condition that ceases to exist voids the contract stems from the case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'', which, in turn, was borrowed from [[Roman law]]. The principle was extended, in later cases, to situations in which an underlying condition that was essential to the performance of the contract, rather than simply being a [[necessary condition]], ceases to exist.\n\nVaughan Williams LJ held that such a condition (here, the timely occurrence of the coronation proceeding) need not be explicitly mentioned in the contract itself but rather may be inferred from the extrinsic circumstances surrounding the contract. Thus, the [[parol evidence rule]] was inapplicable here.\n\nFirstly, he examined the substance of the contract, and then determined whether the contract was founded on the assumption of the existence of a particular state of affairs.\n\nHe then determined that given the [[affidavits]] of the parties, Krell had granted Henry a licence to use the rooms for a particular purpose: watching the coronation. He analogized the situation to one in which a man hired a [[taxicab]] to take him to a race. If the race did not occur on the particular day the passenger had thought, he would not be discharged from paying the driver. However, unlike the situation in the case, the cab did not have any special qualification, as the room did, its view of the street. Furthermore, the cancellation of the coronation could not reasonably have been anticipated by the parties at the time the contract was made.\n\n[[Mark Romer, Baron Romer|Romer LJ]] said,\n\n{{quote|With some doubt I have also come to the conclusion that this case is governed by the principle on which ''Taylor v Caldwell''<ref>3 B&S 826</ref> was decided, and accordingly that the appeal must be dismissed. The doubt I have felt was whether the parties to the contract now before us could be said, under the circumstances, not to have had at all in their contemplation the risk that for some reason or other the coronation processions might not take place on the days fixed, or, if the processions took place, might not pass so as to be capable of being viewed from the rooms mentioned in the contract; and whether, under this contract, that risk was not undertaken by the defendant. But on the question of fact as to what was in the contemplation of the parties at the time, I do not think it right to differ from the conclusion arrived at by Vaughan Williams L.J., and (as I gather) also arrived at by my brother Stirling. This being so, I concur in the conclusions arrived at by Vaughan Williams L.J. in his judgment, and I do not desire to add anything to what he has said so fully and completely.}}\n\nStirling LJ concurred.\n\n==See also==\n{{Clist impossibility}}\n*''[[The Moorcock]]''\n*''[[Herne Bay Steamboat Co v Hutton]]''\n*''[[Chandler v Webster]]''\n* [[Frustration in English law]]\n* [[King Edward VII of the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203064942/http://www3.uninsubria.it/uninsubria/allegati/pagine/1438/priv_comp2.pdf Link to full text of case] In PDF format\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090604174735/http://www.lawnix.com/cases/krell-henry.html Link to a summary of the case]\n\n[[Category:Court of Appeal of England and Wales cases]]\n[[Category:1903 in case law]]\n[[Category:English frustration case law]]\n[[Category:English contract case law]]\n[[Category:1903 in British law]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2015}}\n{{Infobox court case\n| name = Krell v Henry\n| court = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]\n| image = London Reform Club.jpg\n| date decided = \n| full name = Paul Krell v CS Henry\n| citations = [1903] 2 KB 740\n| judges = [[Roland Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams LJ]], [[Mark Romer, Baron Romer|Romer LJ]] and [[James Stirling (judge)|Stirling LJ]]\n| prior actions = Appeal from [[Charles Darling, 1st Baron Darling|Darling J]]\n| subsequent actions = \n| opinions = \n| transcripts =\n| keywords = [[Frustration of purpose|Frustration]]\n}}\n\n'''''Krell v Henry''''' [1903] 2 KB 740 is an  [[England|English]]  case which sets forth the doctrine of  [[frustration of purpose]]  in [[contract law]].
