The value will depend heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF energy, and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. Thus tests must be made with each specific source, such as a mobile phone model, and at the intended position of use.\n\n=== Mobile phone SAR testing ===\n{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}\nWhen measuring the SAR due to a mobile phone the phone is placed against a representation of a human head (a \"SAR Phantom\") in a talk position. The SAR value is then measured at the location that has the highest absorption rate in the entire head, which in the case of a mobile phone is often as close to the phone's antenna as possible. Measurements are made for different positions on both sides of the head and at different frequencies representing the frequency bands at which the device can transmit. Depending on the size and capabilities of the phone, additional testing may also be required to represent usage of the device while placed close to the user's body and/or extremities. Various governments have defined maximum SAR levels for RF energy emitted by mobile devices:\n\n*[[United States]]: the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6&nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1&nbsp;gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal.\n*[[European Union]]: [[CENELEC]] specify SAR limits within the EU, following [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2&nbsp;W/kg averaged over the 10&nbsp;g of tissue absorbing the most signal ([http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/033746 IEC 62209-1]).\n*[[India]]: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers. All handsets must have a hands free mode.<ref name=IAreg>{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=87152 |title=Stringent Mobile Radiation Standards Come into Force from tomorrow New Mobile Handsets to comply with SAR Value of 1.6W/KG - Penalty, Random Checks Introduced for Enforcement |publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]], Government of India |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref>\n\nSAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.\nTo check SAR on your mobile phone, review the documentation provided with the phone, dial *#07# (only works on some models) or visit the manufacturer's website.\n\n=== MRI scanner SAR testing ===\nFor Magnetic Resonance Imaging the limits (described in [http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/043851?opendocument IEC 60601-2-33]) are slightly more complicated:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| \n!

Such studies can possibly shed light on thresholds of non-ionizing radiation effects and cell capabilities (e.g., oxidative response).

The value will depend heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF energy, and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. Thus tests must be made with each specific source, such as a mobile phone model, and at the intended position of use.\n\n=== Mobile phone SAR testing ===\n{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}\nWhen measuring the SAR due to a mobile phone the phone is placed against a representation of a human head (a \"SAR Phantom\") in a talk position. The SAR value is then measured at the location that has the highest absorption rate in the entire head, which in the case of a mobile phone is often as close to the phone's antenna as possible. Measurements are made for different positions on both sides of the head and at different frequencies representing the frequency bands at which the device can transmit. Depending on the size and capabilities of the phone, additional testing may also be required to represent usage of the device while placed close to the user's body and/or extremities. Various governments have defined maximum SAR levels for RF energy emitted by mobile devices:\n\n*[[United States]]: the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6&nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1&nbsp;gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal.\n*[[European Union]]: [[CENELEC]] specify SAR limits within the EU, following [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2&nbsp;W/kg averaged over the 10&nbsp;g of tissue absorbing the most signal ([http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/033746 IEC 62209-1]).\n*[[India]]: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers. All handsets must have a hands free mode.<ref name=IAreg>{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=87152 |title=Stringent Mobile Radiation Standards Come into Force from tomorrow New Mobile Handsets to comply with SAR Value of 1.6W/KG - Penalty, Random Checks Introduced for Enforcement |publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]], Government of India |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref>\n\nSAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.\nTo check SAR on your mobile phone, review the documentation provided with the phone, dial *#07# (only works on some models) or visit the manufacturer's website.\n\n=== MRI scanner SAR testing ===\nFor Magnetic Resonance Imaging the limits (described in [http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/043851?opendocument IEC 60601-2-33]) are slightly more complicated:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| \n!
