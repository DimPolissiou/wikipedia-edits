In 1967 he migrated to New Zealand to study law at the [[University of Auckland]] where he realised his [[LLB]] degree and undertook the Law Professional exams in 1972. He practised as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand for over 21 years and is remembered for \u201cintroducing the ''mens rea'' ingredient to the offence of overstaying\u201d.<ref>Arif Rasheed, \u201cRemembering a great humanitarian \u2013 Abdul Rahim Rasheed QSO\u201d, NZ Lawyer, 15 December 2006, page 4.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1969 Rasheed and several Auckland based Indian Muslims from Fiji set up the Anjuman Himayat Al-Islami. Rasheed afforded the organisation both secular leadership and legal advice. Following negotiations with other Muslims in [[Auckland]] Muslim community it was agreed to formally dissolve the Anjuman and merge it into the older New Zealand Muslim Association (NZMA). In January 1977, Rasheed was appointed both president and legal advisor of the NZMA, whilst Avdo Musovich served as vice-president. Hafiz Sidat and Maulana [[Ahmed Said Musa Patel]] served as the spiritual and religious advisors to the organisation. On 6 March 1977 the NZMA held its AGM in the 17 Vermont Street Islamic Centre in [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]] and Rasheed was confirmed as Association president. He subsequently held the job for ten years. In February 1987 Rasheed stood down from the post but was directly selected to be the Association Patron. He maintained this title until 1990.\n\nIn November 1979, the [[Auckland City Council]] sanctioned plans for the first purpose built mosque in all New Zealand. Rasheed, Said Alvi, Patel, [[Mazhar Krasniqi]] and Hajji Mohammed Hussein Sahib all mortgaged their private homes in order to ensure the Association had enough money to follow the project through.\n\nElsewhere Muslims throughout New Zealand had initiated dialogue on the urgent necessity of creating a nationwide Islamic entity to represent all their collective communal aims, interests and objectives. In April 1979 the [[Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand]] (FIANZ) was established with Rasheed\u2019s friend and colleague from the NZMA, [[Mazhar Krasniqi]], as the first president. Six months later in September 1979 Rasheed was voted president. Rasheed maintained this title until the FIANZ AGM of 6 April 1980, and was re-elected in April 1981 for two consecutive years. Under Rasheed the Federation devoted itself to the welfare of all Muslims, to efforts to educate the wider public about Islam as a faith and to the certification of Halal export meat. In May 1984 Rasheed was part of a ten-man delegation  - alongside Dr [[Ashraf Choudhary]], [[Mazhar Krasniqi]], members of the New Zealand Meat Board and a representative of the Department of Trade and industry - to the UAE and Kuwait to resolve ongoing Halal issues. So FIANZ secured its first contract with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board in 1984 for $169,000. Today this contract generates annual income of over one million dollars.<ref>FIANZ Annual Report 2012 (Wellington \u2013 2012).</ref>  In January 1985 when the Federation sent a four-man delegation to attend the RISEAP AGM in [[Malaysia]], Rasheed was selected to participate.\n\nRasheed featured regularly in the New Zealand media and was one of the first Muslims to respond and interact proactively. In December 1980 he was first interviewed by New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, on the Auckland regional programme \u201cTop Half\u201d talking about the ongoing construction of the mosque in Ponsonby.<ref>Top Half, \u201cMosque\u201d, 15 December 1980, New Zealand Television Archives.</ref>  He was also interviewed three years later on television in June 1983 for an item on Ramadan in New Zealand.<ref>Nationwide, \u201cRamadan\u201d, 15 June 1983, New Zealand Television Archives.</ref>  Overall Rasheed featured prominently in various newspaper articles on Islam.<ref>Peter Trickett, \u201cMinarets in Ponsonby\u201d, NZ Listener (21 April 1979), pp 18-19.; Anne Elder, \u201cMuslim locals strengthen faith\u201d, Star Weekender (24 July 1982), page 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1992 Rasheed retired from many of this tasks owing to ill health, as well as from NZMA and FIANZ activities. He continued, hover, to participate in more modest community affairs and even furthered his own education. Rasheed had strong feelings about improving Christian-Muslim relationships for instance and was a founder (and later the patron) of the Auckland-based Council of Christians and Muslims (CCM). During this time he studied with Dr Douglas Pratt at the prestigious University of Waikato and in 1996 became a Bachelor of Theology (University of Auckland). Rasheed was interviewed by the New Zealand Herald for the occasion and articulated his belief that it was critical for Christians and Muslims to respect one another\u2019s dogmas.<ref>Sue Norton, \u201cMuslim devotes life to inter-faith understanding\u201d, The New Zealand Herald (11 May 1996), page 20.</ref>  When Dr Pratt published his prominent book \u201cThe Challenge of Islam: Encounters in Interfaith Dialogue\u201d in 2005, he honoured Rasheed by dedicating the monograph to his former student.\n\nThe Federation of Islamic Associations hosted a WAMY-sponsored South Pacific Islamic Youth Da\u2019wah Training Course at [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]] Mosque in April 1999. This week-long gathering was organised by Rasheed and drew in over a hundred Muslim youth representing most of the South Pacific region. The Deputy Mayor of Auckland, the Reverend Dr [[Bruce Huckner]], was the chief guest. Other interlocutors included Dr Hajji Mustapha Omari (from the Australian WAMY office) and Dr Pratt.\n\nRasheed was appointed a Companion of the Queen\u2019s Service Order (QSO) for his decades of community service in June 2002.<ref>New Zealand Gazette (5 June 2002), Issue Number 57, page number 1533.</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 3 October 2006 Abdul Rahim Rasheed died in Auckland.<ref>RASHEED, The New Zealand Herald (4 October 2006), page D7.</ref>  A Commemorative Dinner was undertaken at the Auckland Chancery Chambers on 1 December and this was attended by the Governor-General, several prominent government ministers (past and present), and many lawyers, judges, doctors, academics and other friends. A resolution was made to continue Rasheed\u2019s work in the creation of the Rasheed Memorial Da\u2019wah Trust.\n\n[[Waikato University]] academic Douglas Pratt, who lectured Rasheed at Auckland University and described him as \"both my student and my teacher\", said he was a voice for tolerance at a time when more strident voices hogged the headlines. \"His whole philosophy as a Muslim leader was to say, 'Here in this country are many religions and it behoves us to (a) be good citizens, and (b) lead our religious lives in such a way that we can be good neighbours and live in dialogue.' \"To that extent he was a unique voice,\" Pratt said.<ref>Simon Collins, \u201cLawyer's voice for tolerance lives on\u201d, The New Zealand Herald (19 March 2007), page A8.</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\n*Anne Elder, \u201cMuslim locals strengthen faith\u201d, Star Weekender, 24 July 1982, p.&nbsp;10.\n*Arif Rasheed, \u201cRemembering a great humanitarian \u2013 Abdul Rahim Rasheed QSO\u201d, NZ Lawyer, 15 December 2006, page 4.\n*Sue Norton, \u201cMuslim devotes life to inter-faith understanding\u201d, The New Zealand Herald, 11 May 1996, p.&nbsp;20 .\n*Simon Collins, \u201cLawyer's voice for tolerance lives on\u201d, The New Zealand Herald, 19 March 2007, p.

In an effort to settle the dispute regarding who was the world's fastest man, a race not sanctioned by [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] was held at [[SkyDome]] between [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 metre]] champion [[Donovan Bailey]] from [[Canada]], and 1996 Olympic [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 metres|200 metre]] and [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres|400 metre]] champion [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]], from the United States.\n\n==Background==\nThe unofficial title of \"world's fastest man\" typically goes to the Olympic 100 metre champion. The Olympics 100\u2013200 metre double had been achieved only four times before 1996: at [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] and [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]] for men and Munich and [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul]] for the women.\n\nIn 1996, the host of [[NBC]]'s [[Olympics on NBC|Olympics coverage]] [[Bob Costas]], and others,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersweb.com/running/fastest.html |title=Fastest Man & Woman Calculator |publisher=Runnersweb.com |date=1999-06-18 |accessdate=2012-04-11}}</ref> pointed out that Johnson's gold-medal performance in the 200 m (19.32 seconds) was faster than Bailey's 100 m performance (9.84 seconds) in that 19.32 divided by two is 9.66.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/whos-the-worlds-fastest-runner/ |title=Who's the World's Fastest Runner? |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2012-04-11}}</ref> Bailey later dismissed Costas' comments as \"a person who knew nothing about track talking about it with a lot of people listening\"; nonetheless, the sportscaster's remarks touched a nerve.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010202/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Pulling A Fast One | date=9 June 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe 200 metre time almost always yields a \"faster\" average speed than a 100-metre race time, since the initial slow speed at the start is spread out over the longer distance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2008/06/fastest-man-in-world.html |title=Who is the fastest man in the world? |publisher=Sportsscientists.com |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2012-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523165116/http://www.sportsscientists.com/2008/06/fastest-man-in-world.html |archive-date=2012-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In other words, the second 100 metres is run with a \"flying start\", without the slow acceleration phase of the first 100 metres and without the greater than 0.10 s reaction time of the start.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010202/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Pulling A Fast One | date=9 June 1997}}</ref> In fact, each 200 metre gold medalist from 1968, when fully electronic timing was introduced, to 1996 had a \"faster\" average speed at the Olympics, save one, yet there had been no controversy over the title of \"world's fastest man\" previously, until Bob Costas' remarks during the 1996 Olympics.\n\nNotably in the 1996 edition of the men's 100 metre final, after golds in [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|1984]] and [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|1988]], as well as a bronze in [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|1992]], the Americans had finished out of the medals despite being the hosts. Adding insult to injury, the Canadian team anchored by Bailey also defeated the Americans in the [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|4 x 100 metre relay]]. Bailey's accomplishments in the 1996 Summer Olympics, both firsts for Canadians, provided considerable national pride.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/18666039.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+12%2C+1996&author=By+T.+Sher+Singh&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.13&desc=Bailey+brought+us+together Bailey brought us together];''Toronto Star'', 12 August 1996</ref>\n\nSome Canadians saw the American media's promotion of Michael Johnson as the \"world's fastest man\" as a cynical attempt to lessen Bailey's achievements.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/18667208.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+13%2C+1996&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.12&desc=NBC%27s+math+puts+Bailey+faster+than+self NBC's math puts Bailey faster than self];''Toronto Star'', 13 August 1996</ref> It was also seen as reminiscent of the [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]-[[Carl Lewis]] rivalry in the 1980s, a rivalry that was exacerbated at the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics|1987 World Championships]] in Rome after Ben Johnson defeated Lewis in the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 metre]] final. In defeat, Lewis begun voicing accusations that Ben Johnson was using performance-enhancing drugs, behavior which was seen as egotistical and lacking humility, despite the accusations later being proven to be true the following year.

As late as few days before the race, promotional and financial problems threatened to cancel the event. Clearly in over their heads Khoja and Briden turned to experienced Toronto deal-maker Edwin \"Eddy\" Cogan. A financial restructuring was required to ensure payment to Johnson and Bailey, and a bailout of more than $1 million by Cogan was necessary to pay outstanding bills.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/02/sports/in-a-duel-of-the-fastest-bailey-runs-all-alone.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm In a Duel of the Fastest, Bailey Runs All Alone];''The New York Times'', 2 June 1997</ref> In essence, in the eleventh hour, Khoja and Briden surrendered the race over to Cogan and his associate Dennis Jewitt who was put in charge of restructuring the event's finances.\n\nOn Friday, two days before the race, Bailey examined the track in SkyDome and revealed his shock at its configuration, specifically the tight radius of the turn. The next day he trained at the track and reportedly asked the event organizers to move the finish line 11.8 meters down the track, but got refused for logistical reasons. Bailey complained that the turn was supposed to emulate the wider curve of the outer lanes 7 and 8 on a standard eight-lane track, not the tighter turns of the middle lanes 3 and 4. Bailey also claimed that the first 85 meters of the track were on the curve instead of 75 meters as promised. Nevertheless, he decided to run, but not before putting out a press release early on Sunday before the race, blasting the organizers for \"deceitfulness\", \"egregious miscarriage of the competitive spirit of this competition\" while adding that as a result he would be running the race \"under mental duress\". The runners were positioned with Bailey running in the track's 3rd lane with Johnson in the next outer lane (4th lane).\n\n===The race===\nSome 30,000 spectators showed up at the SkyDome for the main event that featured five-event [[undercard]] including a performance by the [[Blues Brothers]]. The race was billed as a competition for the title of \"World's Fastest Man\", but it failed to live up to expectations. Bailey was brilliant as he was ahead of Johnson on the curved portion, where it had been assumed that Johnson would have had the advantage. Johnson (losing the race at the time) pulled up at the 110-metre mark having injured his [[Quadriceps muscle|quadriceps]], appearing to grab his quadriceps and then slowed to a stop before squatting on the track in distress.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010202/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Pulling A Fast One | date=9 June 1997}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the race, Bailey looked back at Johnson and waved for him to \"come on\", believing he had simply quit the race. Immediately upon winning the race while mobbed by reporters, pumped and animated Bailey shot the following into the CBC camera: {{cquote|There was never any doubt in my mind that I was the fastest man on the planet and this just proved it. They said I couldn't run a corner, but I always said this is exposing Michael Johnson and the weaknesses in his race.

Asked to comment on claims that are now sure to follow about this clearly proving that Bailey is the world's fastest man, Johnson responded: \"Even if I had won it, and I feel very confident that I could have, some people would've said that.

He knew he was going to get hammered after the first 30 meters, so he knew he had to pull up.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010202/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Pulling A Fast One | date=9 June 1997}}</ref> This race was never going to prove who was the fastest in the world.

I'm going to show you what kind of person I am. I'm not going to address that\". Another question alluded to Johnson \"packing it in\" when he fell behind and one more wondered if Johnson had been \"genuinely injured\" or if he had simply \"thrown the race\", to which irritated Johnson responded by shooting back, \"I hope you're very proud of yourself. And I hope you're very proud of Donovan. You should be.\"\n\nBailey finished with a time of 14.99 seconds and walked away with the $1.5 million prize, while Johnson received $500,000.\n\nIn addition to Canada and the U.S., the race was broadcast in 54 other countries.

As late as few days before the race, promotional and financial problems threatened to cancel the event. Clearly in over their heads Khoja and Briden turned to experienced Toronto deal-maker Edwin \"Eddy\" Cogan. A financial restructuring was required to ensure payment to Johnson and Bailey, and a bailout of more than $1 million by Cogan was necessary to pay outstanding bills.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/02/sports/in-a-duel-of-the-fastest-bailey-runs-all-alone.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm In a Duel of the Fastest, Bailey Runs All Alone];''The New York Times'', 2 June 1997</ref> In essence, in the eleventh hour, Khoja and Briden surrendered the race over to Cogan and his associate Dennis Jewitt who was put in charge of restructuring the event's finances.\n\nOn Friday, two days before the race, Bailey examined the track in SkyDome and revealed his shock at its configuration, specifically the tight radius of the turn. The next day he trained at the track and reportedly asked the event organizers to move the finish line 11.8 meters down the track, but got refused for logistical reasons. Bailey complained that the turn was supposed to emulate the wider curve of the outer lanes 7 and 8 on a standard eight-lane track, not the tighter turns of the middle lanes 3 and 4. Bailey also claimed that the first 85 meters of the track were on the curve instead of 75 meters as promised. Nevertheless, he decided to run, but not before putting out a press release early on Sunday before the race, blasting the organizers for \"deceitfulness\", \"egregious miscarriage of the competitive spirit of this competition\" while adding that as a result he would be running the race \"under mental duress\". The runners were positioned with Bailey running in the track's 3rd lane with Johnson in the next outer lane (4th lane).\n\n===The race===\nSome 30,000 spectators showed up at the SkyDome for the main event that featured five-event [[undercard]] including a performance by the [[Blues Brothers]]. The race was billed as a competition for the title of \"World's Fastest Man\", but it failed to live up to expectations. Bailey was brilliant as he was ahead of Johnson on the curved portion, where it had been assumed that Johnson would have had the advantage. Johnson (losing the race at the time) pulled up at the 110-metre mark having injured his [[Quadriceps muscle|quadriceps]], appearing to grab his quadriceps and then slowed to a stop before squatting on the track in distress.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010202/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Pulling A Fast One | date=9 June 1997}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the race, Bailey looked back at Johnson and waved for him to \"come on\", believing he had simply quit the race. Immediately upon winning the race while mobbed by reporters, pumped and animated Bailey shot the following into the CBC camera: {{cquote|There was never any doubt in my mind that I was the fastest man on the planet and this just proved it. They said I couldn't run a corner, but I always said this is exposing Michael Johnson and the weaknesses in his race. This is just preparation, we're gonna run a couple of twos (200 metres) this year and I plan on meeting him in his event. He didn't pull up\u2014he's a chicken. He didn't pull up at all\u2014he's just a chicken. He's afraid to lose. I think what he should do, we should run this race over again, so I can kick his ass one more time.

Asked to comment on claims that are now sure to follow about this clearly proving that Bailey is the world's fastest man, Johnson responded: \"Even if I had won it, and I feel very confident that I could have, some people would've said that. Everyone is always entitled to their opinion and, you know, I can't do anything about that\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id8v-yTK5Do Donovan Bailey vs. Michael Johnson];CBS, 1 June 1997</ref>\n\nAt a press conference right after, Bailey continued the aggressive manner of his post-race interview: \"It's obvious that the gap was going to get bigger and my butt was going to get smaller and smaller as I pulled away from him. He knew he was going to get hammered after the first 30 meters, so he knew he had to pull up.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010202/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Pulling A Fast One | date=9 June 1997}}</ref> This race was never going to prove who was the fastest in the world.

I'm going to show you what kind of person I am. I'm not going to address that\". Another question alluded to Johnson \"packing it in\" when he fell behind and one more wondered if Johnson had been \"genuinely injured\" or if he had simply \"thrown the race\", to which irritated Johnson responded by shooting back, \"I hope you're very proud of yourself. And I hope you're very proud of Donovan. You should be.\"\n\nBailey finished with a time of 14.99 seconds and walked away with the $1.5 million prize, while Johnson received $500,000.\n\nIn addition to Canada and the U.S., the race was broadcast in 54 other countries. Several days after the event, CBC released the ratings for its 90-minute coverage of the race, showing stellar viewership rates in Canada with 2.584 million people watching the entire broadcast that included some of the undercard events.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/508555611.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+5%2C+1997&author=&pub=The+Spectator&edition=&startpage=D.1.FRO&desc=Bailey-Johnson+race+a+front-runner+in+ratings Bailey-Johnson race a front-runner in ratings];''The Hamilton Spectator'', 5 June 1997</ref>\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

A member of the [[Illinois]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] he was the first [[African American]] to be elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in the 20th century.  During his three terms, he was the only African American serving in Congress.  He served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Illinois' 1st congressional district]] from 1929 to 1935.  De Priest was also the first African-American U.S. Representative from outside the [[Southern United States|southern states]], the first since the [[Reconstruction Era]], and the first since the exit of North Carolina representative [[George Henry White]] from Congress in 1901. \n  \nBorn in Alabama to [[freedmen]] parents, De Priest was raised in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He studied business and made a fortune in Chicago as a contractor, and in real estate and the stock market before the Crash. A successful local politician, he was elected to the [[Chicago City Council]] in 1914, the first African American to hold that office. \n\nIn Congress in the early 1930s, he spoke out against racial discrimination, including at speaking events in the South; tried to integrate the House public restaurant; gained passage of an amendment to [[racial segregation|desegregate]] the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], one of the work programs under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]; and introduced anti-[[lynching]] legislation to the House (it was not passed because of the [[Solid South]] Democratic opposition).  In 1934, De Priest was defeated by [[Arthur W. Mitchell]], the first African American to be elected as a Democrat to Congress.  De Priest returned to Chicago and his successful business ventures, eventually returning to politics, when he was again elected [[Chicago City Council|Chicago alderman]] in the 1940s.\n\n==Early life==\nDe Priest was born in 1871 in [[Florence, Alabama]], to [[freedmen]], former slaves of mixed race. He had a brother named Robert. His mother, Martha Karsner, worked part-time as a laundress, and his father Neander was a [[teamster]], associated with the \"Exodus\" movement. After the Civil War, thousands of blacks left continued oppression by whites in the South by moving to other states that offered promises of freedom and greater economic opportunities, such as Kansas. Others moved later in the century.<ref name=\"stokes\"/>\n\nIn 1878, the year after Reconstruction had ended and federal troops been withdrawn from the region, the De Priests left Alabama for Dayton, Ohio. Violence had increased in Alabama as whites had tried to restore white supremacy: the elder De Priest had to save his friend, former U.S. Representative [[James T. Rapier]], from a [[lynching|lynch mob]], and a black man was killed on their doorstep.<ref name=\"stokes\">{{cite web|last1=Stokes-Hammond|first1=Shelley|title=Pathbreakers: Oscar Stanton DePriest and Jessie L.

He worked first as an apprentice plasterer, house painter, and decorator. He became a successful contractor and real estate broker. He built a fortune in the stock market and in real estate by helping black families move into formerly all-white neighborhoods, often ones formerly occupied by ethnic white immigrants and their descendants. There was population succession in many neighborhoods under the pressure of new migrants.\n\n===Politics===\nFrom 1904 to 1908, De Priest was a member of the board of commissioners of [[Cook County, Illinois]].<ref name=baic/>\n\nDe Priest was elected in 1914 to the [[Chicago City Council]], serving from 1915 to 1917 as alderman from the 2nd Ward, on the South Side. He was Chicago's first black alderman. In 1917 De Priest was indicted for alleged [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and resigned from the City Council.

In a few years, De Priest's black political organization became the most powerful of many in Chicago, and he became the top black politician under Chicago [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor [[William Hale Thompson]].\n[[File:OscarDePriest.PNG|thumb|right|200px|De Priest in May 1922<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Julius F.|title=The Broad Ax|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=TBA19220513&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------#|accessdate=17 June 2015|issue=34|date=1922-05-13}}</ref>]]\nIn 1928, when Republican congressman [[Martin B. Madden]] died, Mayor Thompson selected De Priest to replace him on the ballot. He was the first African American elected to Congress outside the South and the first to be elected in the 20th century. He represented the [[Illinois' 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District of Illinois]] (which included [[Chicago Loop|The Loop]] and part of the [[South Side of Chicago]]) as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].<ref name=baic/> During the 1930 election, De Priest was challenged in the primary by noted African-American spokesperson, orator, and Republican [[Roscoe Simmons|Roscoe Conkling Simmons]]. De Priest defeated Simmon's primary challenge and won the general election afterward.<ref>''The Union'' (Chicago, IL) March 6, 1930.</ref> During De Priest's three consecutive terms (1929\u20131935), he was the only black representative in Congress. He introduced several anti-discrimination bills during these years of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nDePriest's 1933 amendment barring discrimination in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), a program of the New Deal to employ people across the country in building infrastructure, was passed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. His anti-[[lynching]] bill failed due to opposition by the white conservative Democrats of the [[Solid South]], although it would not have made lynching a federal crime. (Previous anti-lynching bills had also failed to pass the Senate, which was dominated by the South since its disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century.) A third proposal, a bill to permit a transfer of jurisdiction if a defendant believed he or she could not get a fair trial because of race or religion, was passed by a later Congress.\n\n[[Civil rights]] activists criticized De Priest for opposing federal aid to the poor. Nevertheless, they applauded him for making public speeches in the [[Southern United States|South]] despite death threats. They also praised De Priest for telling an [[Alabama]] senator he was not big enough to prevent him from dining in the private Senate restaurant. (Some Congressmen ate in the Senate restaurant to avoid De Priest, who usually ate in the Members Dining Room designated for Congressmen.) The public areas of the House and Senate restaurants were segregated. The House accepted that De Priest sometimes brought black staff or visitors to the Members Dining Room, but objected when he entertained mixed groups there.<ref name=\"restaurant\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2293932 Elliott M.

He took this issue of discrimination against the students (and other black visitors) to a special bipartisan House committee. In a three-month-long heated debate, the Republican political minority argued that the restaurant's discriminatory practice violated [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights to equal access. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] majority skirted the issue by claiming that the restaurant was a private facility and not open to the public. The House restaurant remained [[racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] through much of the 1940s and maybe as late as 1952.<ref name=\"restaurant\"/>\n\nIn 1929, De Priest made national news when [[First Lady]] [[Lou Hoover]] invited his wife, [[Jessie De Priest]], to [[Jessie De Priest tea at the White House|a traditional tea for congressional wives at the White House]].<ref name=\"racialtea\">{{cite journal|last=Day|first=Davis S.|date=Winter 1980|title=Herbert Hoover and Racial Politics: The De Priest Incident|journal=Journal of Negro History|publisher=Association for the Study of African American Life and History, Inc.|volume=65|issue=1|pages=6\u201317|jstor=3031544|doi=10.2307/3031544}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='A Tempest In a Teapot' The Racial Politics of First Lady Lou Hoover's Invitation of Jessie De Priest to a White House Tea|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/presentations/depriest-tea-incident/|publisher=The White House Historical Association|accessdate=30 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903183357/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/presentations/depriest-tea-incident/|archivedate=3 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDe Priest appointed [[Benjamin O.

De Priest was defeated in 1934 by Democrat [[Arthur W. Mitchell]], who was also African American. After returning to his businesses and political life in Chicago, De Priest was elected again to the Chicago City Council in 1943 as alderman of the 3rd Ward, serving until 1947.

A member of the [[Illinois]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] he was the first [[African American]] to be elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in the 20th century.  During his three terms, he was the only African American serving in Congress.  He served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Illinois' 1st congressional district]] from 1929 to 1935.  De Priest was also the first African-American U.S. Representative from outside the [[Southern United States|southern states]], the first since the [[Reconstruction Era]], and the first since the exit of North Carolina representative [[George Henry White]] from Congress in 1901. \n  \nBorn in Alabama to [[freedmen]] parents, De Priest was raised in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He studied business and made a fortune in Chicago as a contractor, and in real estate and the stock market before the Crash. A successful local politician, he was elected to the [[Chicago City Council]] in 1914, the first African American to hold that office. \n\nIn Congress in the early 1930s, he spoke out against racial discrimination, including at speaking events in the South; tried to integrate the House public restaurant; gained passage of an amendment to [[racial segregation|desegregate]] the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], one of the work programs under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]; and introduced anti-[[lynching]] legislation to the House (it was not passed because of the [[Solid South]] Democratic opposition).  In 1934, De Priest was defeated by [[Arthur W. Mitchell]], the first African American to be elected as a Democrat to Congress.  De Priest returned to Chicago and his successful business ventures, eventually returning to politics, when he was again elected [[Chicago City Council|Chicago alderman]] in the 1940s.\n\n==Early life==\nDe Priest was born in 1871 in [[Florence, Alabama]], to [[freedmen]], former slaves of mixed race. He had a brother named Robert. His mother, Martha Karsner, worked part-time as a laundress, and his father Neander was a [[teamster]], associated with the \"Exodus\" movement. After the Civil War, thousands of blacks left continued oppression by whites in the South by moving to other states that offered promises of freedom and greater economic opportunities, such as Kansas. Others moved later in the century.<ref name=\"stokes\"/>\n\nIn 1878, the year after Reconstruction had ended and federal troops been withdrawn from the region, the De Priests left Alabama for Dayton, Ohio. Violence had increased in Alabama as whites had tried to restore white supremacy: the elder De Priest had to save his friend, former U.S. Representative [[James T. Rapier]], from a [[lynching|lynch mob]], and a black man was killed on their doorstep.<ref name=\"stokes\">{{cite web|last1=Stokes-Hammond|first1=Shelley|title=Pathbreakers: Oscar Stanton DePriest and Jessie L.
