Most aspects of social security in Scotland remain reserved to the United Kingdom and those will remain administered by the DWP\n\nThe Act established [[Social Security Scotland]], an executive agency of the Scottish Government.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\n[[Northern Ireland]] has parity with Great Britain in three areas:\n* [[social security]]\n* [[child support]]\n* [[pensions]]\n\nPolicy in these

the '''Republic of Singapore''', is a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[city-state]] and [[island country]] located in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago|Batam, Bintan, and Karimun archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two [[Early modern period|early modern]] Islamic sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]]. It is postulated that the [[Majapahit]] exercised control over Singapore at some point in its history. Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore. It was then succeeded by the Muslim [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014the final indigenous Malay polity to have exercised control over Singapore prior to its colonisation by the British.|group=Note}} The 1819 arrival of [[Stamford Raffles]], a British colonial officer, and the subsequent establishment of an [[East India Company]] trading post on the island\u2014then part of the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014marked the [[Founding of modern Singapore|genesis of modern Singapore]]. Five years later, the British [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824#History|partitioned the Sultanate]] and coercively wrested Singapore from the [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Sultan's]] control, marking the cessation of indigenous rule over the island for the first time in its history.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula.

According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819-2005 |author= C.M.

Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago|Batam, Bintan, and Karimun archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two [[Early modern period|early modern]] Islamic sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]]. It is postulated that the [[Majapahit]] exercised control over Singapore at some point in its history. Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore. It was then succeeded by the Muslim [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014the final indigenous Malay polity to have exercised control over Singapore prior to its colonisation by the British.|group=Note}} The 1819 arrival of [[Stamford Raffles]], a British colonial officer, and the subsequent establishment of an [[East India Company]] trading post on the island\u2014then part of the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014marked the [[Founding of modern Singapore|genesis of modern Singapore]]. Five years later, the British [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824#History|partitioned the Sultanate]] and coercively wrested Singapore from the [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Sultan's]] control, marking the cessation of indigenous rule over the island for the first time in its history. In 1826, Singapore was incorporated into the [[Straits Settlements]], a pan-[[British Malaya|Malayan]] presidency of the Company with [[Penang]] as capital,<ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/c818356a-e1b9-4f8f-95b3-eee9b3351096]</ref>{{refn|The Straits Settlements were originally composed of (in chronological order) the [[British Malaya]]n peninsular territories of [[Penang]], Singapore, [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. In the 1880s, the Settlements were expanded to include the British Indian Ocean territories of [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]. The last territory to be incorporated into the Settlements was the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] territory of [[Crown Colony of Labuan|Labuan]] in 1907.|group=Note}} and in 1830, the Settlements were annexed to British India as a residency, where they would be governed from the capital of Calcutta under two administrations\u2014until 1858 under [[Company rule in India|Company rule]], and\u2014following the Company's collapse in the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 Indian Rebellion]]\u2014until 1867 under the successive [[British Raj]]. In 1867, the administration of the Settlements was transferred to London, bringing them under the direct control of the [[United Kingdom]] as a Malayan [[crown colony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/372a4e72-9f1b-4eb4-9ec6-58cad02000f0|title=Singapore attains crown colony status}}</ref><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286]</ref><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/372a4e72-9f1b-4eb4-9ec6-58cad02000f0]</ref>\n\nFrom 1867 to the 1940s, Singapore, having taken over Penang as capital of the Settlements, grew into a thriving [[entrep\u00f4t]] and settler-colony under the auspices of the [[British Empire]], attracting large numbers of non-indigenous settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond.<ref>[http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Lloyd97.pdf]</ref> During the [[Second World War]], [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] [[Fall of Singapore|invaded and annexed Singapore]], resulting in an interregnum of British colonial rule corresponding with a brief but bloody [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 to 1945. Following [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, Singapore was returned to British control; in 1946, the Straits Settlements were dissolved, and Singapore became a standalone [[Colony of Singapore|crown colony]]. In 1959, following a protracted period of agitation against colonial rule, Singapore was granted limited autonomy; in 1963, it became fully emancipated from the British Empire upon its [[Malaysia Agreement|federation]] with the territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo]] to form the new country of [[Malaysia]].{{refn|Singapore federated with three other entities to form the country of Malaysia. <br><br> The first entity was the [[Federation of Malaya]], which was the decolonised agglomeration of the peninsular territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]]\u2014composed of the [[Unfederated Malay States]], the [[Federated Malay States]], and the peninsular [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. <br><br> The second and third entities were the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] crown colonies of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], respectively; the latter came to be known as [[Sabah]] after the formation of Malaysia.|group=Note}} However, after [[Singapore in Malaysia|two tumultuous years]] as a constituent state of the Malaysian Federation, marred by violent ethnoreligious [[Ethnic conflict|strife]] and other intractable differences between [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|indigenous]] and non-indigenous groups, Singapore was [[August 1965#August 9, 1965 (Monday)|expelled]] in 1965, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will\u2014although this narrative remains contentious.{{refn|Singapore's secession from the Malaysian Federation in 1965 is a contentious issue without a set historical narrative. The popular narrative is that Singapore was expelled from Malaysia, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will. This is technically correct, as the Malaysian Parliament voted unanimously in favour of Singapore's expulsion from the Federation. <br><br> However, historians believe that Singapore's political leaders might have been acutely aware of the prospect of a breakaway from the very start because of the domestic instability brought about by the incompatibility of worldviews within the Federation\u2014the most major source of acrimony being the steadfast insistence of Singapore's leaders on the concept of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]], not a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-dominated Malaysia ''([[Ketuanan Melayu]])''.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819-2005 |author= C.M.

There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.
