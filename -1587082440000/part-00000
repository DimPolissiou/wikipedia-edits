The effort failed to raise the necessary funds so the private college merged with the state-run Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to form the University of California, the first full-curriculum public university in the state. This designation fulfilled the requirement for access to Morrill Act donated land.\n\nUpon its founding, The Dwinelle Bill (California Assembly Bill No. 583) stated that the \"University shall have for its design, to provide instruction and thorough and complete education in all departments of science, literature and art, industrial and professional pursuits, and general education, and also special courses of instruction in preparation for the professions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UC Berkeley|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|url=http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123024409/http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml|archivedate=November 23, 2010|quote=Founded in the wake of the gold rush by leaders of the newly established 31st state, the University of California's flagship campus at Berkeley has become one of the preeminent universities in the world.|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cio.chance.berkeley.edu/chancellor/sp/flagship.htm|date=October 8, 1998|title=The Future of Flagship Universities|last=Berndahl|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert M.

The oldest unit, Unit 3, has its own dining hall, Caf\u00e9 3, on the first floor.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-3-berkeley|title = Cafe 3|date = |accessdate = |website = Yelp|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> At the beginning of the 2018\u20132019 school year, a new building called Blackwell Hall, was opened across the street from Unit 3. These buildings share a dining hall. Further away and also on the south side of campus is Clark Kerr, an undergraduate residential complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind.\n\nIn the foothills east of the central campus, there are three additional undergraduate residence halls: Foothill, Stern, and Bowles. Foothill is a co-ed, suite-style hall reminiscent of a Swiss chalet. Just south of Foothill, overlooking the Hearst Greek Theatre, is the all-women's traditional-style [[Stern Hall (Berkeley)|Stern Hall]], which boasts an original mural by [[Diego Rivera]]. Because of their proximity to the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[UC Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]], these residence halls often house science and engineering majors. They tend to be quieter than the southside complexes but often get free glimpses of concerts owing to their proximity to the theater. \n\n[[Bowles Hall]], privately owned and the country's oldest residential college, is located on the north side of campus in-between California Memorial Stadium and the Hearst Greek Theater. Gifted by Mary McNear Bowles in 1929 to honor her late husband UC Regent, Philip E.

The birth of the UCSCA, as well as many other cooperative organizations around the country, coincided with the [[Great Depression]] precisely as a response to scant resources. By living together in large houses and pooling together resources, members found that their monetary resources could go further to pay for their cost of living than living separately.\nIn the 1960s, the USCA pioneered the first co-ed university housing in Berkeley (excluding a short-lived \"experiment\" at Barrington Hall), called the Ridge Project (later renamed [[Casa Zimbabwe]]). In 1975, the USCA founded its first and only vegetarian-themed house, Lothlorien. In 1997, the USCA opened its African-American theme house, Afro House, and in 1999 its [[LGBT]]-themed house, named after Irish author and poet [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsc.coop/who-we-are/history |title=BSC history |publisher=Usca.org |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617152214/http://www.bsc.coop/who-we-are/history |archivedate=June 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nNotable alumni of the BSC include [[Marion Nestle]], professor at [[New York University]] and author of Food Politics, and [[Beverly Cleary]], a writer of children's books.\n\n==== Fraternities and sororities ====\n[[File:Thorsen House.jpg|thumb|The residence of the [[Thorsen House#Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House|Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House]], located across the street from the university's [[International House Berkeley|International House]].]]\nUniversity-sanctioned fraternities and sororities comprise over 60 houses that are accredited to one of four Governing Councils, all under the umbrella organization of CalGreeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=About CalGreeks |url=http://lead.berkeley.edu/about-calgreeks/ |website=ASUC Student Union LEADCenter |access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to CalGreeks.com |url=http://www.calgreeks.com/ |website=CalGreeks |access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref> One fraternal organization does not participate in any of the governing bodies or in any of the campus-wide fraternal activities, the [[Thorsen House#Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House|Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House]], which acts instead as an independent [[secret society]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=5|Fraternities <small>(IFC)</small><ref name=\"Greek Life at California\">{{cite web|title=Find a Chapter at the University of California, Berkeley|url=http://lead.berkeley.edu/find-a-chapter/|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}</ref>\n!colspan=2|Sororities <small>(PHC)</small><ref name=\"Greek Life at California\" />\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Alpha Delta Phi]]\n* [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]]\n* [[Alpha Gamma Omega]]\n* [[Alpha Kappa Lambda]]\n* [[Alpha Sigma Phi]]\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Chi Phi]]\n* [[Chi Psi]]\n* [[Delta Chi]]\n* [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]]\n* [[Delta Sigma Phi]]\n* [[Delta Upsilon]]\n* [[Kappa Alpha Order]]\n* [[Kappa Sigma]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Kappa Delta Rho]]\n* [[Nu Alpha Kappa]]\n* [[Phi Delta Theta]]\n* [[Phi Kappa Psi]]\n* [[Phi Kappa Tau]]\n* [[Pi Kappa Alpha]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Pi Kappa Phi]]\n* [[Pi Lambda Phi]]\n* [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]\n* [[Sigma Alpha Mu]]\n* [[Sigma Chi]]\n* [[Sigma Nu]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]\n* [[Sigma Pi]]\n* [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]]\n* [[Theta Chi]]\n* [[Theta Delta Chi]]\n* [[Zeta Beta Tau]]\n* [[Zeta Psi]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Alpha Chi Omega]]\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]]\n* [[Alpha Phi]]\n* [[Chi Omega]]\n* [[Delta Delta Delta]]\n* [[Delta Gamma]]\n* [[Gamma Phi Beta]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]\n* [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]\n* [[Omega Phi Beta]]\n* [[Pi Beta Phi]]\n* [[Sigma Kappa]]\n* [[Sigma Psi Zeta]]\n* [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n|}\n\n=== Student-run organizations ===\n\n==== Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) ====\n{{Main|Associated Students of the University of California}}\n[[File:Wellness Room.jpg|thumb|Wellness Room sleep pods: part of a program created by the ASUC, UC Berkeley's official student association]]\nThe [[Associated Students of the University of California]] (ASUC) is the official [[student association]] that controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events.

The [[UC Men's Octet]] is an eight-member a cappella group founded in 1948 featuring a repertoire of barbershop, doo-wop, contemporary pop, modern alternative, and fight songs. They are one of only two multiple time champions of the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]], having won the championship in both 1998 and 2000. The California Golden Overtones, founded in 1984, have a very similar repertoire to the Octet. Noteworthy competed in Season 5 of America's Got Talent. It is a tradition for every Berkeley a cappella group to perform under the campus' Sather Gate each week at different times during the week. In addition to a Capella, Berkeley is host to a myriad of other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music. A few examples include ''[[jericho!]]'' Improv & Sketch Comedy, The Movement, Taiko drumming, BareStage student musical theater, the Remedy Music Project, Main Stacks, AFX Dance, and TruElement.\n\nSince 1967, students and staff jazz musicians have had an opportunity to perform and study with the [[University of California Jazz Ensembles]]. Under the direction of Dr. David W. Tucker, who was hired by the [[Cal Band]] as a composer, arranger, and associate director, but was later asked to direct the jazz ensembles as it grew in popularity and membership, the group grew rapidly from one big band to multiple big bands, numerous combos, and numerous instrumental classes with multiple instructors. For several decades it hosted the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, part of the American Collegiate Jazz Festival, a competitive forum for student musicians. PCCJF brought jazz luminaries such as [[Hubert Laws]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], and [[Ed Shaughnessy]] to the Berkeley campus as performers, clinicians, and adjudicators. The festival later included high school musicians. The jazz ensembles became an effective recruitment tool. Many high school musicians interested in strong academics as well as jazz found that the campus met both interests. Numerous alumni have had successful careers in jazz performance and education including [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]] and [[Andy Narell]].\n\nUC Berkeley also hosts many conferences, talks, and musical and theatrical performances.

The effort failed to raise the necessary funds so the private college merged with the state-run Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to form the University of California, the first full-curriculum public university in the state. This designation fulfilled the requirement for access to Morrill Act donated land.\n\nUpon its founding, The Dwinelle Bill (California Assembly Bill No. 583) stated that the \"University shall have for its design, to provide instruction and thorough and complete education in all departments of science, literature and art, industrial and professional pursuits, and general education, and also special courses of instruction in preparation for the professions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UC Berkeley|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|url=http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123024409/http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml|archivedate=November 23, 2010|quote=Founded in the wake of the gold rush by leaders of the newly established 31st state, the University of California's flagship campus at Berkeley has become one of the preeminent universities in the world.|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cio.chance.berkeley.edu/chancellor/sp/flagship.htm|date=October 8, 1998|title=The Future of Flagship Universities|last=Berndahl|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert M.

The birth of the UCSCA, as well as many other cooperative organizations around the country, coincided with the [[Great Depression]] precisely as a response to scant resources. By living together in large houses and pooling together resources, members found that their monetary resources could go further to pay for their cost of living than living separately.\nIn the 1960s, the USCA pioneered the first co-ed university housing in Berkeley (excluding a short-lived \"experiment\" at Barrington Hall), called the Ridge Project (later renamed [[Casa Zimbabwe]]). In 1975, the USCA founded its first and only vegetarian-themed house, Lothlorien. In 1997, the USCA opened its African-American theme house, Afro House, and in 1999 its [[LGBT]]-themed house, named after Irish author and poet [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsc.coop/who-we-are/history |title=BSC history |publisher=Usca.org |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617152214/http://www.bsc.coop/who-we-are/history |archivedate=June 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nNotable alumni of the BSC include [[Marion Nestle]], professor at [[New York University]] and author of Food Politics, and [[Beverly Cleary]], a writer of children's books.\n\n==== Fraternities and sororities ====\n[[File:Thorsen House.jpg|thumb|The residence of the [[Thorsen House#Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House|Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House]], located across the street from the university's [[International House Berkeley|International House]].]]\nUniversity-sanctioned fraternities and sororities comprise over 60 houses that are accredited to one of four Governing Councils, all under the umbrella organization of CalGreeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=About CalGreeks |url=http://lead.berkeley.edu/about-calgreeks/ |website=ASUC Student Union LEADCenter |access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to CalGreeks.com |url=http://www.calgreeks.com/ |website=CalGreeks |access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref> One fraternal organization does not participate in any of the governing bodies or in any of the campus-wide fraternal activities, the [[Thorsen House#Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House|Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House]], which acts instead as an independent [[secret society]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=5|Fraternities <small>(IFC)</small><ref name=\"Greek Life at California\">{{cite web|title=Find a Chapter at the University of California, Berkeley|url=http://lead.berkeley.edu/find-a-chapter/|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}</ref>\n!colspan=2|Sororities <small>(PHC)</small><ref name=\"Greek Life at California\" />\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Alpha Delta Phi]]\n* [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]]\n* [[Alpha Gamma Omega]]\n* [[Alpha Kappa Lambda]]\n* [[Alpha Sigma Phi]]\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Chi Phi]]\n* [[Chi Psi]]\n* [[Delta Chi]]\n* [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]]\n* [[Delta Sigma Phi]]\n* [[Delta Upsilon]]\n* [[Kappa Alpha Order]]\n* [[Kappa Sigma]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Kappa Delta Rho]]\n* [[Nu Alpha Kappa]]\n* [[Phi Delta Theta]]\n* [[Phi Kappa Psi]]\n* [[Phi Kappa Tau]]\n* [[Pi Kappa Alpha]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Pi Kappa Phi]]\n* [[Pi Lambda Phi]]\n* [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]\n* [[Sigma Alpha Mu]]\n* [[Sigma Chi]]\n* [[Sigma Nu]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]\n* [[Sigma Pi]]\n* [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]]\n* [[Theta Chi]]\n* [[Theta Delta Chi]]\n* [[Zeta Beta Tau]]\n* [[Zeta Psi]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Alpha Chi Omega]]\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]]\n* [[Alpha Phi]]\n* [[Chi Omega]]\n* [[Delta Delta Delta]]\n* [[Delta Gamma]]\n* [[Gamma Phi Beta]]\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:smaller;\"|\n* [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]\n* [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]\n* [[Omega Phi Beta]]\n* [[Pi Beta Phi]]\n* [[Sigma Kappa]]\n* [[Sigma Psi Zeta]]\n* [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n|}\n\n=== Student-run organizations ===\n\n==== Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) ====\n{{Main|Associated Students of the University of California}}\n[[File:Wellness Room.jpg|thumb|Wellness Room sleep pods: part of a program created by the ASUC, UC Berkeley's official student association]]\nThe [[Associated Students of the University of California]] (ASUC) is the official [[student association]] that controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events.

The [[UC Men's Octet]] is an eight-member a cappella group founded in 1948 featuring a repertoire of barbershop, doo-wop, contemporary pop, modern alternative, and fight songs. They are one of only two multiple time champions of the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]], having won the championship in both 1998 and 2000. The California Golden Overtones, founded in 1984, have a very similar repertoire to the Octet. Noteworthy competed in Season 5 of America's Got Talent. It is a tradition for every Berkeley a cappella group to perform under the campus' Sather Gate each week at different times during the week. In addition to a Capella, Berkeley is host to a myriad of other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music. A few examples include ''[[jericho!]]'' Improv & Sketch Comedy, The Movement, Taiko drumming, BareStage student musical theater, the Remedy Music Project, Main Stacks, AFX Dance, and TruElement.\n\nSince 1967, students and staff jazz musicians have had an opportunity to perform and study with the [[University of California Jazz Ensembles]]. Under the direction of Dr. David W. Tucker, who was hired by the [[Cal Band]] as a composer, arranger, and associate director, but was later asked to direct the jazz ensembles as it grew in popularity and membership, the group grew rapidly from one big band to multiple big bands, numerous combos, and numerous instrumental classes with multiple instructors. For several decades it hosted the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, part of the American Collegiate Jazz Festival, a competitive forum for student musicians. PCCJF brought jazz luminaries such as [[Hubert Laws]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], and [[Ed Shaughnessy]] to the Berkeley campus as performers, clinicians, and adjudicators. The festival later included high school musicians. The jazz ensembles became an effective recruitment tool. Many high school musicians interested in strong academics as well as jazz found that the campus met both interests. Numerous alumni have had successful careers in jazz performance and education including [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]] and [[Andy Narell]].\n\nUC Berkeley also hosts many conferences, talks, and musical and theatrical performances. Many of these events, including the Annual UC Berkeley Sociological Research Symposium, are completely planned and organized by undergraduate students.\n\n=== Athletics ===\n{{Main|California Golden Bears}}\n[[File:California Memorial Stadium 2015.jpg|thumb|California Memorial Stadium]]\n[[File:HaasPavillion UCBerkeley.jpg|thumb|The interior of Haas Pavilion during a basketball game]]\n[[File:Hellman Tennis Complex 1.JPG|thumb|Hellman Tennis Complex]]\nThe athletic teams at UC Berkeley are known as the [[California Golden Bears]] (often shortened to \"Cal Bears\" or just \"Cal\") and are primarily members of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Pac-12 Conference]] (Pac-12).

Released on 2 October 1995 by [[Creation Records]], it was produced by [[Owen Morris]] and the group's guitarist and main songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]]. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). Gallagher's compositions were more focused in [[ballad]]ry and placed more emphasis on \"huge\" choruses,<ref name=\"oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk/?page_id=247|title=Owen Morris on producing Morning Glory|work=oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219023717/http://www.oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk/?page_id=247|archivedate=19 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. ''Morning Glory'' was the group's first album with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], who replaced [[Tony McCarroll]].\n\nThe record propelled Oasis from being a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] [[Independent music|indie]] act to a worldwide rock phenomenon, and is seen by critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music.<ref name=\"Seven Ages of Rock, What the World is Waiting For\">Seven Ages of Rock: What the World is Waiting For</ref> ''Morning Glory'' sold a record-breaking 347,000 copies in its first week, spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], making it the band's most commercially successful release. Singles from the album were successful in Britain, America, and Australia: \"[[Some Might Say]]\" and \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" reached No. 1 in the UK, while \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\" and \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\" reached No. 1 on the [[Alternative Songs|US Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, with the latter also topping the Australian and New Zealand singles charts.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steffen|last=Hung |url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Oasis&titel=Wonderwall&cat=s |title=Oasis&nbsp;\u2014 Wonderwall |website=australian-charts.com |accessdate=10 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1996 Brit Awards]], the album won Best British Album. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. Among the most notable of these concerts were back-to-back nights at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London in November 1995, which were the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time. They also performed two \"homecoming\" gigs at [[Maine Road]] in Manchester in April 1996. In August of that year, the band played to 80,000 people over two nights at [[Balloch Country Park]] in Scotland. A week later, they held what is arguably their most famous concert when they played two consecutive nights at [[Knebworth House|Knebworth]] to a combined crowd of 250,000 people{{emdash}}for the Knebworth performance, it is believed that approximately 2.5 million people (an estimated 4.4% of the entire UK population at the time) applied for tickets.\n\nAlthough a commercial success, the record initially received lukewarm reviews from mainstream critics; many reviewers deemed it inferior to ''Definitely Maybe'', with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. However, critical opinion towards the album completely reversed in the ensuing years, and it is now generally considered a seminal record of both the [[Britpop]] era and the 1990s in general, as well as appearing on several lists of the greatest albums in rock music. At the [[2010 Brit Awards]], ''Morning Glory'' was named the greatest British album since 1980.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8517579.stm|title=Lady Gaga wins Brit Awards triple|date=16 February 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 June 2010}}</ref> It has sold over 22 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/06/noel-gallagher-oasis|title=Interview: Noel Gallagher talks Oasis past and present|date=2008-12-06|work=The Guardian}}</ref> As of October 2018, it is the UK's [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fifth best-selling album]] and third best-selling studio album of all time, having sold over 4.94 million copies,<ref name=\"UK sales\">{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/uk-s-60-biggest-selling-albums-of-all-time-revealed/065239|title=UK's 60 Biggest Selling Albums of All Time|last=Gumble|first=Daniel|date=5 July 2016|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> and was also the [[List of best-selling albums of the 1990s in the United Kingdom|UK's best-selling album of the 1990s]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn May 1995, in the wake of the critical and commercial success of their 1994 debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', Oasis began recording ''Morning Glory'' at [[Rockfield Studios]] in [[Wales]], with [[Owen Morris]] and [[Noel Gallagher]] producing.<ref name=MOJO>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AVQbF9lTBwgC&pg=PA622#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Mojo Collection |publisher=Canongate Books|date= 1 November 2007 |accessdate=11 January 2012 |isbn= 978-1-84767-643-6}}</ref> By the time they had finished in June 1995, Oasis were on the brink of becoming one of the most popular bands in the UK; the August 1995 [[Battle of Britpop]] incident in which Oasis and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] had a chart battle over their respective singles \"[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]\" and \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\" would propel them to mainstream awareness.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">\n{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/12/pulp.popandrock\n|title=Remember the first time\n|department=Music\n|work=The Guardian\n|first=John\n|last=Harris\n|location=London\n|date=12 August 2005\n|issn=0261-3077\n|oclc=60623878\n|accessdate=9 January 2012\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HYUifI9rdsoC&pg=PA232#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Revolution Rock: The Albums Which Defined Two Ages|page=232 |first=Amy  |last=Britton| publisher=AuthorHouse |date= Nov 2011 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |isbn= 978-1-4678-8711-3}}</ref>\n\nDespite the friction between the Gallagher brothers, Owen Morris reflected in 2010 that: \"The sessions were the best, easiest, least fraught, most happily creative time I've ever had in a recording studio.

The backing track was faster than intended, with what Morris described as \"a really bad speed up during the first three bars of the first chorus\", but the take had to be used because those involved were impressed with Liam's vocals, and Morris had to mix the track three times, using delay and other processing to hide the mistakes.<ref name=\"owen morris\" /> When the album was finished, Morris said it would \"wipe the field with any competition&nbsp;... It's astonishing. It's the ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols|Bollocks]]'' for this decade.\"<ref>Harris, p. 227</ref> [[Creation Records]] boss [[Alan McGee]] was similarly enthused, saying that \"You just cannot slag this record.

Music journalist Nick Southall, who has written extensively on the loudness war, commented, \"If there's a [[jump the shark|jump-the-shark]] moment as far as CD mastering goes then it's probably Oasis.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/imperfect-sound-forever.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330012544/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/imperfect-sound-forever.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2018 |title=Imperfect Sound Forever \u2013 Stylus Magazine |website=stylusmagazine.com |accessdate=7 June 2017 }}</ref> In ''Britpop and the English Music Tradition'' Andy Bennet and John Stratton noted that as a result of this technique \"the songs were especially loud. [Liam] Gallagher's voice is foregrounded to the point that it appears to grow out of the mixes of the songs, exposing itself to execute a pseudo-live quality.\"<ref>Stratton; Bennet, p. 149</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] commented in his music history ''Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock'' that much of the music on ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' seemed to be \"little more inspired than a string of musical hand-me-downs\". Among the musical cues Harris noted on the album were [[Gary Glitter]]'s \"[[Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again]]\" (\"Hello\", Glitter was an influence on Britpop), the theme to the 1970s children's programme ''[[You and Me (UK TV series)|You and Me]]'' and [[The Beatles]]' \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" (\"She's Electric\"), and the influence of [[R.E.M.]]'s \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\" on \"Morning Glory\". One song, \"Step Out\", bore such a close resemblance to the song \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]] that it was removed from the album shortly before release due to the threat of legal action.<ref name=\"Harris, p. 253\u201354\">Harris, p.&nbsp;253\u201354</ref> In ''Britpop&nbsp;...'', Bennet and Stratton analysed Liam Gallagher's vocal style in significant detail, stressing its importance to the songs of the album; \"[Liam's] Mancunian accent blends into a register and timbre that works the gestural contours of the melody and lyrics.\" Bennet and Stratton went on to conclude that Liam's 'over-personalized' style on songs such as \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\" resulted in \"a beautiful sense of sentimentality that bespeaks the despondency of a generation. This occurs through the narrative structure of the song, vocal production, and the conventions of the singer's cultural context.\"<ref>Stratton; Bennet, p.&nbsp;148\u201349</ref>\n\nNoel Gallagher summed up his own perspective on the album's aesthetic in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1995; \"Whilst [''Definitely Maybe''] is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band, ''What's the Story'' is about actually ''being'' a pop star in a band.\"<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/part-8-1997-the-ballad-of-oasis-and-radiohead,50557/ The AV Club: Alternative Nation \u2013 Part 8: ''The Ballad of Oasis and Radiohead'']</ref> The album has a notable anthemic theme to its songs, differing from the rawness and edged rock of ''Definitely Maybe''. The use of string arrangements and more varied instrumentation in songs such as \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" and \"Champagne Supernova\" was a significant departure from the band's debut. This style had first been implemented by the band on their fifth single, \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\", released in December 1994. It was produced in conjunction with the London Symphony Orchestra, resulting in a much more pop-oriented and mellower sound; this would be the template that would come to define many of the songs on ''What's the Story''.<ref name = \"BBC sevenages\">{{BBC Online|id=music/sevenages/|title='Seven Ages'}}</ref> In the BBC documentary ''[[Seven Ages of Rock]]'', former NME chief editor Steve Sutherland noted that \"with ''Morning Glory'', [Noel] began to take seriously the notion of being the voice of a generation\".<ref name= \"BBC sevenages\"/>\n\n==Cover==\nThe cover is a picture of two men passing each other on [[Berwick Street]] in London.

This was an unorthodox method for the time, contrasting the standard industry procedure of releasing the lead single three weeks before its parent album.<ref>Harris, p. 250: \"Blur had assumed that Oasis would follow standard music business protocol, releasing a single three weeks before the album.\"</ref> [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s management had become worried that this would hinder the chances of the group's forthcoming \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\" single reaching number one the following week. As a reaction, [[Food Records]] pushed the release of \"Country House\" back a week and thus started what became known as '[[The Battle of Britpop]]'.\n\nThe event triggered an unprecedented amount of exposure for both bands in national newspapers and on television news bulletins, supposedly symbolising the battle between the middle class of the south and the working class of the north. In the midst of the battle a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper headline proclaimed \"Working Class Heroes Lead Art School Trendies\". In the event \"Country House\" outsold \"Roll with It\" by 54,000, and topped the singles chart for a fortnight. Overall singles sales that week were up by 41 percent.<ref>Harris, p.&nbsp;229\u2013235</ref> In 2005, John Harris reflected on the importance of the event in popularising Britpop; \"(as) Blur's \"Country House\" raced Oasis' \"Roll with It\" to the top of the charts, just about every voice in the media felt compelled to express an opinion on the freshly inaugurated age of Britpop.\"<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\nDuring a promotional interview in September, the month before the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] from Blur, and was quoted in the 17 September edition of ''[[The Observer]]'' saying he hoped \"the pair of them would catch [[AIDS]] and die because I fucking hate them two.\"<ref name=\"Harris, p. 250\">Harris, p. 250</ref> Although Noel recanted and said that AIDS is no laughing matter,<ref name=\"apology\">{{cite web | author=Titorenko, Mark|date=19 February 1996 | title=Noel's AIDS comment | publisher=The Oasis Archive | url=http://ireland.iol.ie/~kglennon/paper/bandi.htm| accessdate=17 January 2006}} (scroll down to section 3.5)</ref> the quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that \"my whole world came crashing down in on me then\".<ref name=\"Harris, p. 250\"/> However, in an interview with ''The Guardian'' in 2005, Blur's guitarist [[Graham Coxon]] explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. \"At least they were outright about it.

In that way, I quite appreciated them.\"<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\nOn 2 October 2018, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the album release, a new lyric video, described as being \"loaded with psychedelic imagery\", was published on the band's YouTube VEVO channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/oasis-unveil-new-lyric-video-shes-electric-2385754#MjylkVUuoic6Klkf.99|title=Oasis unveil new lyric video for 'She's Electric' - NME|date=2 October 2018|publisher=nme.com|accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|h9JZWhjQDvc|Oasis - She's Electric (Lyric Video)}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' was released on 2 October 1995. The album sold quickly; the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported the day after release that central London [[HMV]] stores were selling copies of the album at a rate of two per minute. At the end of the first week of sales, the album had sold a record-breaking 347,000 copies, making it (at the time) the second-fastest-selling album in British history, behind [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. After initially entering the UK charts at number one, it hovered around the top three for the rest of the year before initiating a six-week stay at the top in mid January, followed by a further three weeks at number one in March. In total, the album did not leave the top three for an astonishing seven months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/%28What%27s%20The%20Story%29%20Morning%20Glory%3F|title=ChartArchive - The Chart Archive|website=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fourth single from the album, \"Wonderwall\", hit the top ten in several countries, including stays at number one in Australia and New Zealand and achieving a peak of number eight in the United States, the album began to enjoy prolonged international success. Eventually the album had a five-week run at the top of the Australian albums chart and an eight-week run at the top of the New Zealand albums chart before topping charts in Canada, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland. The album was also making significant waves in the US market, thanks in part to the success of the \"Wonderwall\" and \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\" singles on American modern rock radio. Both songs reached number one on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Chart]] and stayed there for ten and five weeks respectively. By early 1996, ''What's the Story'' was selling 200,000 copies a week, eventually peaking at number four and being certified four times platinum by the end of the year for shipments of over four million units.<ref>Harris, p. 261</ref>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|(What's the Story) Morning Glory?

Released on 2 October 1995 by [[Creation Records]], it was produced by [[Owen Morris]] and the group's guitarist and main songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]]. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). Gallagher's compositions were more focused in [[ballad]]ry and placed more emphasis on \"huge\" choruses,<ref name=\"oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk/?page_id=247|title=Owen Morris on producing Morning Glory|work=oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219023717/http://www.oasis-recordinginfo.co.uk/?page_id=247|archivedate=19 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. ''Morning Glory'' was the group's first album with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], who replaced [[Tony McCarroll]].\n\nThe record propelled Oasis from being a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] [[Independent music|indie]] act to a worldwide rock phenomenon, and is seen by critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music.<ref name=\"Seven Ages of Rock, What the World is Waiting For\">Seven Ages of Rock: What the World is Waiting For</ref> ''Morning Glory'' sold a record-breaking 347,000 copies in its first week, spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], making it the band's most commercially successful release. Singles from the album were successful in Britain, America, and Australia: \"[[Some Might Say]]\" and \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" reached No. 1 in the UK, while \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\" and \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\" reached No. 1 on the [[Alternative Songs|US Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, with the latter also topping the Australian and New Zealand singles charts.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steffen|last=Hung |url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Oasis&titel=Wonderwall&cat=s |title=Oasis&nbsp;\u2014 Wonderwall |website=australian-charts.com |accessdate=10 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1996 Brit Awards]], the album won Best British Album. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. Among the most notable of these concerts were back-to-back nights at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London in November 1995, which were the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time. They also performed two \"homecoming\" gigs at [[Maine Road]] in Manchester in April 1996. In August of that year, the band played to 80,000 people over two nights at [[Balloch Country Park]] in Scotland. A week later, they held what is arguably their most famous concert when they played two consecutive nights at [[Knebworth House|Knebworth]] to a combined crowd of 250,000 people{{emdash}}for the Knebworth performance, it is believed that approximately 2.5 million people (an estimated 4.4% of the entire UK population at the time) applied for tickets.\n\nAlthough a commercial success, the record initially received lukewarm reviews from mainstream critics; many reviewers deemed it inferior to ''Definitely Maybe'', with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism.

The backing track was faster than intended, with what Morris described as \"a really bad speed up during the first three bars of the first chorus\", but the take had to be used because those involved were impressed with Liam's vocals, and Morris had to mix the track three times, using delay and other processing to hide the mistakes.<ref name=\"owen morris\" /> When the album was finished, Morris said it would \"wipe the field with any competition&nbsp;... It's astonishing. It's the ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols|Bollocks]]'' for this decade.\"<ref>Harris, p. 227</ref> [[Creation Records]] boss [[Alan McGee]] was similarly enthused, saying that \"You just cannot slag this record.

[Liam] Gallagher's voice is foregrounded to the point that it appears to grow out of the mixes of the songs, exposing itself to execute a pseudo-live quality.\"<ref>Stratton; Bennet, p. 149</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] commented in his music history ''Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock'' that much of the music on ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' seemed to be \"little more inspired than a string of musical hand-me-downs\". Among the musical cues Harris noted on the album were [[Gary Glitter]]'s \"[[Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again]]\" (\"Hello\", Glitter was an influence on Britpop), the theme to the 1970s children's programme ''[[You and Me (UK TV series)|You and Me]]'' and [[The Beatles]]' \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" (\"She's Electric\"), and the influence of [[R.E.M.]]'s \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\" on \"Morning Glory\". One song, \"Step Out\", bore such a close resemblance to the song \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]] that it was removed from the album shortly before release due to the threat of legal action.<ref name=\"Harris, p. 253\u201354\">Harris, p.&nbsp;253\u201354</ref> In ''Britpop&nbsp;...'', Bennet and Stratton analysed Liam Gallagher's vocal style in significant detail, stressing its importance to the songs of the album; \"[Liam's] Mancunian accent blends into a register and timbre that works the gestural contours of the melody and lyrics.\" Bennet and Stratton went on to conclude that Liam's 'over-personalized' style on songs such as \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\" resulted in \"a beautiful sense of sentimentality that bespeaks the despondency of a generation. This occurs through the narrative structure of the song, vocal production, and the conventions of the singer's cultural context.\"<ref>Stratton; Bennet, p.&nbsp;148\u201349</ref>\n\nNoel Gallagher summed up his own perspective on the album's aesthetic in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1995; \"Whilst [''Definitely Maybe''] is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band, ''What's the Story'' is about actually ''being'' a pop star in a band.\"<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/part-8-1997-the-ballad-of-oasis-and-radiohead,50557/ The AV Club: Alternative Nation \u2013 Part 8: ''The Ballad of Oasis and Radiohead'']</ref> The album has a notable anthemic theme to its songs, differing from the rawness and edged rock of ''Definitely Maybe''. The use of string arrangements and more varied instrumentation in songs such as \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" and \"Champagne Supernova\" was a significant departure from the band's debut. This style had first been implemented by the band on their fifth single, \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\", released in December 1994. It was produced in conjunction with the London Symphony Orchestra, resulting in a much more pop-oriented and mellower sound; this would be the template that would come to define many of the songs on ''What's the Story''.<ref name = \"BBC sevenages\">{{BBC Online|id=music/sevenages/|title='Seven Ages'}}</ref> In the BBC documentary ''[[Seven Ages of Rock]]'', former NME chief editor Steve Sutherland noted that \"with ''Morning Glory'', [Noel] began to take seriously the notion of being the voice of a generation\".<ref name= \"BBC sevenages\"/>\n\n==Cover==\nThe cover is a picture of two men passing each other on [[Berwick Street]] in London.

This was an unorthodox method for the time, contrasting the standard industry procedure of releasing the lead single three weeks before its parent album.<ref>Harris, p. 250: \"Blur had assumed that Oasis would follow standard music business protocol, releasing a single three weeks before the album.\"</ref> [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s management had become worried that this would hinder the chances of the group's forthcoming \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\" single reaching number one the following week. As a reaction, [[Food Records]] pushed the release of \"Country House\" back a week and thus started what became known as '[[The Battle of Britpop]]'.\n\nThe event triggered an unprecedented amount of exposure for both bands in national newspapers and on television news bulletins, supposedly symbolising the battle between the middle class of the south and the working class of the north. In the midst of the battle a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper headline proclaimed \"Working Class Heroes Lead Art School Trendies\". In the event \"Country House\" outsold \"Roll with It\" by 54,000, and topped the singles chart for a fortnight. Overall singles sales that week were up by 41 percent.<ref>Harris, p.&nbsp;229\u2013235</ref> In 2005, John Harris reflected on the importance of the event in popularising Britpop; \"(as) Blur's \"Country House\" raced Oasis' \"Roll with It\" to the top of the charts, just about every voice in the media felt compelled to express an opinion on the freshly inaugurated age of Britpop.\"<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\nDuring a promotional interview in September, the month before the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] from Blur, and was quoted in the 17 September edition of ''[[The Observer]]'' saying he hoped \"the pair of them would catch [[AIDS]] and die because I fucking hate them two.\"<ref name=\"Harris, p. 250\">Harris, p. 250</ref> Although Noel recanted and said that AIDS is no laughing matter,<ref name=\"apology\">{{cite web | author=Titorenko, Mark|date=19 February 1996 | title=Noel's AIDS comment | publisher=The Oasis Archive | url=http://ireland.iol.ie/~kglennon/paper/bandi.htm| accessdate=17 January 2006}} (scroll down to section 3.5)</ref> the quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that \"my whole world came crashing down in on me then\".<ref name=\"Harris, p. 250\"/> However, in an interview with ''The Guardian'' in 2005, Blur's guitarist [[Graham Coxon]] explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. \"At least they were outright about it.

In that way, I quite appreciated them.\"<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\nOn 2 October 2018, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the album release, a new lyric video, described as being \"loaded with psychedelic imagery\", was published on the band's YouTube VEVO channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/oasis-unveil-new-lyric-video-shes-electric-2385754#MjylkVUuoic6Klkf.99|title=Oasis unveil new lyric video for 'She's Electric' - NME|date=2 October 2018|publisher=nme.com|accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|h9JZWhjQDvc|Oasis - She's Electric (Lyric Video)}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' was released on 2 October 1995. The album sold quickly; the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported the day after release that central London [[HMV]] stores were selling copies of the album at a rate of two per minute. At the end of the first week of sales, the album had sold a record-breaking 347,000 copies, making it (at the time) the second-fastest-selling album in British history, behind [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. After initially entering the UK charts at number one, it hovered around the top three for the rest of the year before initiating a six-week stay at the top in mid January, followed by a further three weeks at number one in March. In total, the album did not leave the top three for an astonishing seven months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/%28What%27s%20The%20Story%29%20Morning%20Glory%3F|title=ChartArchive - The Chart Archive|website=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fourth single from the album, \"Wonderwall\", hit the top ten in several countries, including stays at number one in Australia and New Zealand and achieving a peak of number eight in the United States, the album began to enjoy prolonged international success. Eventually the album had a five-week run at the top of the Australian albums chart and an eight-week run at the top of the New Zealand albums chart before topping charts in Canada, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland. The album was also making significant waves in the US market, thanks in part to the success of the \"Wonderwall\" and \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\" singles on American modern rock radio. Both songs reached number one on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Chart]] and stayed there for ten and five weeks respectively. By early 1996, ''What's the Story'' was selling 200,000 copies a week, eventually peaking at number four and being certified four times platinum by the end of the year for shipments of over four million units.<ref>Harris, p. 261</ref>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|(What's the Story) Morning Glory?

The RPG elements of the game are very simplistic; which allows casual videogame-players to play the game with ease, but which can be disappointing for fans of RPGs who want more of a strategic challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/ring-fit-adventure |title=The Legend of Zelda: Ring Fit Adventure for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Sales ===\n''Ring Fit Adventure'' debuted at #3 in the UK,<ref>{{cite web |last=Batchelor |first=James |date=October 21, 2019 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-21-uk-charts-switch-dominates-as-the-witcher-3-leads-slew-of-new-releases |title=UK Charts: Switch dominates as The Witcher 3 leads slew of new releases |website=[[Gamer Network|GamesIndustry.biz]] |accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> and #1 in Japan and South Korea.<ref>https://gematsu.com/2019/10/famitsu-sales-10-14-19-10-20-19</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=187740 |title=MediaCreate 10 \u6708 14 \u65e5\uff5e10 \u6708 20 \u65e5\u4e00\u9031\u92b7\u552e\u6392\u884c\u699c \u300a\u5065\u8eab\u74b0\u5927\u5192\u96aa\u300b\u518d\u6380\u9ad4\u611f\u71b1\u6f6e |website=\u5df4\u54c8\u59c6\u7279\u96fb\u73a9\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7ad9 |accessdate=November 5, 2019}}</ref> In Japan, it sold 68,497 copies within its first week on sale, which placed it at number one on the all format sales chart.<ref>{{cite web |last=Romano |first=Sal |date=October 23, 2019 |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/10/famitsu-sales-10-14-19-10-20-19\u00a0|title=Famitsu Sales: 10/14/19 \u2013 10/20/19 [Update] |publisher=Gematsu |accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref> As of December 2019, the game has shipped 2.17 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/200130_3e.pdf|title=Million Sellers Titles of Nintendo Products|page=7|accessdate=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDue to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], demand for the game increased significantly, creating shortages.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus Fears Spark a Run on Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure |url=https://www.wired.com/story/ring-fit-shortage-coronavirus-covid-19/ |website=Wired |accessdate=13 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chinese consumers snap up yoga mats, video games, condoms as coronavirus keeps them at home |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-consumer/chinese-consumers-snap-up-yoga-mats-video-games-condoms-as-coronavirus-keeps-them-at-home-idUSKBN20J1JL |website=Reuters |accessdate=13 March 2020 |language=en |date=25 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Family Game\" at [[The Game Awards 2019]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Winslow |first=Jeremy |date=November 19, 2019 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2019-nominees-full-list/1100-6471564/ |title=The Game Awards 2019 Nominees Full List |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref> for \"Family Game of the Year\" at the [[23rd Annual D.I.C.E.
