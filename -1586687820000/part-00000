Fadak was conquered by Muhammad. The Qur'an says: \u201cAnd that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.  -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur\u2019an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle. From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai as the head of the Islamic republic.<ref>http://www.muslimtents.com/shaufi/b16/b16_13.htm</ref>\n\nAccording to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations regarding this are weak. As far as the claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of the Quran, \"And give the relative his right\",<ref>Quran, Surah Isra, verse 26</ref> was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter as it was her right.\nBut, there are several famous Sunni scholars who specify that the revelation of 17:26<ref>[http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/17:26 17:26]</ref> is about Fadak transmission from the Prophet to Fatima, such as: Razi,<ref>[Razi in the book \"Aljrh and Altdyl\" vol. 1, p. 257]</ref> Suyuti,<ref name=\"Suyuti p. 158\">[Suyuti (Vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 5, pp.273_274)]</ref> Khwarizmi,<ref name=\"Suyuti p. 158\"/> Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi<ref>[Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi (vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 3, p. 767)]</ref> and so on.\n\nFatimah However Agreed and Was Satisfied With The Decision of Abu Bakr after He Came to Fatimah's House and Discussed The Matter With Ali and Fatima.\nDarqutni,Ameer ul Mu'mineen Fil Hadith reports a narration From Umme Hani in his Al ilal,\n                           \"Umme Hani Told Fatimah Told Abu Bakr Told That The Holy Prophet Peace Be Upon him said That We Prophets Don't have \n                                                 inheritors, instead What we leave is Charity for the Ummah\"\n                                                         <ref>Darqutni,Al ilal ,1:231:34</ref>\nReporting of Fatimah the Hadith on the Authority of Abu Bakr Proves That She Was Satisfied.\n\n=== Fadak under the Umayyads (661 &ndash; 750) ===\n[[Mu'awiyah]], the first [[Ummayad|Umayyad Caliph]] did not return Fadak to [[Fatimah]]'s descendants. This way was continued by later [[Ummayad|Umayyad Caliphs]] until [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] seized power.\nWhen [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]], known as [[Umar II]], became Caliph in 717 CE, the income from the property of Fadak was 40,000 dinars.<ref>[[Sunan Abu Dawud]], v3, p144, Dhikr Fa'y</ref> Fadak was returned to Fatima's descendants by an edict given by [[Umar II]],<ref>[[Wafa al-Wafa]], page 99</ref> but this decision was renounced by later caliphs.[[Umar II]]'s successor, [[Yazid II|Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik]] (known as [[Yazid II]]) overturned his decision, and Fadak was again made public trust. Fadak was then managed this way until the [[Ummayad Caliphate]] expired.\n\n=== Fadak under the Abbasids (750 &ndash; 1258) ===\nIn year 747 CE, a huge revolt against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] occurred. The Umayyad's were eventually defeated by the [[Abbasid]] army under the rule of [[As-Saffah|Abu Abbas Abdullah al-Saffah]] (see [[Battle of the Zab]]) in year 750. The last [[Umayyad]] Caliph, [[Marwan II]], was killed in a lesser battle a few months after the [[Battle of the Zab]], thus ending the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].\nHistorical accounts differs on what happened to Fadak under the early Abbasid caliphs. There is however consensus among [[Islamic scholar]]s that Fadak was granted to the descendants of Fatimah during [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s reign as Caliph (831-833 CE). Al-Ma\u2019mun even decreed this to be recorded in his ''(d\u012bw\u0101ns)''.  \nAl-Ma\u2019mun's successor,  [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (847-861) recaptured Fadak from the progeny of Fatimah, decreeing it to be used for the purposes initially outlined by Abu Bakr. [[Al-Muntasir]] (861-862), however, apparently maintained the decision of [[Al-Ma'mun]], thus allowing Fatimah's progeny to manage Fadak.<ref>As stated in Tarikh Yaqubi (2:199, 3:48), Wafa al Wafa vol 3 p 999-1000, Tarikh ul Khulafa, p 231-32</ref> \nWhat happened hereafter is uncertain, but Fadak was probably seized by the Caliph again and managed exclusively by the ruler of the time as his private property.\n\n==Fadak in literature==\nThe dispute over Fadak was narrated in various sources, some of which became almost legendary. Among these is the tale of the famed caliph of the [[One Thousand and One Nights|One thousand and one ''Nights'']] tales, [[Harun al Rashid]], narrated in the 16th-century work ''La\u1e6d\u0101\u2019if al-Taw\u0101\u2019if'' ''The Subtleties of People'', in which Harun is described as feeling regret over the denial of Fadak to Muhammad's family. Harun inquired about the boundaries of the oasis from a descendant of Fatima in order to return it to its rightful possessors. The descendant cautioned that after drawing the borders of the garden of Fadak, Harun would no longer want to relinquish it. Nevertheless, Harun pressed on. The descendant replied that the first boundary of Fadak was [[Aden]], the second [[Samarqand]], the third the [[Maghrib]], and the fourth the [[Armenia]]n Sea. These borders outlined virtually the entire empire of Harun. That Harun himself initiated the process of returning Fadak and was not pressed by Muhammad's descendants reveals that in the Shi\u2019i conception, worldly possessions are of little to no importance to Muhammad's family or to the authority of the Imams.<ref>Virani, Shafique N.

When asked by Muhammad, who the \"Dhul Qurba\" referred to, Gabriel replied \"Fatima\" and that by \"rights\" was meant \"Fadak\", upon which Muhammad called Fatima and presented Fadak to her.<ref>*[[Ruzatul Safa]] as quoted in [[Tashdheed-ul-Mathaeen]] page 102.</ref>\n\nBesides the above Quranic verses, there some authenticated references for this issue. For example, [[Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani|Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i]] writes in his [[Sirat al-Halbiya|Siratu'l-Halabiyya]], p.&nbsp;39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr about the fact that she was given the fadak as a gift by the prophet of Islam, as the witnesses were unavailable she was forced to allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in [[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]] of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]] of [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi|Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi]], [[Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah|Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa]] of [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar]] p.&nbsp;21, [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha]] of [[Izz al-Din ibn Hibatullah ibn Abi l-Hadid|Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali]] Vol 4, p.&nbsp;80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] again.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar-nights-sultan-al-waadhim-sayyid-muhammad-al-musawi-ash-shirazi/eighth-session-thursday#fadak-was-gift-not-legacy Peshawar Nights, Sultan al-Wa\u2019adhim As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Musawi ash-Shirazi]</ref>\n\n=== After the death of Muhammad ===\n[[Lesley Hazleton]] describes the dispute between [[Fatimah]] and [[Abu Bakr]] as follows: \u00ab[Fatimah] sent a message to Abu Bakr asking for her share of her father's estate -date palm orchards in the huge oases of Khaybar and Fadak to the north of Medina. His response left her dumbfounded. Muhammad's estate belonged to the community, not to any individual, Abu Bakr replied. It was part of the Muslim charitable trust to be administered by him as Caliph. [...] There was no denying the populist appeal of the message Abu Bakr sent by denying Fatima's claim: the House of Muhammad was the House of Islam, and all were equal within it.\u00bb<ref>After the Prophet: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam By Lesley Hazleton, pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nWhen [[Umar]] became Caliph, the value of the land of Fadak along with its dates was 50,000 dirhams.<ref name=\"Hadeed\"/> Ali again claimed Fatima's inheritance during Umar's era, but was denied with the same argument as in the time of Abu Bakr. Umar however, restored the estates in Medina to [[`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib]] and Ali, as representatives of Muhammad's clan, the [[Banu Hashim]]. \nDuring [[Uthman]]'s caliphate, [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hak\u00e2m]], who was his cousin, was made trustee of the Fadak.<ref>Wafa al Wafa (vol 3 p 1000), Tarikh Abu al-Fida (vol 1 p 168)</ref>\n\n=== Sunni view of Fadak ===\nAccording to Sunnis, Fadak was a piece of land, near Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by Muhammad. The Qur'an says: \u201cAnd that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.  -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur\u2019an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle. From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai as the head of the Islamic republic.<ref>http://www.muslimtents.com/shaufi/b16/b16_13.htm</ref>\n\nAccording to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations regarding this are weak. As far as the claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of the Quran, \"And give the relative his right\",<ref>Quran, Surah Isra, verse 26</ref> was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter as it was her right.\nBut, there are several famous Sunni scholars who specify that the revelation of 17:26<ref>[http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/17:26 17:26]</ref> is about Fadak transmission from the Prophet to Fatima, such as: Razi,<ref>[Razi in the book \"Aljrh and Altdyl\" vol. 1, p. 257]</ref> Suyuti,<ref name=\"Suyuti p. 158\">[Suyuti (Vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 5, pp.273_274)]</ref> Khwarizmi,<ref name=\"Suyuti p. 158\"/> Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi<ref>[Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi (vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 3, p. 767)]</ref> and so on.\n\nFatimah However Agreed and Was Satisfied With The Decision of Abu Bakr after He Came to Fatimah's House and Discussed The Matter With Ali and Fatima.\nDarqutni,Ameer ul Mu'mineen Fil Hadith reports a narration From Umme Hani in his Al ilal,\n                           \"Umme Hani Told Fatimah Told Abu Bakr Told That The Holy Prophet Peace Be Upon him said That We Prophets Don't have \n                                                 inheritors, instead What we leave is Charity for the Ummah\"\n                                                         <ref>Darqutni,Al ilal ,1:231:34</ref>\nReporting of Fatimah the Hadith on the Authority of Abu Bakr Proves That She Was Satisfied.\n\n=== Fadak under the Umayyads (661 &ndash; 750) ===\n[[Mu'awiyah]], the first [[Ummayad|Umayyad Caliph]] did not return Fadak to [[Fatimah]]'s descendants. This way was continued by later [[Ummayad|Umayyad Caliphs]] until [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] seized power.\nWhen [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]], known as [[Umar II]], became Caliph in 717 CE, the income from the property of Fadak was 40,000 dinars.<ref>[[Sunan Abu Dawud]], v3, p144, Dhikr Fa'y</ref> Fadak was returned to Fatima's descendants by an edict given by [[Umar II]],<ref>[[Wafa al-Wafa]], page 99</ref> but this decision was renounced by later caliphs.[[Umar II]]'s successor, [[Yazid II|Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik]] (known as [[Yazid II]]) overturned his decision, and Fadak was again made public trust. Fadak was then managed this way until the [[Ummayad Caliphate]] expired.\n\n=== Fadak under the Abbasids (750 &ndash; 1258) ===\nIn year 747 CE, a huge revolt against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] occurred. The Umayyad's were eventually defeated by the [[Abbasid]] army under the rule of [[As-Saffah|Abu Abbas Abdullah al-Saffah]] (see [[Battle of the Zab]]) in year 750. The last [[Umayyad]] Caliph, [[Marwan II]], was killed in a lesser battle a few months after the [[Battle of the Zab]], thus ending the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].\nHistorical accounts differs on what happened to Fadak under the early Abbasid caliphs. There is however consensus among [[Islamic scholar]]s that Fadak was granted to the descendants of Fatimah during [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s reign as Caliph (831-833 CE). Al-Ma\u2019mun even decreed this to be recorded in his ''(d\u012bw\u0101ns)''.  \nAl-Ma\u2019mun's successor,  [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (847-861) recaptured Fadak from the progeny of Fatimah, decreeing it to be used for the purposes initially outlined by Abu Bakr. [[Al-Muntasir]] (861-862), however, apparently maintained the decision of [[Al-Ma'mun]], thus allowing Fatimah's progeny to manage Fadak.<ref>As stated in Tarikh Yaqubi (2:199, 3:48), Wafa al Wafa vol 3 p 999-1000, Tarikh ul Khulafa, p 231-32</ref> \nWhat happened hereafter is uncertain, but Fadak was probably seized by the Caliph again and managed exclusively by the ruler of the time as his private property.\n\n==Fadak in literature==\nThe dispute over Fadak was narrated in various sources, some of which became almost legendary. Among these is the tale of the famed caliph of the [[One Thousand and One Nights|One thousand and one ''Nights'']] tales, [[Harun al Rashid]], narrated in the 16th-century work ''La\u1e6d\u0101\u2019if al-Taw\u0101\u2019if'' ''The Subtleties of People'', in which Harun is described as feeling regret over the denial of Fadak to Muhammad's family. Harun inquired about the boundaries of the oasis from a descendant of Fatima in order to return it to its rightful possessors. The descendant cautioned that after drawing the borders of the garden of Fadak, Harun would no longer want to relinquish it. Nevertheless, Harun pressed on. The descendant replied that the first boundary of Fadak was [[Aden]], the second [[Samarqand]], the third the [[Maghrib]], and the fourth the [[Armenia]]n Sea. These borders outlined virtually the entire empire of Harun. That Harun himself initiated the process of returning Fadak and was not pressed by Muhammad's descendants reveals that in the Shi\u2019i conception, worldly possessions are of little to no importance to Muhammad's family or to the authority of the Imams.<ref>Virani, Shafique N.

The goal of this organisation is to establish and foster relations between students across Europe and support them in their professional and personal development.\nAs of November 2016, the ESTIEM network counts over 8.000 members that are registered in 81 universities of 31 countries.\n\nESTIEM's has its seat in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of the network was created during the [[Austrian Institute of Economic Research|WIFO]] 1990 seminar that was held in [[Darmstadt]] in January 1990. During the mentioned meeting participants from [[Darmstadt]], [[Dresden]], [[Graz]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Karlsruhe]] decided to integrate a network of [[Industrial Engineering and Management|IEM]] Students and graduates to \"enhance communication and co-operation\". This network was called EAIM (European Association of Industrial Management). In November 1990 the statute of ESTIEM was signed in [[Berlin]] by representatives of 14 student groups from 6 countries. ESTIEM is an official student organisation registered in Eindhoven, since 1995.\n\n== Today ==\nAnnually, ESTIEM delivers over 150 European wide events to its membership of over 8.000 students. These events aim to support students in their personal and professional development by educating them in: [[Soft skills]], IEM [[Seminars]], [[Case competition|Case Study competitions]] and [[Entrepreneurship]]. ESTIEM publishes two Magazines<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.estiem.org/default.aspx?PageId=525 |title=ESTIEM Magazines}}</ref> annually that claim to provide insight into \"forward-looking topics\" in Industrial Engineering and Management, the print run is approximately 3000 copies.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:ESTIEM Structure.png|300px|thumbnail|left|Interconnected Structure of ESTIEM]]\nThe network consists of its Local Groups, which function as independent entities connected to IEM study programmes at universities over Europe. The purpose of the central level is to support the Local Groups in their activities.\n\n=== The central level ===\n\n* The '''Board of ESTIEM''' which is the core managing and responsible body of the organisation. It is constituted of six students who are being elected every spring.\n* '''Committees''', their task is to support the Board on operational tasks in specific areas of its responsibility.\n* '''Projects''' That are responsible to support Local Groups when organising an event and to provide services to students.\n\n== Council meetings ==\nThe decision-making body of the network is the General Assembly, which meets twice a year in autumn and in spring at the '''Council Meeting'''. Each university, represented by its so called \"local Group\", sends two student representatives.\n\n== Benefits for students ==\n\nESTIEM offers students opportunities to develop themselves, including seminars, case study competitions, summer academies and [[training]]. These activities are set in an intercultural context, where individuals may find that different mentalities challenges their way of thinking. Making friends and exploring Europe by participating in European wide events that encourages open-mindedness, paving the way for friendships and a network of future colleagues across borders.\n\n== Local groups ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The goal of this organisation is to establish and foster relations between students across Europe and support them in their professional and personal development.\nAs of November 2016, the ESTIEM network counts over 8.000 members that are registered in 81 universities of 31 countries.\n\nESTIEM's has its seat in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of the network was created during the [[Austrian Institute of Economic Research|WIFO]] 1990 seminar that was held in [[Darmstadt]] in January 1990. During the mentioned meeting participants from [[Darmstadt]], [[Dresden]], [[Graz]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Karlsruhe]] decided to integrate a network of [[Industrial Engineering and Management|IEM]] Students and graduates to \"enhance communication and co-operation\". This network was called EAIM (European Association of Industrial Management). In November 1990 the statute of ESTIEM was signed in [[Berlin]] by representatives of 14 student groups from 6 countries. ESTIEM is an official student organisation registered in Eindhoven, since 1995.\n\n== Today ==\nAnnually, ESTIEM delivers over 150 European wide events to its membership of over 8.000 students. These events aim to support students in their personal and professional development by educating them in: [[Soft skills]], IEM [[Seminars]], [[Case competition|Case Study competitions]] and [[Entrepreneurship]]. ESTIEM publishes two Magazines<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.estiem.org/default.aspx?PageId=525 |title=ESTIEM Magazines}}</ref> annually that claim to provide insight into \"forward-looking topics\" in Industrial Engineering and Management, the print run is approximately 3000 copies.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:ESTIEM Structure.png|300px|thumbnail|left|Interconnected Structure of ESTIEM]]\nThe network consists of its Local Groups, which function as independent entities connected to IEM study programmes at universities over Europe. The purpose of the central level is to support the Local Groups in their activities.\n\n=== The central level ===\n\n* The '''Board of ESTIEM''' which is the core managing and responsible body of the organisation. It is constituted of six students who are being elected every spring.\n* '''Committees''', their task is to support the Board on operational tasks in specific areas of its responsibility.\n* '''Projects''' That are responsible to support Local Groups when organising an event and to provide services to students.\n\n== Council meetings ==\nThe decision-making body of the network is the General Assembly, which meets twice a year in autumn and in spring at the '''Council Meeting'''. Each university, represented by its so called \"local Group\", sends two student representatives.\n\n== Benefits for students ==\n\nESTIEM offers students opportunities to develop themselves, including seminars, case study competitions, summer academies and [[training]]. These activities are set in an intercultural context, where individuals may find that different mentalities challenges their way of thinking. Making friends and exploring Europe by participating in European wide events that encourages open-mindedness, paving the way for friendships and a network of future colleagues across borders.\n\n== Local groups ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. While on loan to St Mirren during the [[2005\u201306 St Mirren F.C. season|2005\u201306]] season, Adam was part of the team that won both the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] and [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], playing in over thirty matches for the \"Saints\". Upon returning to Rangers at the end of the 2006 season, he became a regular under managers [[Paul Le Guen]] and [[Walter Smith]]. Adam was also part of the Rangers team that reached the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\nAfter falling out of favour at Rangers during [[2008\u201309 Rangers F.C. season|2008\u201309]], Adam was loaned out to English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The loan was made permanent at the start of the [[2009\u201310 Blackpool F.C. season|2009\u201310]] season, and Adam became an integral part of the Blackpool side, captaining the team to a [[2010 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-off victory]] over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] which resulted in their promotion to the [[Premier League]]. Adam shone in his first season in the [[Premier League]], his performances being recognised with a nomination for the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in April 2011. However, Blackpool were relegated and consequently he transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2011. After one season at [[Anfield]] Adam joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2012 for a fee of \u00a34&nbsp;million.
