It is the largest town of the former Province of Lower Silesia that lies west of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], east of which all German population was  [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expelled en mass]], and hence remains in Germany today. Thus it is both the most [[Silesia]]n town, in terms of character, and the largest in Germany today. The town combines Lusatian and Silesian traditions as well as German and [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] culture. G\u00f6rlitz has a rich architectural heritage.

[[Zgorzelec]] and Czech ''Zho\u0159elec'' have the same derivation. In the 13th century the village gradually became a town. Due to its location on the [[Via Regia]], an ancient and medieval trade route, the settlement prospered.\n\nIn the following centuries G\u00f6rlitz was a wealthy member of the [[Lusatian League]], which consisted of [[Bautzen]], G\u00f6rlitz, [[Kamenz]], [[Lauban]], [[L\u00f6bau]] and [[Zittau]]. In 1352 during the reign of [[Casimir the Great]], Lusatian German colonists from G\u00f6rlitz founded the town of [[Gorlice]] in southern Poland near [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\n[[File:Goerlitz 1575.jpg|thumb|left|G\u00f6rlitz in the 16th century]]\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] came to G\u00f6rlitz in the early 1520s and by the last half of the 16th century, it and the surrounding vicinity, became almost completely Lutheran.\n\nAfter suffering for years in the [[Thirty Years' War]], the region of Upper Lusatia (including G\u00f6rlitz) was ceded to the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in 1635. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] transferred the town from the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. G\u00f6rlitz was subsequently administered within the [[Province of Silesia]], and, after [[World War I]], the [[Province of Lower Silesia]], until 1945.\n\nNear the end of [[World War II]], German troops destroyed all bridges crossing the [[Lusatian Neisse]]. The redrawing of boundaries in 1945\u2014in particular the relocation of the German-Polish border to the present [[Oder-Neisse line]]\u2014divided the town. The right bank became part of Poland and was renamed ''[[Zgorzelec]]'' by the Polish communist government in 1948, while the main portion on the left bank remained part of Germany, now within the state of Saxony. When the [[East Germany|East German]] states were dissolved in 1952, G\u00f6rlitz became part of the [[Dresden (Bezirk)|Dresden District]], but the states were restored upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nOn 27 June 1994, the town became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of G\u00f6rlitz]], but it remains a Lutheran Protestant stronghold.\n\nIn 2002 [[Lake Berzdorf]], located south of G\u00f6rlitz, began to flood. The ''Altstadtbr\u00fccke'' (literally ''old town bridge'') between G\u00f6rlitz and sister city Zgorzelec was rebuilt between 2003 and 2004. It was officially opened on 20 October 2004. As soon as Poland signed the [[Schengen Agreement]] (20 December 2007), movement between the two banks of the river again became unrestricted, since border controls were eliminated. Indeed, users of the new pedestrian bridge are not told by any signs that they are leaving one country and entering another.\n\nWhilst the town was well preserved, it was notably grey and colourless under communist East German rule. Since reunification, and as of 2013, over 700 buildings have been renovated. It is a popular place to which the elderly of Germany retire, being quiet and relatively affordable by German standards. Its tourist potential is rapidly expanding, being very much an eastern counterpart to towns such as [[Heidelberg]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} In the case of G\u00f6rlitz, much of the funding for the renovations of the towns buildings comes from an anonymous donor, who, from 1995 onward, has sent an annual donation of over [[Euro|\u20ac]]500,000, totalling over \u20ac10,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/g%C3%B6rlitz-generous-donor/av-16763697|title=G\u00f6rlitz' Generous Donor|date=23 April 2013 |website=dw.com |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\n[[File:Goerlitz-Untermarkt 24 23 von Suedosten-20110627.jpg|thumb|G\u00f6rlitz, Untermarkt (2011)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P072003, G\u00f6rlitz, Untermarkt.jpg|thumb|G\u00f6rlitz, Untermarkt (1932)]]\nToday G\u00f6rlitz and Zgorzelec, two towns on opposite banks of the narrow river, get along well. Two bridges have been rebuilt, a bus line connects the German and Polish parts of the town, and there is a common urban management, with annual joint sessions of both town councils.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe town has a rich architectural heritage (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau). One example of this rich architectural heritage is the [[Sch\u00f6nhof (G\u00f6rlitz)|Sch\u00f6nhof]], which is one of the oldest civic Renaissance buildings in Germany. Another medieval heritage is a model of the [[Holy Sepulchre (G\u00f6rlitz)|Holy Sepulchre]]<small> ([[:de:Heiliges Grab (G\u00f6rlitz)|de]])</small> which was constructed in the late 15th century.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2006 the [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin city]] G\u00f6rlitz/Zgorzelec applied to be the [[European City of Culture]] 2010. It was hoped that the concept of Polish-German cooperation would be sufficient to convince the jury, but [[Essen]] won. G\u00f6rlitz was placed second. As a result of the campaign G\u00f6rlitz was renamed City of Culture in order to further German-Polish relations and to attract tourists from all over the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-research-project-offers-one-week-of-free-living/a-3641146|title=German Research Project Offers One Week of Free Living &#124; DW &#124; 14.09.2008|first=Deutsche|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM a|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs G\u00f6rlitz was part of Silesia from 1815 onward, it has a ''Silesian Museum'' dedicated to the region (''Schlesisches Museum zu G\u00f6rlitz'') and even holds a Silesian Music festival (''Schlesisches Musikfest''). In addition, G\u00f6rlitz is the seat of the Silesia Youth Group (''Schlesische Jugend''). There is also a newspaper in G\u00f6rlitz called the ''[[Lower Silesia]]n Kurier'' (''Niederschlesischer Kurier'').{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nG\u00f6rlitz is also the birthplace of the German version of [[nonpareils]], popularly known in Germany as ''liebesperlen'' ([[German language|German]]: ''love pearls''). Invented by confectioner Rudolf Hoinkis (1876\u20131944), the name derives from a conversation Hoinkis had with his wife, proclaiming his love for her like these \"pearls\", the nonpareil. Unsure of what to call the treat he invented, his wife suggested calling them love pearls, and the name stuck. The factory where he first manufactured the treat, founded in 1896, is now run by his great-grandson, Mathias.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/nonpareil-sweet-treat-from-g%C3%B6rlitz/av-19221474|title=Nonpareil - sweet treat from G\u00f6rlitz|date=28 April 2016|website=dw.com|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=1 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034145/http://www.dw.com/en/nonpareil-sweet-treat-from-g%C3%B6rlitz/av-19221474|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bahnhof G\u00f6rlitz.jpg|thumb|G\u00f6rlitz Main Railway Station]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[G\u00f6rlitz station]] is on the [[Berlin\u2013G\u00f6rlitz railway|Berlin \u2013 G\u00f6rlitz]] and the [[Dresden\u2013G\u00f6rlitz railway|Dresden \u2013 G\u00f6rlitz lines]] of [[Deutsche Bahn]].

Located in the region of [[Lusatia]] on the [[Lusatian Neisse]] River, it is the second largest town of Lusatia after [[Cottbus]], and the largest in [[Upper Lusatia]]. Seat of the [[G\u00f6rlitz (district)|district of G\u00f6rlitz]], Germany's easternmost district, its approximately 56,000 inhabitants also make G\u00f6rlitz the sixth largest town of the Free State of Saxony. It lies opposite the Polish town of [[Zgorzelec]], which was part of G\u00f6rlitz until 1945. While not [[Sorbian languages|Lusatiophone]] itself, the town lies just east of the Sorbian-speaking parts of Lusatia.\n\nFrom 1815 until 1918, G\u00f6rlitz belonged to the [[Province of Silesia]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and later to the [[Province of Lower Silesia]] in the [[Free State of Prussia]]. It is the largest town of the former Province of Lower Silesia that lies west of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], east of which all German population was  [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expelled en mass]], and hence remains in Germany today. Thus it is both the most [[Silesia]]n town, in terms of character, and the largest in Germany today. The town combines Lusatian and Silesian traditions as well as German and [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] culture. G\u00f6rlitz has a rich architectural heritage. Many movie-makers have used the various sites as locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/reise/kleine-fluchten/article206737371/Hier-dreht-sich-alles-um-das-Drehen.html|title=Hier dreht sich alles um das Drehen|first=Marlis|last=Heinz|work=morgenpost.de|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Landeskrone view from zgorzelec.JPG|thumb|The Landeskrone, literally \"land's crown\", the local mountain of G\u00f6rlitz, as seen from [[Zgorzelec]]]]\nAs a small [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] village named ''Gorelic'' in the region of [[Upper Lusatia]] in the [[March of Lusatia]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], it was temporarily conquered and held by the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] during [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]]'s invasion of [[Lusatia]] between 1002 and 1031, after which the region fell back to the March of Lusatia under the counts of the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Around 1072 the village was assigned to the [[duchy of Bohemia]]. The date of the town's foundation is unknown. However, ''Goreliz'' was first mentioned in a document from the King of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], and later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] in 1071. This document granted G\u00f6rlitz to the [[Diocese of Meissen]], then under Bishop Benno of [[Bishopric of Meissen|Meissen]]. Currently, this document can be found in the Saxony State Archives in [[Dresden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findcity.de/02826ca/?p=00000002|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070520015435/http://www.findcity.de/02826ca/?p=00000002|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 May 2007|title=Deutschlands St\u00e4dte, Gemeinden und Kreise online - FindCity|work=findcity.de|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref> The origin of the name G\u00f6rlitz is derived from the Slavic word for \"burned land\",<ref>\"Placenames of the World\" by Adrian Room, McFarland Pub. 2003 page 140</ref> referring to the technique used to clear land for settlement. [[Zgorzelec]] and Czech ''Zho\u0159elec'' have the same derivation. In the 13th century the village gradually became a town. Due to its location on the [[Via Regia]], an ancient and medieval trade route, the settlement prospered.\n\nIn the following centuries G\u00f6rlitz was a wealthy member of the [[Lusatian League]], which consisted of [[Bautzen]], G\u00f6rlitz, [[Kamenz]], [[Lauban]], [[L\u00f6bau]] and [[Zittau]]. In 1352 during the reign of [[Casimir the Great]], Lusatian German colonists from G\u00f6rlitz founded the town of [[Gorlice]] in southern Poland near [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\n[[File:Goerlitz 1575.jpg|thumb|left|G\u00f6rlitz in the 16th century]]\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] came to G\u00f6rlitz in the early 1520s and by the last half of the 16th century, it and the surrounding vicinity, became almost completely Lutheran.\n\nAfter suffering for years in the [[Thirty Years' War]], the region of Upper Lusatia (including G\u00f6rlitz) was ceded to the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in 1635. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] transferred the town from the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. G\u00f6rlitz was subsequently administered within the [[Province of Silesia]], and, after [[World War I]], the [[Province of Lower Silesia]], until 1945.\n\nNear the end of [[World War II]], German troops destroyed all bridges crossing the [[Lusatian Neisse]]. The redrawing of boundaries in 1945\u2014in particular the relocation of the German-Polish border to the present [[Oder-Neisse line]]\u2014divided the town. The right bank became part of Poland and was renamed ''[[Zgorzelec]]'' by the Polish communist government in 1948, while the main portion on the left bank remained part of Germany, now within the state of Saxony. When the [[East Germany|East German]] states were dissolved in 1952, G\u00f6rlitz became part of the [[Dresden (Bezirk)|Dresden District]], but the states were restored upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nOn 27 June 1994, the town became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of G\u00f6rlitz]], but it remains a Lutheran Protestant stronghold.\n\nIn 2002 [[Lake Berzdorf]], located south of G\u00f6rlitz, began to flood. The ''Altstadtbr\u00fccke'' (literally ''old town bridge'') between G\u00f6rlitz and sister city Zgorzelec was rebuilt between 2003 and 2004. It was officially opened on 20 October 2004. As soon as Poland signed the [[Schengen Agreement]] (20 December 2007), movement between the two banks of the river again became unrestricted, since border controls were eliminated. Indeed, users of the new pedestrian bridge are not told by any signs that they are leaving one country and entering another.\n\nWhilst the town was well preserved, it was notably grey and colourless under communist East German rule. Since reunification, and as of 2013, over 700 buildings have been renovated. It is a popular place to which the elderly of Germany retire, being quiet and relatively affordable by German standards. Its tourist potential is rapidly expanding, being very much an eastern counterpart to towns such as [[Heidelberg]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} In the case of G\u00f6rlitz, much of the funding for the renovations of the towns buildings comes from an anonymous donor, who, from 1995 onward, has sent an annual donation of over [[Euro|\u20ac]]500,000, totalling over \u20ac10,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/g%C3%B6rlitz-generous-donor/av-16763697|title=G\u00f6rlitz' Generous Donor|date=23 April 2013 |website=dw.com |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\n[[File:Goerlitz-Untermarkt 24 23 von Suedosten-20110627.jpg|thumb|G\u00f6rlitz, Untermarkt (2011)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P072003, G\u00f6rlitz, Untermarkt.jpg|thumb|G\u00f6rlitz, Untermarkt (1932)]]\nToday G\u00f6rlitz and Zgorzelec, two towns on opposite banks of the narrow river, get along well. Two bridges have been rebuilt, a bus line connects the German and Polish parts of the town, and there is a common urban management, with annual joint sessions of both town councils.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe town has a rich architectural heritage (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau). One example of this rich architectural heritage is the [[Sch\u00f6nhof (G\u00f6rlitz)|Sch\u00f6nhof]], which is one of the oldest civic Renaissance buildings in Germany. Another medieval heritage is a model of the [[Holy Sepulchre (G\u00f6rlitz)|Holy Sepulchre]]<small> ([[:de:Heiliges Grab (G\u00f6rlitz)|de]])</small> which was constructed in the late 15th century.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2006 the [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin city]] G\u00f6rlitz/Zgorzelec applied to be the [[European City of Culture]] 2010. It was hoped that the concept of Polish-German cooperation would be sufficient to convince the jury, but [[Essen]] won. G\u00f6rlitz was placed second. As a result of the campaign G\u00f6rlitz was renamed City of Culture in order to further German-Polish relations and to attract tourists from all over the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-research-project-offers-one-week-of-free-living/a-3641146|title=German Research Project Offers One Week of Free Living &#124; DW &#124; 14.09.2008|first=Deutsche|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM a|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAs G\u00f6rlitz was part of Silesia from 1815 onward, it has a ''Silesian Museum'' dedicated to the region (''Schlesisches Museum zu G\u00f6rlitz'') and even holds a Silesian Music festival (''Schlesisches Musikfest''). In addition, G\u00f6rlitz is the seat of the Silesia Youth Group (''Schlesische Jugend'').
