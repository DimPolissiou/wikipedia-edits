{"title_page": "Grand Slam (golf)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Grand Slam (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}\nThe '''Grand Slam''' in professional [[golf]] is winning all of golf's major championships in the same calendar year. Other variations include the '''Career Grand Slam''', winning all of the major tournaments within a player's career, or the '''non-calendar year Grand Slam''', also known as the '''Tiger Slam''', holding all major titles at the same time although not in the same year.\n\n==The Men's Grand Slam==\n[[File:BobbyJonesAge14.jpg|185px|thumb|upright|right|[[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who won the pre-Masters era Career Grand Slam once, and is the only golfer all-time to have won four majors in the same calendar year.]]\nThe Grand Slam in men's golf is an unofficial term for a golfer who wins all four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] in a calendar year.\n\nIn the modern era, the Grand Slam requires victories in the following tournaments in a single calendar year (listed in current playing order):\n# [[Masters Tournament]], held the week ending on the 2nd Sunday in April \u2013 hosted as an invitational by and played at [[Augusta National Golf Club]]\n# [[PGA Championship]] (also known as the \"United States PGA Championship\" or \"USPGA\"), held the week ending on the 3rd Sunday in May, one week before [[Memorial Day]] weekend \u2013 hosted by the [[PGA of America]] and played at various locations in the United States. Prior to 2019, it was held in mid-August, three weeks before [[Labor Day]] weekend.\n# [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], held the week ending on the 3rd Sunday in June \u2013 hosted by the [[USGA]] and played at various locations in the United States.\n# [[The Open Championship]] (\"The Open\", sometimes called \"the British Open\" outside the UK), held the week containing the 3rd Friday in July \u2013 hosted by [[The R&A]] and always played on a [[links course]] at one of several predetermined locations in the United Kingdom on a rota basis.\n\nPrior to the creation of the Masters Tournament, the national amateur championships of the U.S. and the UK were considered major championships. During that earlier era, the Grand Slam comprised consecutive victories at the [[United States Amateur Championship]], [[The Amateur Championship]] (British Amateur) along with the U.S. Open and the Open Championship. \n\nOnly [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] has ever completed a Grand Slam. No man has ever achieved a modern era Grand Slam. [[Tiger Woods]] won all four major events consecutively within a 365-day period, but his victories were spread over two calendar years (winning three events in 2000 and the Masters in 2001).  The term also refers to a former tour tournament, the [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]], an annual off-season tournament (that was cancelled after the 2014 tournament) contested by the winners of the four major championships.\n\nThe term ''Grand Slam'' was first applied to [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]' achievement of winning the four major golf events of [[1930 in sports|1930]]: [[The Open Championship]], the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], the [[U.S. Amateur]] and the [[The Amateur Championship|British Amateur]]. When Jones won all four, the sports world searched for ways to capture the magnitude of his accomplishment. Up to that time, there was no term for such a feat because no one had thought it possible. The ''Atlanta Journal''{{'}}s O. B. Keeler dubbed it the \"Grand Slam,\" borrowing a [[contract bridge|bridge]] term. George Trevor of the ''New York Sun'' wrote that Jones had \"stormed the impregnable quadrilateral of golf.\" Keeler would later write the words that would forever be linked to one of the greatest individual accomplishments in the history of sports:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis victory, the fourth major title in the same season and in the space of four months, had now and for all time entrenched Bobby Jones safely within the 'Impregnable Quadrilateral of Golf,' that granite fortress that he alone could take by escalade, and that others may attack in vain, forever.\n</blockquote>\n\nJones remains the only man to have achieved the Grand Slam, since before the creation of The Masters and the advent of the professional era, the amateur championships were considered major championships.\n[[Image:JackNicklaus.cropped.jpg|180px|thumb|upright|right|[[Jack Nicklaus]] won the Career Grand Slam three times]]\n[[File:Tiger Woods drives by Allison.jpg|180px|thumb|upright|right|[[Tiger Woods]] won the Career Grand Slam three times]]\nThe modern definition could not be applied until at least [[1934 in sports|1934]], when the Masters was founded, and still carried little weight in [[1953 in sports|1953]] when [[Ben Hogan]] won the [[1953 Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[1953 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and [[1953 Open Championship|Open Championship]].  That year, it was impossible to win all four as the [[1953 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] preceded and overlapped with the Open Championship; the PGA's 36-hole match play semifinals and finals near [[Detroit]] were the same days as the mandatory 36-hole qualifier at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]] in [[Scotland]] for the Open Championship; the only way to compete in both events was to lose an early match at the PGA.<!--and the state of transatlantic travel made completing the Grand Slam impossible.--> Hogan is the only player to have won the Masters, U.S. Open, and Open Championship in the same calendar year.\n\nIn 1960, Arnold Palmer won the [[1960 Masters Tournament|Masters]] in April and [[1960 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] in June. According to his autobiography, ''A Golfer's Life'', he and his friend Bob Drum (of the [[Pittsburgh Press]]), while on the trans-Atlantic flight to [[1960 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St Andrews]], came up with the idea that adding it and the [[1960 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] titles that July would constitute a modern Grand Slam. Drum spread the notion among the gathered media and it caught on.<ref>Cited by: {{Citation\n  | last = Newport\n  | first = John Paul\n  | title = Mr. O'Meara's Neighborhood\n  | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal\n  | pages = \n  | date = July 19, 2008\n  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121641207227465979?mod=hpp_us_inside_today }}</ref> [[1958 PGA Championship|Two years earlier]], the PGA had changed to [[stroke play]], and it started to be held two weeks after the Open Championship in 1960. Scheduling problems continued through the 1960s as the last two majors were held in successive weeks in July on five occasions. The PGA was played in August in [[1965 PGA Championship|1965]] but returned to July for the next three. With the formation of the Tournament Players Division in late 1968, now the [[PGA Tour]], the PGA Championship permanently moved to August in [[1969 PGA Championship|1969]], except for the [[1971 PGA Championship|1971]] edition, held in late February to avoid the summer heat of [[Florida]].\n\n[[Tiger Woods]] came closest to meeting the modern definition of golf's Grand Slam by holding all four modern major championships simultaneously \u2014 the [[2000 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[2000 Open Championship|Open Championship]], and [[2000 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] in [[2000 in sports|2000]] and the [[2001 in sports|2001]] [[2001 Masters Tournament|Masters]] \u2014 although not in the same calendar year.  This has been referred to as a ''Consecutive Grand Slam,'' ''Non-calendar year Grand Slam'' (derived [[Grand Slam (tennis)|from other sports with a four-major format]]), or, after the only player to achieve it in golf, a ''Tiger Slam''.  <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/masters/2005-04-12-woods-slam_x.htm |title=Tiger's Masters victory fuels new talk of calendar Slam |newspaper=USA Today |first=Tom |last=Spousta |date=April 13, 2005}}</ref> In fact, even before Woods accomplished this, there was much debate over the definition of \"Grand Slam.\" [[Fred Couples]] said, \"I don't know how I can put it more simply . . . if he wins all four, it's a Slam.\"{{cn|date=September 2018}}  As noted above, however, because there is no official definition, there is no definitive answer.\n\nOnly five golfers have won all four of golf's modern majors at any time during their careers, an achievement which is often referred to as a ''Career Grand Slam'': [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Ben Hogan]], [[Gary Player]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Tiger Woods]]. Woods and Nicklaus have won each of the four majors at least three times.\n\nA number of dominant players of their eras have failed to achieve the Career Grand Slam because of their inability to win a particular major. [[Sam Snead]] and [[Phil Mickelson]] (through 2018) failed to win a U.S. Open; [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], and [[Jordan Spieth]] (through 2019) failed to win a PGA Championship; [[Lee Trevino]] and [[Rory McIlroy]] (through 2019) failed to win The Masters; [[Byron Nelson]] and [[Raymond Floyd]] failed to win the Open Championship, at which the former competed only once. These shortcomings have been attributed to various factors: a particular major is ill-suited to a player's game (this was cited especially with regard to Trevino and The Masters); the player lacked the ability to fully adapt to that major; the player simply experienced bad luck (Mickelson finished second a record six times at the U.S. Open); or war had led to the cancellation of a major during the player's prime.\n\n===Career Grand Slam===\n[[File:Gene Sarazen.JPG|140px|thumb|upright|right|[[Gene Sarazen]] won a Career Grand Slam]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|Deceased golfer \u2020\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|Most overall \u2021\n|}\n\n====Majors/Amateurs====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player||Major<br>titles||Grand<br>Slams||style=\"width:220px\"|[[U.S. Amateur]]||style=\"width:180px\"|[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]||style=\"width:130px\"|[[The Open Championship|The Open]]||style=\"width:120px\"|[[The Amateur Championship|The Amateur]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] \u2020  ||align=center|'''13'''||align=center|'''1''': 1930||style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''5''':  1924, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930 \u2021||style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''4''': 1923, 1926, 1929, 1930 \u2021||'''3''': 1926, 1927, 1930 ||'''1''': 1930\n|}\n\n====Majors Grand Slam====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player||Major<br>titles||Career<br>Slams||[[Masters Tournament|Masters]]||[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]||[[The Open Championship|The Open]]||[[PGA Championship|PGA]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jack Nicklaus]] ||align=center style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|&nbsp; '''18''' \u2021||align=center style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|&nbsp; '''3''' \u2021|| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''6''': 1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986 \u2021|| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''4''': 1962, 1967, 1972, 1980 \u2021|| '''3''': 1966, 1970, 1978 || style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''5''': 1963, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980 \u2021\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tiger Woods]]||align=center|'''15'''||align=center style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|&nbsp; '''3''' \u2021||'''5''': 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2019||'''3''': 2000, 2002, 2008||'''3''': 2000, 2005, 2006||'''4''': 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Ben Hogan]] \u2020||align=center|'''9'''||align=center|'''1'''||'''2''': 1951, 1953||style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''4''': 1948, 1950, 1951, 1953 \u2021||'''1''': 1953 ||'''2''': 1946, 1948''\n|-\n|{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Gary Player]]||align=center|'''9'''||align=center|'''1'''||'''3''':  1961, 1974, 1978||'''1''': 1965||'''3''': 1959, 1968, 1974||'''2''': 1962, 1972 \n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gene Sarazen]] \u2020||align=center|'''7'''||align=center|'''1'''||'''1''': 1935||'''2''': 1922, 1932||'''1''': 1932||'''3''': 1922, 1923, 1933\n|}\n[[Image:Ben Hogan NYWTS.jpg|140px|thumb|upright|right|[[Ben Hogan]] won a Career Grand Slam]]\n[[Image:All Black.jpg|140px|thumb|upright|right|[[Gary Player]] won a Career Grand Slam]]\n\n=====Men missing a major=====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player||Major missing||Major titles\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Walter Hagen]] \u2020 '''^''' \u221e||[[Masters Tournament]]||align=center|11\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jim Barnes]] \u2020 \u221e||Masters Tournament||align=center|4\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lee Trevino]]||Masters Tournament||align=center|6\n|-\n|{{flagicon|NIR}} [[Rory McIlroy]]||Masters Tournament||align=center|4\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|SCO}}/{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tommy Armour]] \u2020 \u221e||Masters Tournament||align=center|3\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Snead]] \u2020||[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]||align=center|7\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Phil Mickelson]]||U.S. Open||align=center|5\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Byron Nelson]] \u2020||[[The Open Championship]]||align=center|5\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Raymond Floyd]]||The Open Championship||align=center|4\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]]||[[PGA Championship]]||align=center|8\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Arnold Palmer]] \u2020||PGA Championship||align=center|7\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jordan Spieth]]||[[PGA Championship]]||align=center|3\n|}\n'''^''' Hagen co-holds the all-time record of five PGA Championship victories, which he shares with Jack Nicklaus, but all of his occurred during match-play.<br>\n\u221e Barnes never got the chance to play in the Masters Tournament during his career, as it was established in 1934.

No woman has completed a four-major Grand Slam, but [[Babe Zaharias]] won all three majors contested in [[1950 in sports|1950]] and [[Sandra Haynie]] won both majors in [[1974 in sports|1974]].\n\nSeven women have completed the Career Grand Slam by winning four different majors. There are variations in the set of four tournaments involved as the players played in different eras, and the women's tournaments defined as \"majors\" have varied considerably over time in a way that has not been paralleled in the men's game. The seven are [[Pat Bradley (golfer)|Pat Bradley]], [[Juli Inkster]], [[Inbee Park]], [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]], [[Louise Suggs]], [[Karrie Webb]], and [[Mickey Wright]]. Webb is separately recognized by the LPGA as its only \"Super Career Grand Slam\" winner, as she is the only one of the group to have won five different tournaments recognized as majors.<!--If anyone can, please look up career grand slams by LET members-->\n\nAlthough other women's tours, notably the [[Ladies European Tour]] (LET) and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], recognize a different set of \"majors\", the [[LPGA|U.S. LPGA]] is so dominant in global women's golf that the phrase \"women's majors\", without further qualification, is almost universally considered as a reference to the U.S. LPGA majors.\n\nThe five current major championships are:\n# March/April\u2014The [[ANA Inspiration]] (week ending in the first Sunday of April)\u2014Founded by [[Dinah Shore]], it is most remembered for the winners taking a \"lake jump\" into the water surrounding the 18th green, also called the \"Green Jacket of the [[LPGA]]\" in reference to the ceremony held at the [[Masters Tournament]].

Unlike the men's Open Championship, neither the LGU nor The R&A has adopted a [[Links (golf)|links]]-only course policy, although the event has most commonly been held on links courses in the 21st century. [[2007 Women's British Open|2007]] marked the first time it was held at what is considered by many to be the greatest golf course in the world, and certainly the most historic, the [[Old Course at St Andrews]]. In 2009, it was moved to a date three weeks after the U.S. Women's Open. The 2012 edition was held in September to avoid conflict with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London; in 2013, it returned to its then-current July/August date; and in 2019, it was fixed to be the week after The Evian Championship.

Like the women's majors, the senior majors are not globally recognized. However, because the U.S.-based [[PGA Tour Champions]] overwhelmingly dominates worldwide senior golf, its roster of majors is by far the most widely recognized.\n\nUnlike the mainstream men's and women's (until 2013) Grand Slams, the senior version (as recognized by PGA Tour Champions) now contains five events, arguably making a senior Grand Slam a greater accomplishment than in mainstream men's golf.\n\nIn the current order of play, the five majors are:\n# [[The Tradition]] (ending on the third or fourth Sunday in May, depending on the calendar)\n# [[Senior PGA Championship]] (one week after The Tradition; ending the day before the U.S. holiday of [[Memorial Day]], observed on the last Monday of May)\n# [[Senior Players Championship]] (ending on the last Sunday in June or the first Sunday in July, depending on the calendar)\n# [[United States Senior Open|U.S. Senior Open]] (ending on the Sunday in July two weeks before The Senior Open Championship)\n# [[Senior Open Championship|The Senior Open Championship]] (ending on the last Sunday in July)\n\nThe Senior PGA is by far the oldest of the senior majors, having been founded in 1937, decades before the establishment of PGA Tour Champions (as the Senior PGA Tour) in [[1980 Senior PGA Tour|1980]]. The other events were all founded in the 1980s\u2014the U.S. Senior Open in 1980, the Senior Players Championship in [[1983 Senior PGA Tour|1983]], The Senior Open in 1987, and The Tradition in [[1989 Senior PGA Tour|1989]]. This era saw senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as [[Arnold Palmer]] and [[Gary Player]], reached their fifties. The Senior Open, however, was not recognized as a U.S. senior major until [[2003 Champions Tour|2003]].\n\nThe stability of the majors in senior golf falls somewhere between mainstream men's golf and the LPGA:\n* The roster of mainstream men's majors has not changed since the concept of the professional \"Grand Slam\" was generally recognized. The number of tournaments recognized by the LPGA as majors, as well as the identity of these events, has varied considerably over the decades. Two tournaments that were once considered as LPGA majors no longer exist, and a third lost its major status but survives as a regular tour event. In senior golf, the number of majors has changed over the years, but always by the addition of a new major.\n* In terms of in-season scheduling, the senior majors have been much less stable than those of mainstream men's golf or the LPGA, especially in recent years. With the exception of a one-off staging of the PGA Championship in February [[1971 PGA Championship|1971]], the mainstream majors have been held in the same order, and in almost exactly the same weeks of the year, since 1969. In women's golf, the scheduling of the majors has stabilized in recent years, with occasional minor changes of dates but no change of order. However, in senior golf, the order of the majors has changed five times since 2006. The Senior Players Championship, held in July in 2006, moved to October in 2007, August in 2011, and to late June/early July in 2012. The Tradition, previously held in late August, moved to early May in 2011, mid-June in 2012, and mid-May in 2013. The U.S. Senior Open moved from mid-July to August in 2008; it returned to mid-July in 2012. The Senior PGA Championship and The Senior Open have retained their dates (respectively late May and late July) throughout this period.\n\nNo man has ever won all of the senior majors contested in a year, even in the period between 1980 and 1982 when only two senior majors existed. [[Bernhard Langer]] is the only man to have won all five of the current senior majors in his career, having completed the career Slam by winning both the Senior PGA Championship and Senior Open Championship in 2017. [[Miller Barber]] won both of the 1980-1982 senior majors, the Senior PGA and U.S. Senior Open, during that time span, and won the inaugural Senior Players Championship in 1983. Those three tournaments would be the only senior majors until The Tradition was first played in 1989. Prior to the founding of The Tradition, Palmer and Player also completed that era's Career Senior Grand Slam. However, neither Barber, Palmer, nor Player would ever win The Tradition.\n\n[[Jack Nicklaus]] is the only other player to have completed any era's Career Senior Grand Slam, doing so in his first two years on the Senior Tour. In his first year of eligibility in [[1990 Senior PGA Tour|1990]], he won The Tradition and the Senior Players Championship. [[1991 Senior PGA Tour|The next year]], he defended his Tradition title and went on to win the Senior PGA and U.S. Senior Open. However, he failed to defend his Senior Players title and thus missed out on a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\nLanger and Nicklaus are the only players to have won four or more different senior majors in their careers. Although Nicklaus never won The Senior Open, that event was not recognized as a U.S. senior major until 2003, which was also the only year he played the event. Player won The Senior Open three times before 2003, when it was considered a major by the [[European Senior Tour]] but not the circuit now known as PGA Tour Champions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Men's major professional golf championships}}\n* [[Men's major golf championships]]\n* [[Women's major golf championships]]\n* [[Chronological list of men's major golf champions]]\n* [[List of men's major championships winning golfers]]\n* [[Triple Crown of Golf]]\n* [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]] - an annual off-season tournament contested by the winners of the four men's major championships\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Men\u2019s Career Grand Slam Champion golfers}}\n{{Women's Career Grand Slam Champion Golfers}}\n{{Footer MensMajors}}\n{{Footer WomensMajors}}\n{{Golf}}\n\n[[Category:Golf terminology]]\n[[Category:Golf records and rankings]]\n[[Category:Men's major golf championships|*Z]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Grand Slam (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}\nThe '''Grand Slam''' in professional [[golf]] is winning all of golf's major championships in the same calendar year.

Prior to 2019, it was held in mid-August, three weeks before [[Labor Day]] weekend.\n# [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], held the week ending on the 3rd Sunday in June - hosted by the [[USGA]] and played at various locations in the United States.\n# [[The Open Championship]] (\"The Open\", sometimes called \"the British Open\" outside the UK), held the week containing the 3rd Friday in July - hosted by [[The R&A]] and always played on a [[links course]] at one of several predetermined locations in the United Kingdom on a rota basis.\n\nPrior to the creation of the Masters Tournament, the national amateur championships of the U.S. and the UK were considered major championships. During that earlier era, the Grand Slam comprised consecutive victories at the [[United States Amateur Championship]], [[The Amateur Championship]] (British Amateur) along with the U.S. Open and the Open Championship. \n\nOnly [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] has ever completed a Grand Slam. No man has ever achieved a modern era Grand Slam. [[Tiger Woods]] won all four major events consecutively within a 365-day period, but his victories were spread over two calendar years (winning three events in 2000 and the Masters in 2001).  The term also refers to a former tour tournament, the [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]], an annual off-season tournament (that was cancelled after the 2014 tournament) contested by the winners of the four major championships.\n\nThe term ''Grand Slam'' was first applied to [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]' achievement of winning the four major golf events of [[1930 in sports|1930]]: [[The Open Championship]], the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], the [[U.S. Amateur]] and the [[The Amateur Championship|British Amateur]]. When Jones won all four, the sports world searched for ways to capture the magnitude of his accomplishment. Up to that time, there was no term for such a feat because no one had thought it possible. The ''Atlanta Journal''{{'}}s O. B. Keeler dubbed it the \"Grand Slam,\" borrowing a [[contract bridge|bridge]] term. George Trevor of the ''New York Sun'' wrote that Jones had \"stormed the impregnable quadrilateral of golf.\" Keeler would later write the words that would forever be linked to one of the greatest individual accomplishments in the history of sports:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis victory, the fourth major title in the same season and in the space of four months, had now and for all time entrenched Bobby Jones safely within the 'Impregnable Quadrilateral of Golf,' that granite fortress that he alone could take by escalade, and that others may attack in vain, forever.\n</blockquote>\n\nJones remains the only man to have achieved the Grand Slam, since before the creation of The Masters and the advent of the professional era, the amateur championships were considered major championships.\n[[Image:JackNicklaus.cropped.jpg|180px|thumb|upright|right|[[Jack Nicklaus]] won the Career Grand Slam three times]]\n[[File:Tiger Woods drives by Allison.jpg|180px|thumb|upright|right|[[Tiger Woods]] won the Career Grand Slam three times]]\nThe modern definition could not be applied until at least [[1934 in sports|1934]], when the Masters was founded, and still carried little weight in [[1953 in sports|1953]] when [[Ben Hogan]] won the [[1953 Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[1953 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and [[1953 Open Championship|Open Championship]].  That year, it was impossible to win all four as the [[1953 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] preceded and overlapped with the Open Championship; the PGA's 36-hole match play semifinals and finals near [[Detroit]] were the same days as the mandatory 36-hole qualifier at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]] in [[Scotland]] for the Open Championship; the only way to compete in both events was to lose an early match at the PGA.<!--and the state of transatlantic travel made completing the Grand Slam impossible.--> Hogan is the only player to have won the Masters, U.S. Open, and Open Championship in the same calendar year.\n\nIn 1960, Arnold Palmer won the [[1960 Masters Tournament|Masters]] in April and [[1960 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] in June. According to his autobiography, ''A Golfer's Life'', he and his friend Bob Drum (of the [[Pittsburgh Press]]), while on the trans-Atlantic flight to [[1960 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St Andrews]], came up with the idea that adding it and the [[1960 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] titles that July would constitute a modern Grand Slam.

Scheduling problems continued through the 1960s as the last two majors were held in successive weeks in July on five occasions. The PGA was played in August in [[1965 PGA Championship|1965]] but returned to July for the next three. With the formation of the Tournament Players Division in late 1968, now the [[PGA Tour]], the PGA Championship permanently moved to August in [[1969 PGA Championship|1969]], except for the [[1971 PGA Championship|1971]] edition, held in late February to avoid the summer heat of [[Florida]].\n\n[[Tiger Woods]] came closest to meeting the modern definition of golf's Grand Slam by holding all four modern major championships simultaneously \u2014 the [[2000 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[2000 Open Championship|Open Championship]], and [[2000 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] in [[2000 in sports|2000]] and the [[2001 in sports|2001]] [[2001 Masters Tournament|Masters]] \u2014 although not in the same calendar year.  This has been referred to as a ''Consecutive Grand Slam,'' ''Non-calendar year Grand Slam'' (derived [[Grand Slam (tennis)|from other sports with a four-major format]]), or, after the only player to achieve it in golf, a ''Tiger Slam''.  <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/masters/2005-04-12-woods-slam_x.htm |title=Tiger's Masters victory fuels new talk of calendar Slam |newspaper=USA Today |first=Tom |last=Spousta |date=April 13, 2005}}</ref> In fact, even before Woods accomplished this, there was much debate over the definition of \"Grand Slam.\" [[Fred Couples]] said, \"I don't know how I can put it more simply . . . if he wins all four, it's a Slam.\"{{cn|date=September 2018}}  As noted above, however, because there is no official definition, there is no definitive answer.\n\nOnly five golfers have won all four of golf's modern majors at any time during their careers, an achievement which is often referred to as a ''Career Grand Slam'': [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Ben Hogan]], [[Gary Player]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Tiger Woods]]. Woods and Nicklaus have won each of the four majors at least three times.\n\nA number of dominant players of their eras have failed to achieve the Career Grand Slam because of their inability to win a particular major. [[Sam Snead]] and [[Phil Mickelson]] (through 2018) failed to win a U.S. Open; [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], and [[Jordan Spieth]] (through 2019) failed to win a PGA Championship; [[Lee Trevino]] and [[Rory McIlroy]] (through 2019) failed to win The Masters; [[Byron Nelson]] and [[Raymond Floyd]] failed to win the Open Championship, at which the former competed only once. These shortcomings have been attributed to various factors: a particular major is ill-suited to a player's game (this was cited especially with regard to Trevino and The Masters); the player lacked the ability to fully adapt to that major; the player simply experienced bad luck (Mickelson finished second a record six times at the U.S. Open); or war had led to the cancellation of a major during the player's prime.\n\n===Career Grand Slam===\n[[File:Gene Sarazen.JPG|140px|thumb|upright|right|[[Gene Sarazen]] won a Career Grand Slam]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|Deceased golfer \u2020\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|Most overall \u2021\n|}\n\n====Majors/Amateurs====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player||Major<br>titles||Grand<br>Slams||style=\"width:220px\"|[[U.S. Amateur]]||style=\"width:180px\"|[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]||style=\"width:130px\"|[[The Open Championship|The Open]]||style=\"width:120px\"|[[The Amateur Championship|The Amateur]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] \u2020  ||align=center|'''13'''||align=center|'''1''': 1930||style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''5''':  1924, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930 \u2021||style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''4''': 1923, 1926, 1929, 1930 \u2021||'''3''': 1926, 1927, 1930 ||'''1''': 1930\n|}\n\n====Majors Grand Slam====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player||Major<br>titles||Career<br>Slams||[[Masters Tournament|Masters]]||[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]||[[The Open Championship|The Open]]||[[PGA Championship|PGA]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jack Nicklaus]] ||align=center style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|&nbsp; '''18''' \u2021||align=center style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|&nbsp; '''3''' \u2021|| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''6''': 1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986 \u2021|| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''4''': 1962, 1967, 1972, 1980 \u2021|| '''3''': 1966, 1970, 1978 || style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''5''': 1963, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980 \u2021\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tiger Woods]]||align=center|'''15'''||align=center style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|&nbsp; '''3''' \u2021||'''5''': 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2019||'''3''': 2000, 2002, 2008||'''3''': 2000, 2005, 2006||'''4''': 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Ben Hogan]] \u2020||align=center|'''9'''||align=center|'''1'''||'''2''': 1951, 1953||style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|'''4''': 1948, 1950, 1951, 1953 \u2021||'''1''': 1953 ||'''2''': 1946, 1948''\n|-\n|{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Gary Player]]||align=center|'''9'''||align=center|'''1'''||'''3''':  1961, 1974, 1978||'''1''': 1965||'''3''': 1959, 1968, 1974||'''2''': 1962, 1972 \n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gene Sarazen]] \u2020||align=center|'''7'''||align=center|'''1'''||'''1''': 1935||'''2''': 1922, 1932||'''1''': 1932||'''3''': 1922, 1923, 1933\n|}\n[[Image:Ben Hogan NYWTS.jpg|140px|thumb|upright|right|[[Ben Hogan]] won a Career Grand Slam]]\n[[Image:All Black.jpg|140px|thumb|upright|right|[[Gary Player]] won a Career Grand Slam]]\n\n=====Men missing a major=====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player||Major missing||Major titles\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Walter Hagen]] \u2020 '''^''' \u221e||[[Masters Tournament]]||align=center|11\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jim Barnes]] \u2020 \u221e||Masters Tournament||align=center|4\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lee Trevino]]||Masters Tournament||align=center|6\n|-\n|{{flagicon|NIR}} [[Rory McIlroy]]||Masters Tournament||align=center|4\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|SCO}}/{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tommy Armour]] \u2020 \u221e||Masters Tournament||align=center|3\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Snead]] \u2020||[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]||align=center|7\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Phil Mickelson]]||U.S. Open||align=center|5\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Byron Nelson]] \u2020||[[The Open Championship]]||align=center|5\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Raymond Floyd]]||The Open Championship||align=center|4\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]]||[[PGA Championship]]||align=center|8\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Arnold Palmer]] \u2020||PGA Championship||align=center|7\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jordan Spieth]]||[[PGA Championship]]||align=center|3\n|}\n'''^''' Hagen co-holds the all-time record of five PGA Championship victories, which he shares with Jack Nicklaus, but all of his occurred during match-play.<br>\n\u221e Barnes never got the chance to play in the Masters Tournament during his career, as it was established in 1934.

No woman has completed a four-major Grand Slam, but [[Babe Zaharias]] won all three majors contested in [[1950 in sports|1950]] and [[Sandra Haynie]] won both majors in [[1974 in sports|1974]].\n\nSeven women have completed the Career Grand Slam by winning four different majors. There are variations in the set of four tournaments involved as the players played in different eras, and the women's tournaments defined as \"majors\" have varied considerably over time in a way that has not been paralleled in the men's game. The seven are [[Pat Bradley (golfer)|Pat Bradley]], [[Juli Inkster]], [[Inbee Park]], [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]], [[Louise Suggs]], [[Karrie Webb]], and [[Mickey Wright]]. Webb is separately recognized by the LPGA as its only \"Super Career Grand Slam\" winner, as she is the only one of the group to have won five different tournaments recognized as majors.<!--If anyone can, please look up career grand slams by LET members-->\n\nAlthough other women's tours, notably the [[Ladies European Tour]] (LET) and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], recognize a different set of \"majors\", the [[LPGA|U.S. LPGA]] is so dominant in global women's golf that the phrase \"women's majors\", without further qualification, is almost universally considered as a reference to the U.S. LPGA majors.\n\nThe five current major championships are:\n# March/April\u2014The [[ANA Inspiration]] (week ending in the first Sunday of April)\u2014Founded by [[Dinah Shore]], it is most remembered for the winners taking a \"lake jump\" into the water surrounding the 18th green, also called the \"Green Jacket of the [[LPGA]]\" in reference to the ceremony held at the [[Masters Tournament]].

[[2007 Women's British Open|2007]] marked the first time it was held at what is considered by many to be the greatest golf course in the world, and certainly the most historic, the [[Old Course at St Andrews]]. In 2009, it was moved to a date three weeks after the U.S. Women's Open. The 2012 edition was held in September to avoid conflict with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London; in 2013, it returned to its then-current July/August date; and in 2019, it was fixed to be the week after The Evian Championship.

Like the women's majors, the senior majors are not globally recognized. However, because the U.S.-based [[PGA Tour Champions]] overwhelmingly dominates worldwide senior golf, its roster of majors is by far the most widely recognized.\n\nUnlike the mainstream men's and women's (until 2013) Grand Slams, the senior version (as recognized by PGA Tour Champions) now contains five events, arguably making a senior Grand Slam a greater accomplishment than in mainstream men's golf.\n\nIn the current order of play, the five majors are:\n# [[The Tradition]] (ending on the third or fourth Sunday in May, depending on the calendar)\n# [[Senior PGA Championship]] (one week after The Tradition; ending the day before the U.S. holiday of [[Memorial Day]], observed on the last Monday of May)\n# [[Senior Players Championship]] (ending on the last Sunday in June or the first Sunday in July, depending on the calendar)\n# [[United States Senior Open|U.S. Senior Open]] (ending on the Sunday in July two weeks before The Senior Open Championship)\n# [[Senior Open Championship|The Senior Open Championship]] (ending on the last Sunday in July)\n\nThe Senior PGA is by far the oldest of the senior majors, having been founded in 1937, decades before the establishment of PGA Tour Champions (as the Senior PGA Tour) in [[1980 Senior PGA Tour|1980]]. The other events were all founded in the 1980s\u2014the U.S. Senior Open in 1980, the Senior Players Championship in [[1983 Senior PGA Tour|1983]], The Senior Open in 1987, and The Tradition in [[1989 Senior PGA Tour|1989]]. This era saw senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as [[Arnold Palmer]] and [[Gary Player]], reached their fifties. The Senior Open, however, was not recognized as a U.S. senior major until [[2003 Champions Tour|2003]].\n\nThe stability of the majors in senior golf falls somewhere between mainstream men's golf and the LPGA:\n* The roster of mainstream men's majors has not changed since the concept of the professional \"Grand Slam\" was generally recognized. The number of tournaments recognized by the LPGA as majors, as well as the identity of these events, has varied considerably over the decades. Two tournaments that were once considered as LPGA majors no longer exist, and a third lost its major status but survives as a regular tour event. In senior golf, the number of majors has changed over the years, but always by the addition of a new major.\n* In terms of in-season scheduling, the senior majors have been much less stable than those of mainstream men's golf or the LPGA, especially in recent years. With the exception of a one-off staging of the PGA Championship in February [[1971 PGA Championship|1971]], the mainstream majors have been held in the same order, and in almost exactly the same weeks of the year, since 1969. In women's golf, the scheduling of the majors has stabilized in recent years, with occasional minor changes of dates but no change of order. However, in senior golf, the order of the majors has changed five times since 2006. The Senior Players Championship, held in July in 2006, moved to October in 2007, August in 2011, and to late June/early July in 2012. The Tradition, previously held in late August, moved to early May in 2011, mid-June in 2012, and mid-May in 2013. The U.S. Senior Open moved from mid-July to August in 2008; it returned to mid-July in 2012. The Senior PGA Championship and The Senior Open have retained their dates (respectively late May and late July) throughout this period.\n\nNo man has ever won all of the senior majors contested in a year, even in the period between 1980 and 1982 when only two senior majors existed. [[Bernhard Langer]] is the only man to have won all five of the current senior majors in his career, having completed the career Slam by winning both the Senior PGA Championship and Senior Open Championship in 2017. [[Miller Barber]] won both of the 1980-1982 senior majors, the Senior PGA and U.S. Senior Open, during that time span, and won the inaugural Senior Players Championship in 1983. Those three tournaments would be the only senior majors until The Tradition was first played in 1989. Prior to the founding of The Tradition, Palmer and Player also completed that era's Career Senior Grand Slam. However, neither Barber, Palmer, nor Player would ever win The Tradition.\n\n[[Jack Nicklaus]] is the only other player to have completed any era's Career Senior Grand Slam, doing so in his first two years on the Senior Tour. In his first year of eligibility in [[1990 Senior PGA Tour|1990]], he won The Tradition and the Senior Players Championship. [[1991 Senior PGA Tour|The next year]], he defended his Tradition title and went on to win the Senior PGA and U.S. Senior Open. However, he failed to defend his Senior Players title and thus missed out on a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\nLanger and Nicklaus are the only players to have won four or more different senior majors in their careers. Although Nicklaus never won The Senior Open, that event was not recognized as a U.S. senior major until 2003, which was also the only year he played the event. Player won The Senior Open three times before 2003, when it was considered a major by the [[European Senior Tour]] but not the circuit now known as PGA Tour Champions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Men's major professional golf championships}}\n* [[Men's major golf championships]]\n* [[Women's major golf championships]]\n* [[Chronological list of men's major golf champions]]\n* [[List of men's major championships winning golfers]]\n* [[Triple Crown of Golf]]\n* [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]] - an annual off-season tournament contested by the winners of the four men's major championships\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Men\u2019s Career Grand Slam Champion golfers}}\n{{Women's Career Grand Slam Champion Golfers}}\n{{Footer MensMajors}}\n{{Footer WomensMajors}}\n{{Golf}}\n\n[[Category:Golf terminology]]\n[[Category:Golf records and rankings]]\n[[Category:Men's major golf championships|*Z]]\n", "name_user": "Wjemather", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Men's Grand Slam:mos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(golf)"}

Academy, a martial arts school located in Sydney, Australia teaching [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]], [[Muay Thai]], [[kickboxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]] and [[hot yoga]]. Kings Academy was established in 2017. \n\nPrior to being known as Kings Academy, from 2002 till 2017 Elvis Sinosic and Anthony Perosh both held the title of \"Chief Instructor\" together at SPMA (Sinosic/Perosh Martial Arts) which was located in two different locations in Sydney. Both Instructors decided to open their Individual Gyms after they agreed that one instructor should be at one location to pay closer attention to their students.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.elvissinosic.com}}\n* {{Sherdog}}\n* {{UFC|Elvis-Sinosic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sinosic, Elvis}}\n[[Category:Australian male mixed martial artists]]\n[[Category:Light heavyweight mixed martial artists]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Fighting Championship male fighters]]\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Australian practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu]]\n[[Category:Australian male taekwondo practitioners]]\n[[Category:Australian capoeira practitioners]]\n[[Category:Australian jujutsuka]]\n[[Category:Australian Muay Thai practitioners]]\n[[Category:Australian male sport wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Australian submission wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Silat practitioners]]\n[[Category:Pankration practitioners]]\n[[Category:Australian people of Croatian descent]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Canberra]]\n", "name_user": "HistoryFightFan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Sinosic"}
