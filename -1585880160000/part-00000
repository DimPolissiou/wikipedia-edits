The Canary, determined to force Jimmy to marry her so she can join the social elite, threatens to reveal that Jimmy was embezzling from his father. She turns down the elder Spotswoode's bribe to leave Jimmy alone. She telephones two men she has been blackmailing, Cleaver and Mannix, and demands one final generous gift from each of them by the next day. She makes the same request of \"creepy\" admirer Dr. Lindquist. Her ex-husband Tony Sheel eavesdrops and wants half, but she refuses to give him anything, even after he hits her. Cleaver, Mannix and Lindquist are all shown lurking about her apartment building late that night.\n\nSpotswoode visits her at her apartment around midnight, but cannot get her to change her mind. After he reaches the lobby of her building, he and another person hear screams from her place. They knock on the door, but she assures them that she is fine.\n\nThe Canary is found strangled the next day. The coroner places the time of death around midnight. District Attorney Markham investigates, aided by Philo Vance (a close friend of Charles Spotswoode) and Police Sergeant Heath. After all the suspects are brought in for questioning, Vance asks Markham to keep them waiting for a few hours. Markham agrees. Vance subtly maneuvers Cleaver, Mannix, Lindquist and the two Spotswoodes into playing [[poker]] to pass the time so he can observe their personality traits. Only one shows the daring, imagination and discipline required for the crime; that man bluffs Vance, betting everything with just a pair of deuces. The suspects are then released.\n\nSheel, who witnessed the murder while hiding in the closet, sends the killer several blackmail letters. He too is strangled. A pen found at the scene has Jimmy's name on it, so Heath arrests him for the murder. Jimmy then confesses to both murders, but Vance knows better.\n\nHe telephones Charles Spotswoode with the news and suggests they meet in an hour. Spotswoode speeds to the city from his country estate to confess, but his chauffeur makes a fatal mistake by trying to beat a train to a crossing, and Spotswoode is killed. Now Vance has to show how Charles murdered the Canary in order to free Jimmy. He is able to prove that the Canary was dead before Spotswoode left her apartment that night. Spotswoode had made a recording (Vance speculates it was Spotswoode himself pretending to be the woman) to fool a stuttering witness into believing the Canary was alive after her death. The recording is found in the apartment, and Jimmy is released.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[William Powell]] as Philo Vance\n*[[James Hall (actor)|James Hall]] as Jimmy Spotswoode \n*[[Louise Brooks]] as Margaret Odell (the Canary) \n*[[Jean Arthur]] as Alyce LaFosse \n*[[Charles Willis Lane|Charles Lane]] as Charles Spotswoode \n*[[Eugene Pallette]] as Sgt.

Louise Brooks' refusal to cooperate in the sound version had a major impact on her career.\n\nAfter filming the silent version, Brooks left for Germany to make two films for director [[G. W. Pabst]]. Her option with [[Paramount Pictures]] was up, and since the studio would not give her a raise, she saw no reason to remain in Hollywood. Months later, Paramount decided to re-shoot some scenes of ''Canary'' with recorded dialogue. The studio cabled Brooks in Berlin, demanding that she return to record her lines. She refused, taking the position that she no longer had an obligation to Paramount. Under the purported threat that she would never work in Hollywood again after such open defiance, she bluntly replied, \"Who wants to work in Hollywood?\"\n\nParamount spent considerable money{{cn|date = October 2019}} to hire actress [[Margaret Livingston]] (the \"Woman from the City\" in [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'') to dub the dialogue for Brooks where possible, as well as to re-shoot some scenes, with Livingston seen only in profile or from behind. When Brooks found herself back in Hollywood, she was unable to get good roles. Though her time as a star was over, her battle with studio moguls helped add to her eventual legend.\n\n==Accolades==\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]:\n** [[Philo Vance]] \u2013 Nominated Hero<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0019745|The Canary Murder Case}}\n* {{tcmdb title|70163|The Canary Murder Case}}\n* {{Amg title|86550|The Canary Murder Case}}\n*{{Internet Archive film | THEVOICEFROMTHEGRAVEVideoQualityUpgrade | The Canary Murder Case }}\n\n{{Frank Tuttle}}\n{{Malcolm St. Clair}}\n\n{{1920s-US-film-stub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canary Murder Case}}\n[[Category:1929 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American crime films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on mystery novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Malcolm St. Clair]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Frank Tuttle]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Transitional sound films]]\n[[Category:1920s mystery films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1929 film by Frank Tuttle, Malcolm St. Clair}}\n{{Infobox film\n|name           = The Canary Murder Case \n|image          = Canary Murder Case poster.jpg\n|image_size     =\n|caption        = theatrical poster\n|director       = [[Malcolm St. Clair (filmmaker)|Malcolm St. Clair]]<br>[[Frank Tuttle]] (added sound scenes)\n|writer         = [[S.

Harvey \n*[[Margaret Livingston]] as Margaret Odell (voice)\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Canary Murder Case (1929) 1.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Louise Brooks in ''The Canary Murder Case'']]\nThis film was initially made as a silent picture, then reworked as a sound film. Louise Brooks' refusal to cooperate in the sound version had a major impact on her career.\n\nAfter filming the silent version, Brooks left for Germany to make two films for director [[G. W. Pabst]]. Her option with [[Paramount Pictures]] was up, and since the studio would not give her a raise, she saw no reason to remain in Hollywood. Months later, Paramount decided to re-shoot some scenes of ''Canary'' with recorded dialogue. The studio cabled Brooks in Berlin, demanding that she return to record her lines. She refused, taking the position that she no longer had an obligation to Paramount. Under the purported threat that she would never work in Hollywood again after such open defiance, she bluntly replied, \"Who wants to work in Hollywood?\"\n\nParamount spent considerable money{{cn|date = October 2019}} to hire actress [[Margaret Livingston]] (the \"Woman from the City\" in [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'') to dub the dialogue for Brooks where possible, as well as to re-shoot some scenes, with Livingston seen only in profile or from behind. When Brooks found herself back in Hollywood, she was unable to get good roles. Though her time as a star was over, her battle with studio moguls helped add to her eventual legend.\n\n==Accolades==\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]:\n** [[Philo Vance]] \u2013 Nominated Hero<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0019745|The Canary Murder Case}}\n* {{tcmdb title|70163|The Canary Murder Case}}\n* {{Amg title|86550|The Canary Murder Case}}\n*{{Internet Archive film | THEVOICEFROMTHEGRAVEVideoQualityUpgrade | The Canary Murder Case }}\n\n{{Frank Tuttle}}\n{{Malcolm St. Clair}}\n\n{{1920s-US-film-stub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canary Murder Case}}\n[[Category:1929 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American crime films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on mystery novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Malcolm St. Clair]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Frank Tuttle]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Transitional sound films]]\n[[Category:1920s mystery films]]\n", "name_user": "Lord Cornwallis", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canary_Murder_Case_(film)"}
