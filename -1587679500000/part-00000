There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)\">{{cite web |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.\n\nThe [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''les pays de par del\u00e0'' (\"the lands over there\") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.<ref name=\"BlockmansPrevenier2010\">{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&pg=PA85&dq=duke+pays+de+par+de\u00e7\u00e0#v=onepage&q=duke%20pays%20de%20par%20de\u00e7\u00e0&f=false |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85\u2013 }}</ref> Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' (\"lands down-here\"),<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=59Pae06JSiUC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History:%20Volume%202,%20The%20Reformation,%201520-1559&f=false |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520\u20131559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}</ref> a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria.

The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term \"Low Countries\" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].\n\n===Holland===\nThe Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts\u2014[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

But from 1806 to 1810, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was set up by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] to control the Netherlands more effectively. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig]].\n\n[[File:Dutch Empire35.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonial empire]].

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].\n\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)].

The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

Most of these are owned by [[Staatsbosbeheer]], the national department for [[forestry]] and [[Habitat conservation|nature conservation]] and [[Vereniging Natuurmonumenten|Natuurmonumenten]] (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the [[Wadden Sea]] in the north, with its [[tidal flat]]s and [[wetland]]s, is rich in [[biodiversity|biological diversity]], and was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Nature Site]] in 2009.\n\n[[File:Phoca vitulina Terschelling.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harbor seal|Common seals]] on [[Terschelling]], a [[Wadden Sea]] island]]\nThe [[Oosterschelde]], formerly the northeast [[estuary]] of the river [[Scheldt]] was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi}}. It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde, but also includes mud flats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]]. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the European territory of the Netherlands belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).\n\n===Caribbean islands===\n{{Main|Bonaire|Saba|Sint Eustatius}}\nWhile [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands.

Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to [[hurricanes]].\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Den Haag - panoramio - Nikolai Karaneschev.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Binnenhof]], where the lower and upper houses of the States General meet]]\nThe Netherlands has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] since 1815, and due to the efforts of [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]],<ref name=NRC>{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |date=13 March 1998 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> became a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = \n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006\u201307 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archivedate=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koel\u00e9, Theo |lastauthoramp=yes |language=Dutch |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017. The [[Korps Commandotroepen]], the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando.<ref>[http://www.korpscommandotroepen.nl/index.php?l=nl&p=118 KCT.

Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are [[Indo-Surinamese]]. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and some Western adherents of [[Hinduism in the West|Hinduism-oriented new religious movements]] such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 [[Buddhism in the Netherlands|Buddhists]] or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 45,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jews]] in the Netherlands.\n\n===Education===\n{{Main|Education in the Netherlands|Universities in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:BSN Junior School Vlaskamp.jpg|thumb|left|A primary school in The Hague]]\n[[File:ACTA - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|A [[University of Amsterdam]] building]]\n[[File:Utrecht-Uithof, from CambridgeLaan 01.jpg|thumb|left|View on the Utrecht Science Park of [[Utrecht University]].

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students.\n\n===Healthcare===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse|work=healthpowerhouse.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the [[health care system]]s of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65M0SU20100623 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. scores dead last again in healthcare study | date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110040524/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences In Seven Countries, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEver since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M. Boot, 'De Nederlandse Gezondheidszorg', Bohn Stafleu van Loghum 2011</ref> The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most cost-effective.<ref name=BCG>Boston Consulting Group, 'Zorg voor Waarde', 2011.</ref>\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=71914ned&D1=37-43&D2=a&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.<ref name=\"minvws.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.minvws.nl/en/themes/health-insurance-system/|title=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport|first=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en|last=Sport|work=minvws.nl|accessdate=26 August 2016|date=18 February 2010}}</ref> This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/>\n\nOther sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/> Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.\n\nA key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, in which the Dutch Republic was prosperous, was the age of the \"Dutch Masters\", such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. All of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done in the Netherlands since he studied at [[Leiden University]] \u2014 as did throughout the centuries geologist [[James Hutton]], British Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart]], U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]].

These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars.

Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]].

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch [[K-1]] [[Kickboxing|kickboxers]] have won the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch [[Speed skating|speed skaters']] performance at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the [[TT Circuit Assen]] has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.\n\nThe Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with [[Jan Janssen]] winning the [[1968 Tour de France]], more recently with [[Tom Dumoulin]] winning the [[2017 Giro d'Italia]] and legendary rider [[Joop Zoetemelk]] was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]], the [[1980 Tour de France]] and still holds or shares numerous [[Tour de France]] records including most Tours finished and most kilometers ridden.\n\nLimburger [[Max Verstappen]] currently races in [[Formula One]], and [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix]].

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)\">{{cite web |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.\n\nThe [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''les pays de par del\u00e0'' (\"the lands over there\") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.<ref name=\"BlockmansPrevenier2010\">{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&pg=PA85&dq=duke+pays+de+par+de\u00e7\u00e0#v=onepage&q=duke%20pays%20de%20par%20de\u00e7\u00e0&f=false |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85\u2013 }}</ref> Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' (\"lands down-here\"),<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=59Pae06JSiUC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History:%20Volume%202,%20The%20Reformation,%201520-1559&f=false |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520\u20131559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}</ref> a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria.

The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term \"Low Countries\" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].\n\n===Holland===\nThe Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

The southern region became dominated by the related [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n===Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC\u2013410 AD)===\n{{Main|Iron Age Europe|Celts|Germanic peoples|Romans in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Celtic expansion in Europe.svg|thumb|150px|left|{{legend|#FFFF43|[[Diachronic linguistics|Diachronic]] distribution of [[Celtic people]] from 500 BC}}{{legend|#97FFB6|Expansion into the southern [[Low Countries]] by 270 BC}}]]\nFrom 800 BC onwards, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] became influential, replacing the [[Hilversum culture]].

However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts\u2014[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].\n\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|0|adj=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country).

The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of {{convert|1.10|m|ft}} and a simultaneous land height decline of {{convert|10|cm|in}}. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like [[Levee|dikes]] and [[dune]]s with {{convert|1.30|m|ft}} of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another program is already being executed. The [[Room for the River (Netherlands)|Room for the River plan]] grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called \"overflow areas\" have been moved to higher ground, with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.<ref name=NYT021313>{{cite news|title=Going With the Flow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/design/flood-control-in-the-netherlands-now-allows-sea-water-in.html|accessdate=19 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 February 2013|author=Kimmelman, Michael}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe predominant wind direction in the European Netherlands is southwest, which causes a mild [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with moderately warm summers and cool winters, and typically high humidity.

If one chooses the height of measurement to be {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} above ground instead of {{convert|150|cm|0|abbr=on}}, one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but sometimes occurs in May or October too.\n\nWarm days\u2014maximum temperature above {{convert|20|C|F|0}}\u2014are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in {{Not a typo|De Bilt}}, however).

Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).\n\nThe number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.\n\nThe following tables are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1981 and 2010.

Most of these are owned by [[Staatsbosbeheer]], the national department for [[forestry]] and [[Habitat conservation|nature conservation]] and [[Vereniging Natuurmonumenten|Natuurmonumenten]] (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the [[Wadden Sea]] in the north, with its [[tidal flat]]s and [[wetland]]s, is rich in [[biodiversity|biological diversity]], and was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Nature Site]] in 2009.\n\n[[File:Phoca vitulina Terschelling.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harbor seal|Common seals]] on [[Terschelling]], a [[Wadden Sea]] island]]\nThe [[Oosterschelde]], formerly the northeast [[estuary]] of the river [[Scheldt]] was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi}}. It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde, but also includes mud flats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]]. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the European territory of the Netherlands belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).\n\n===Caribbean islands===\n{{Main|Bonaire|Saba|Sint Eustatius}}\nWhile [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands.

The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.\n* [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] are part of the [[SSS islands]]. They are located east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands.

The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = \n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006\u201307 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archivedate=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koel\u00e9, Theo |lastauthoramp=yes |language=Dutch |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017.

The largest of these is the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (PKN), a [[United and uniting churches|United]] church which is [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] in orientation.<ref name=\"CBS 2009\">{{cite news |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37944&D1=0-5,10&D2=29-40&VW=T |title=Kerkelijke gezindte en kerkbezoek; vanaf 1849; 18 jaar of ouder |date=15 October 2010}}</ref> It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands|a smaller Lutheran Church]].

Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a [[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Bible Belt]] from [[Zeeland]] to the northern parts of the province [[Overijssel]], in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.\n\n[[Islam]] is the second largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 [[Islam in the Netherlands|Muslims]] in the Netherlands (5% of the population).<ref name=CBS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/vrije-tijd-cultuur/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3759-wm.htm|title=Een op de zes bezoekt regelmatig kerk of moskee|work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Netherlands|year=2012|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref> The Muslim population increased from the 1960 as a result of large numbers of [[Demography of the Netherlands#Migration and ethnicity|migrant workers]].

Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are [[Indo-Surinamese]]. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and some Western adherents of [[Hinduism in the West|Hinduism-oriented new religious movements]] such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 [[Buddhism in the Netherlands|Buddhists]] or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students.\n\n===Healthcare===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse|work=healthpowerhouse.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the [[health care system]]s of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65M0SU20100623 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. scores dead last again in healthcare study | date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110040524/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences In Seven Countries, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEver since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M. Boot, 'De Nederlandse Gezondheidszorg', Bohn Stafleu van Loghum 2011</ref> The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most cost-effective.<ref name=BCG>Boston Consulting Group, 'Zorg voor Waarde', 2011.</ref>\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=71914ned&D1=37-43&D2=a&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.<ref name=\"minvws.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.minvws.nl/en/themes/health-insurance-system/|title=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport|first=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en|last=Sport|work=minvws.nl|accessdate=26 August 2016|date=18 February 2010}}</ref> This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/>\n\nOther sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/> Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.\n\nA key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, in which the Dutch Republic was prosperous, was the age of the \"Dutch Masters\", such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. All of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done in the Netherlands since he studied at [[Leiden University]] \u2014 as did throughout the centuries geologist [[James Hutton]], British Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart]], U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]].

These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]].

Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]].

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch [[K-1]] [[Kickboxing|kickboxers]] have won the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch [[Speed skating|speed skaters']] performance at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the [[TT Circuit Assen]] has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.\n\nThe Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with [[Jan Janssen]] winning the [[1968 Tour de France]], more recently with [[Tom Dumoulin]] winning the [[2017 Giro d'Italia]] and legendary rider [[Joop Zoetemelk]] was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]], the [[1980 Tour de France]] and still holds or shares numerous [[Tour de France]] records including most Tours finished and most kilometers ridden.\n\nLimburger [[Max Verstappen]] currently races in [[Formula One]], and [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix]].

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of [[Love song|slow ballads]] and [[dance-pop|up-tempo]] tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with [[Ben Margulies]], which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Tommy Mottola]]. ''Mariah Carey'' featured production and writing from [[Rhett Lawrence]], [[Ric Wake]] and [[Narada Michael Walden]], all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.\n\nReviews of the album generally complimented Carey's voice and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It nonetheless became a commercial success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. ''Mariah Carey'' was certified nine-times [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine&nbsp;million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times [[List of music recording certifications|Platinum]]. ''Mariah Carey'' fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 20 million copies making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best selling albums]] of all time.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. \"[[Vision of Love]]\" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female artist. The album's second single, \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" was also well received and topped the charts in Canada and the US. With the following two singles, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" and \"[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]\" reaching number one in the US, Carey became the first artist since [[The Jackson 5]] to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1988, an 18-year-old Carey moved out of her mother's house in Long Island, and into a small apartment in Manhattan.<ref name=\"nick\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=20}}</ref> She had a demo tape consisting of four songs, which she had written during her high school years with [[Ben Margulies]].<ref name=\"nick\"/> As 1988 unfolded, Carey, still without a record deal, struggled to draw the attention of record executives in New York. While working several jobs, she continued writing and producing music with Margulies, making changes and additions to the demo.<ref name=\"nick2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=22}}</ref> After months of difficulty, Carey met with singer [[Brenda K. Starr]], and soon began singing back-up for her.<ref name=\"nick2\"/> Eventually, Starr began hearing what she described as \"glimpses\" of Carey's voice throughout sessions, and noticed her \"gifted voice\".<ref name=\"nick3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=23}}</ref> She realized Carey was capable of achieving success, but only needed help to break through into mainstream music.<ref name=\"nick3\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I really didn't want to do it, but I said its gotta be better than what I'm doing now. So I went to the audition, and Brenda was such a great person.\"|source=\u2014Carey, on auditioning for her position as back-up with Starr<ref name=\"nick2\"/>\n }}\nOne night, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala, attempting to convince a record label executive to listen her demo.<ref name=\"nick4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> [[Jerry L. Greenberg]], president of [[Atlantic Records]] took notice of her.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Carey handed him the record, [[Tommy Mottola]] quickly grabbed the tape, insisting that he would deal with \"the project\".<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Mottola got into his limousine later that evening, he played Carey's demo and quickly realized the talent that he had just discovered. He quickly returned to the event, but a discouraged Carey had already left.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=27%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=\"For this particular time, she is my number one priority. We don't look at her as a dance-pop artist. We look at her as a franchise.\"|source=\u2014[[Don Ienner]], president of Columbia Records, on his plans for working with Carey<ref name=\"nick5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=27}}</ref>\n }}\nAfter a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"nick4\"/> After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n\nMottola had assumed the top position at [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through various stages of change.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> One he felt was very important for the label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival [[Whitney Houston]] from [[Arista Records]], or a pop star to match [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who was signed to [[Sire Records]] at the time.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n\n==Recording and composition==\n{{listen\n | pos          = right\n | filename     = Mariah Carey - I don't wanna cry(1).ogg\n | title        = \"I Don't Wanna Cry\"\n | description  = A sample of the song, featuring the yearning lyrics and tempo Carey incorporated with Walden.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n\n | pos2         = right\n | filename2    = All in Your Mind.ogg\n | title2       = \"All in Your Mind\"\n | description2 = A sample of the song, featuring the vocal flip Carey described as a highlight during the album's recording.\n | format2      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=\"When we met she was 17 years old and I was 24.

While he described Carey as \"very shy,\" he noted how professional she was for someone her age.<ref name=\"nick6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=28}}</ref> Additionally, Carey wrote \"There's Got to Be a Way\" during her first recording session with Wake.<ref name=\"nick7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=29}}</ref> During the session, they wrote four songs, but they only produced the latter song for the album. After flying to New York and working with Carey, Walden was astonished by her voice.<ref name=\"nick7\"/> Together, they collaborated on transforming many of the demo's songs into more commercial recordings, which took place in Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, California.<ref name=\"nick8\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=30}}</ref> For her work with Lawrence, Carey traveled to New York once again. In the studio, she presented him with the demo of \"Vision of Love\" which she had written with Margulies years prior. Lawrence saw \"potential\" in the song, but he did not think much of it in its early stages.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> He described the song's sound as having a \"fifties sort of shuffle\".<ref name=\"nick8\"/> According to Lawrence, Carey needed a more contemporary sound, so they met in the studio alongside Margulies and producer Chris Toland. They added a new arrangement to the original [[chord progression]], while Carey changed the song's melody and [[key (music)|key]]. Afterwards, Margulies added few drum [[Musical note|note]]s to the arrangement, including additional [[guitar]] and [[bass drum|bass]] notes.<ref name=\"nick8\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I was using my upper register...what happened was at the end of it, I did these vocal flips. When I was doing it, my voice split and went into a harmony. If you hear it, it splits. I was saying, 'Get rid of that,' but everyone was saying 'No way, we're keeping that'.\"|source=\u2014Carey, on the high notes she hit while experimenting with her voice in the studio<ref name=\"nick10\"/>\n }}\nWhen Carey worked with Walden on \"I Don't Wanna Cry\", they worked on several other songs.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> Together, they decided to \"slow down the tempo\" and create a \"crying type of ballad,\" one which according to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> After they completed the song, Lawrence noted how much of a perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct \"one line\" that troubled her.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" became Wake's favorite from the start, \"I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me.\"<ref name=\"nick9\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=31}}</ref> During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> In \"All in Your Mind\", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing [[staccato]]s up to F7.<ref>[http://www.divalegacy.com/php/main_pages.php?CategoryID=3&AuthorID=3&ID=18 The Acuto Sfogato]</ref> According to the artist, her voice \"split\" while doing those [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]].<ref name=\"nick10\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=32}}</ref> While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.<ref name=\"nick10\"/>\n\nThe debut album was completed and being mastered when Carey wrote \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\"\nCarey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for [[Columbia Records]] president [[Don Ienner]]. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and [[Bobby Colomby]].\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker,\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.\n\nThe demo was sent to producer Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label.  \"I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,\" remembers Afanasieff. \"He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\"\n\nThe demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\"\n\nAfanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, \"We're going to do our best.\"\n\nOn the first copies of the album that were printed, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc liner notes, even though the song was on the cassette or CD itself.  \"(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song,\" Margulies laughs. \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\"<ref>[http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml#ltt \"Hero\" inside story<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622140004/http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml |date=June 22, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nAside from the heavy marketing and promotional campaign held by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], Carey performed on several television programs and award ceremonies, stateside and throughout Europe.

Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of [[Love song|slow ballads]] and [[dance-pop|up-tempo]] tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with [[Ben Margulies]], which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Tommy Mottola]]. ''Mariah Carey'' featured production and writing from [[Rhett Lawrence]], [[Ric Wake]] and [[Narada Michael Walden]], all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.\n\nReviews of the album generally complimented Carey's voice and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It nonetheless became a commercial success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. ''Mariah Carey'' was certified nine-times [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine&nbsp;million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times [[List of music recording certifications|Platinum]]. ''Mariah Carey'' fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 20 million copies making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best selling albums]] of all time.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. \"[[Vision of Love]]\" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female artist. The album's second single, \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" was also well received and topped the charts in Canada and the US. With the following two singles, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" and \"[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]\" reaching number one in the US, Carey became the first artist since [[The Jackson 5]] to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1988, an 18-year-old Carey moved out of her mother's house in Long Island, and into a small apartment in Manhattan.<ref name=\"nick\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=20}}</ref> She had a demo tape consisting of four songs, which she had written during her high school years with [[Ben Margulies]].<ref name=\"nick\"/> As 1988 unfolded, Carey, still without a record deal, struggled to draw the attention of record executives in New York. While working several jobs, she continued writing and producing music with Margulies, making changes and additions to the demo.<ref name=\"nick2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=22}}</ref> After months of difficulty, Carey met with singer [[Brenda K. Starr]], and soon began singing back-up for her.<ref name=\"nick2\"/> Eventually, Starr began hearing what she described as \"glimpses\" of Carey's voice throughout sessions, and noticed her \"gifted voice\".<ref name=\"nick3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=23}}</ref> She realized Carey was capable of achieving success, but only needed help to break through into mainstream music.<ref name=\"nick3\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I really didn't want to do it, but I said its gotta be better than what I'm doing now. So I went to the audition, and Brenda was such a great person.\"|source=\u2014Carey, on auditioning for her position as back-up with Starr<ref name=\"nick2\"/>\n }}\nOne night, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala, attempting to convince a record label executive to listen her demo.<ref name=\"nick4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> [[Jerry L. Greenberg]], president of [[Atlantic Records]] took notice of her.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Carey handed him the record, [[Tommy Mottola]] quickly grabbed the tape, insisting that he would deal with \"the project\".<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Mottola got into his limousine later that evening, he played Carey's demo and quickly realized the talent that he had just discovered. He quickly returned to the event, but a discouraged Carey had already left.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=27%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=\"For this particular time, she is my number one priority. We don't look at her as a dance-pop artist. We look at her as a franchise.\"|source=\u2014[[Don Ienner]], president of Columbia Records, on his plans for working with Carey<ref name=\"nick5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=27}}</ref>\n }}\nAfter a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"nick4\"/> After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n\nMottola had assumed the top position at [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through various stages of change.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> One he felt was very important for the label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival [[Whitney Houston]] from [[Arista Records]], or a pop star to match [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who was signed to [[Sire Records]] at the time.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material.

While he described Carey as \"very shy,\" he noted how professional she was for someone her age.<ref name=\"nick6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=28}}</ref> Additionally, Carey wrote \"There's Got to Be a Way\" during her first recording session with Wake.<ref name=\"nick7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=29}}</ref> During the session, they wrote four songs, but they only produced the latter song for the album. After flying to New York and working with Carey, Walden was astonished by her voice.<ref name=\"nick7\"/> Together, they collaborated on transforming many of the demo's songs into more commercial recordings, which took place in Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, California.<ref name=\"nick8\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=30}}</ref> For her work with Lawrence, Carey traveled to New York once again. In the studio, she presented him with the demo of \"Vision of Love\" which she had written with Margulies years prior. Lawrence saw \"potential\" in the song, but he did not think much of it in its early stages.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> He described the song's sound as having a \"fifties sort of shuffle\".<ref name=\"nick8\"/> According to Lawrence, Carey needed a more contemporary sound, so they met in the studio alongside Margulies and producer Chris Toland. They added a new arrangement to the original [[chord progression]], while Carey changed the song's melody and [[key (music)|key]]. Afterwards, Margulies added few drum [[Musical note|note]]s to the arrangement, including additional [[guitar]] and [[bass drum|bass]] notes.<ref name=\"nick8\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I was using my upper register...what happened was at the end of it, I did these vocal flips. When I was doing it, my voice split and went into a harmony. If you hear it, it splits.

He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct \"one line\" that troubled her.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" became Wake's favorite from the start, \"I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me.\"<ref name=\"nick9\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=31}}</ref> During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> In \"All in Your Mind\", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing [[staccato]]s up to F7.<ref>[http://www.divalegacy.com/php/main_pages.php?CategoryID=3&AuthorID=3&ID=18 The Acuto Sfogato]</ref> According to the artist, her voice \"split\" while doing those [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]].<ref name=\"nick10\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=32}}</ref> While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.<ref name=\"nick10\"/>\n\nThe debut album was completed and being mastered when Carey wrote \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\"\nCarey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for [[Columbia Records]] president [[Don Ienner]]. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and [[Bobby Colomby]].\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker,\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.\n\nThe demo was sent to producer Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label.  \"I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,\" remembers Afanasieff. \"He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\"\n\nThe demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\"\n\nAfanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, \"We're going to do our best.\"\n\nOn the first copies of the album that were printed, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc liner notes, even though the song was on the cassette or CD itself.  \"(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song,\" Margulies laughs. \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\"<ref>[http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml#ltt \"Hero\" inside story<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622140004/http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml |date=June 22, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nAside from the heavy marketing and promotional campaign held by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], Carey performed on several television programs and award ceremonies, stateside and throughout Europe.

Writing for [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]], Elena Bergeron described the record as \"the album that launched a million runs\", stating that it \"gave an entire generation of would-be divas something to sing into their hairbrushes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/best-90s-r-and-b-albums/|title=The 50 Best R&B Albums of the '90s|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> R&B singer [[Beyonc\u00e9]] said that she began doing vocal \"runs\" after listening to \"Vision of Love\" for the first time, stating that it inspired her to follow a path into the music industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/03/on-top|title=On Top|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|date=2006-03-27|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> Christina Aguilera has also stated how Carey's album had the biggest influence on her vocal stylings and delivery. According to the Pier Dominguez, author of ''Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made'', Carey's carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera, whose influence also stemmed from the fact that both were of mixed heritage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/christinaaguiler0000domi|title=Christina Aguilera : a star is made : the unauthorized biography|last=Dominguez|first=Pier|date=2003|publisher=Phoenix : Colossus Books|others=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nCarey's two wins at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards]] was also commented upon by critics, particularly in regards to the lip-syncing controversy surrounding [[Milli Vanilli]] the prior year. Speaking to the press after winning [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], Carey stated: \"With all the controversy surrounding this award, I hope to bring it back to a real singer-songwriter category, where everyone else following me can be as proud as I am to receive this honor\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Mariah Carey- Grammy Awards press room Interview (1991)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF1cHRR8BSU|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The singer's performance of \"Vision of Love\" at the ceremony has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest award show performances of all time. Andrew Unterberger of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] described it as showcasing Carey \"in full beast mode, tracing her unprecedented vocal runs with her hands and occasionally running out of room in the process; not excessively showy but unafraid of demonstrating\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/7677099/best-award-show-performances-of-all-time|title=The 100 Greatest Award Show Performances of All Time|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Unterberger further commented on Carey's exposure to the wider pop landscape following her debut at the award show, commenting on how \"Mariah's self-titled debut LP shot to the top of the Billboard 200 and stayed there for 11 weeks\" in the wake of her appearance. \n\nThe singer's outspokenness about her own multi-racial heritage at the time of her debut's release has also been commented upon by both music critics and sociologists alike. As noted by Professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] in his book, ''Between God and Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness to Black Culture,'' Carey's \"refusal to bow to public pressure\" surrounding the nature of her ethnicity exposed \"the messy, sometimes arbitrary, politics of definition and categorisation\" and \"the racial contradictions at the centre of contemporary pop music\" at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/pop-view-black-or-white-labels-don-t-always-fit.html|title=POP VIEW; Black or White?

Lery describes the constitution of the average Tupinamba person:\n\n{{quote|Not taller, fatter, or smaller in stature than we Europeans are; their bodies are neither monstrous, nor prodigious with respect to ours.

When describing the skin tone of the average Tupinamba person Lery states\n\n{{quote|They are not particularly dark, but merely of tawny shade, like the Spanish or provencals<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=57}}</ref>}}\n\nL\u00e9ry then discusses how the Tupinamba people are completely comfortable with being naked, especially the women.\n\n{{quote|We tried several times to give them dresses and shifts (as I have said we did for the men, who sometimes put them on) it has never been our power to make them wear clothes: to such a point were they resolved (and I think they have not changed their minds) not to allow anything at all on their bodies<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=66}}</ref>}}\n\n===Bodily modifications===\nMuch of the chapter is dedicated to describing various body modifications Lery witnessed among men and women of the [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamba]] nation including, but not limited to, tattoos and piercings. Lery states that men more often modify their bodies than women do. Lery describes a tradition of piercing the lower lip in young boys and inserting a bone an inch wide and that can be removed at any time. On this page he also describes how after birth, babies often have their noses pushed in to make their noses seem more attractive.\n\n{{quote|However, our Americans, for whom the beauty of their children lies in being pug-nosed, have the noses of their children pushed in and crushed with the thumb as soon as they come out of their mother\u2019s wombs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=58}}</ref>}}\n\n===Tattoos===\nTattoos are described as being made with the dye of the [[genipap]] fruit. Lery states that often people would blacken their legs and that the dye is to a degree waterproof and can take up to twelve days to wash off.

This process is noted to have involved feathers from hens, red dye from [[Brazilwood]] (he described how other tribes used other colored dyes from different objects), and boiling the feathers.<ref name=\"L\u00e9ry 1993 61\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=61}}</ref> A gum was used as an adhesive and the feathers were chopped up with iron tools they procured from the colonists. Once this process was complete these feathers were put all over the body. Lery described how in some accounts these feathers have led to a misconception in Europe that the Tupinamba were covered in hair, and he stated this is not the case and that naturally the Tupinamba did not have a lot of hair on their bodies. It is also mentioned that feathers from a Toucan were often placed in the front of the ear and attached with an adhesive gum by many women. Ostrich feathers are also said to have been attached along a cotton thread to make a decorative hip belt.<ref name=\"L\u00e9ry 1993 61\"/>\n\nL\u00e9ry states that Tupinamba people would regularly strip their bodies of hair which included eyebrows and eyelashes. Women would have their hair long, while men would typically shave their heads.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=64}}</ref>\n\n===Jewelry and necklaces===\nAccording to L\u00e9ry, the Tupinamba people had different types of necklaces. He wrote about what the natives called a boure which was made with pieces of seashells that were  polished on a sandstone which then were pierced and lined along a cotton string. Lery also notes that boure can be made with a type of 'black wood' that has a similar appearance to seashell boure. Women also made bracelets around their arms that were made of bones joined together with a gum.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=59}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil order and everyday life ===\nL\u00e9ry describes the customs of the [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people]], how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people live, and how they treat their guests. For the most part, Jean de L\u00e9ry indicates that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people are peaceful, but rarely a fight breaks out between them that may end in a death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=158}}</ref> The family of the deceased then has the right to kill the murderer as the Tupinamb\u00e1 people believe in revenge, such as a life for a life.\n\nL\u00e9ry also recounts the living setup of the Tupinamb\u00e1 people.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazi|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=159}}</ref> The houses are big and are made out of wood and pindo plants. Although families live in the same house, they are separated and have their own space, including land to plant crops. From time to time, the Tupinamb\u00e1 people would move their houses to a different location and when Jean de L\u00e9ry asked for the reason why he was told that,<blockquote>\u201cThe change of air keeps them healthier, and that if they did other than what their grandfathers did, they would die immediately\u201d <ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>Jean de L\u00e9ry then goes in depth on how women spin cotton in order to make the beds that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people sleep on.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=161}}</ref> Based on the description Jean de L\u00e9ry gives, the beds are [[hammock]]<nowiki/>s that are set up outside the houses. In addition to spinning cotton, women also do the majority of the housework and make pottery.\n\n===Cannibalism===\nL\u00e9ry also describes an event that occurred to him regarding [[cannibalism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=163}}</ref> When he and his interpreter made a stop at one of the villages, he was greeted accordingly and realized that the Tupinamba people were in the midst of a celebration. This celebration consisted of dancing, cooking, and eating a prisoner they had killed earlier. Jean de L\u00e9ry did not want to participate in the celebration and stayed at his bed alone. However, one of the Tupinamba people came and offered him the prisoner's foot, but since Jean de L\u00e9ry's interpreter was not present, he thought they were threatening to eat him. By morning, Jean de L\u00e9ry realized his error and was afraid for nothing.\n\n=== Treatment of guests ===\nThe customs of the Tupinamb\u00e1 people regarding how they treat guests consisted of seating their guests on a bed while the women wept in gratitude for their visit.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=164}}</ref> During this, the head of the household makes an arrow and when he is done, he greets the guest and offers them food. The guests must eat on the ground since there are no tables. After the women are done weeping, they serve the guest fruit or other small gifts. If the guest desires to sleep there, their bed is hung among several fires to keep them warm. At the end of the visit, gifts are exchanged, which are usually small since the Tupinamb\u00e1 people travel by walking and do not have animals to carry cargo for them. Jean de L\u00e9ry praises the treatment he has received from the Tupinamb\u00e1 people and even compares it to the French, as he states,<blockquote>\u201c...I can\u2019t help saying that the hypocritical welcomes of those over here who sue slippery speech for consolidation of the afflicted is a far cry from the humanity of these people, whom nonetheless we call \u201c\u2018barbarians\u2019\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=168}}</ref></blockquote>Lastly, Jean de L\u00e9ry describes how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people make fires through the use of sticks only.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=166}}</ref> He describes their method and how they deem it necessary to have fire with them at all times due to their fear of an evil spirit called Aygnan. He ends the chapter explaining that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people and the French get along well because they have a common enemy: the Portuguese.\n\n=== Illnesses and death ===\nJean de L\u00e9ry describes how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people treat illnesses and how they handle deaths. If someone has a wound and bedridden, they are treated through suction and are not fed unless they explicitly ask for food. However, celebrations still continue as normal. The most dangerous disease that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people cannot treat is called pians and occurs through lechery.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=173}}</ref> Jean de L\u00e9ry compares it to [[smallpox]] and states that it affects the entire body and lasts for a lifetime.\n\nIf someone dies, there is great mourning as Jean de L\u00e9ry compares the cries of women to, \u201cthe howling of dogs and wolves.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Tupinamb\u00e1 people comfort each other, remember the good deeds the deceased person had done, and sing in their memory. Mourning lasts half a day, until the Tupinamb\u00e1 proceed with burying the body in the ground with jewelry the person used to wear. Jean de L\u00e9ry mentions how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people do not bury any valuable jewelry with dead bodies anymore since the French have arrived, perhaps due to past experiences with Europeans digging up graves for jewelry.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=175}}</ref> On the first night the body is buried, the Tupinamb\u00e1 people have a feast on the grace of the deceased person and do this until they believe the body has fully decayed.<ref name=\":2\" /> The rationale behind this custom is that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people believe that Aygnan, the evil spirit mentioned before, is hungry and finds no other meat around, he will dig up the dead body and eat it.

Lery describes the constitution of the average Tupinamba person:\n\n{{quote|Not taller, fatter, or smaller in stature than we Europeans are; their bodies are neither monstrous, nor prodigious with respect to ours.

When describing the skin tone of the average Tupinamba person Lery states\n\n{{quote|They are not particularly dark, but merely of tawny shade, like the Spanish or provencals<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=57}}</ref>}}\n\nL\u00e9ry then discusses how the Tupinamba people are completely comfortable with being naked, especially the women.\n\n{{quote|We tried several times to give them dresses and shifts (as I have said we did for the men, who sometimes put them on) it has never been our power to make them wear clothes: to such a point were they resolved (and I think they have not changed their minds) not to allow anything at all on their bodies<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=66}}</ref>}}\n\n===Bodily modifications===\nMuch of the chapter is dedicated to describing various body modifications Lery witnessed among men and women of the [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamba]] nation including, but not limited to, tattoos and piercings. Lery states that men more often modify their bodies than women do. Lery describes a tradition of piercing the lower lip in young boys and inserting a bone an inch wide and that can be removed at any time. On this page he also describes how after birth, babies often have their noses pushed in to make their noses seem more attractive.\n\n{{quote|However, our Americans, for whom the beauty of their children lies in being pug-nosed, have the noses of their children pushed in and crushed with the thumb as soon as they come out of their mother\u2019s wombs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=58}}</ref>}}\n\n===Tattoos===\nTattoos are described as being made with the dye of the [[genipap]] fruit. Lery states that often people would blacken their legs and that the dye is to a degree waterproof and can take up to twelve days to wash off. Some of these painting are put over incisions they make on their skin that show how many people they have killed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=65}}</ref>\n\nL\u00e9ry also describes facial paintings. This process is noted to have involved feathers from hens, red dye from [[Brazilwood]] (he described how other tribes used other colored dyes from different objects), and boiling the feathers.<ref name=\"L\u00e9ry 1993 61\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=61}}</ref> A gum was used as an adhesive and the feathers were chopped up with iron tools they procured from the colonists. Once this process was complete these feathers were put all over the body. Lery described how in some accounts these feathers have led to a misconception in Europe that the Tupinamba were covered in hair, and he stated this is not the case and that naturally the Tupinamba did not have a lot of hair on their bodies. It is also mentioned that feathers from a Toucan were often placed in the front of the ear and attached with an adhesive gum by many women. Ostrich feathers are also said to have been attached along a cotton thread to make a decorative hip belt.<ref name=\"L\u00e9ry 1993 61\"/>\n\nL\u00e9ry states that Tupinamba people would regularly strip their bodies of hair which included eyebrows and eyelashes. Women would have their hair long, while men would typically shave their heads.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=64}}</ref>\n\n===Jewelry and necklaces===\nAccording to L\u00e9ry, the Tupinamba people had different types of necklaces. He wrote about what the natives called a boure which was made with pieces of seashells that were  polished on a sandstone which then were pierced and lined along a cotton string. Lery also notes that boure can be made with a type of 'black wood' that has a similar appearance to seashell boure. Women also made bracelets around their arms that were made of bones joined together with a gum.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=59}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil order and everyday life ===\nL\u00e9ry describes the customs of the [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people]], how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people live, and how they treat their guests. For the most part, Jean de L\u00e9ry indicates that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people are peaceful, but rarely a fight breaks out between them that may end in a death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=158}}</ref> The family of the deceased then has the right to kill the murderer as the Tupinamb\u00e1 people believe in revenge, such as a life for a life.\n\nL\u00e9ry also recounts the living setup of the Tupinamb\u00e1 people.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazi|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=159}}</ref> The houses are big and are made out of wood and pindo plants. Although families live in the same house, they are separated and have their own space, including land to plant crops. From time to time, the Tupinamb\u00e1 people would move their houses to a different location and when Jean de L\u00e9ry asked for the reason why he was told that,<blockquote>\u201cThe change of air keeps them healthier, and that if they did other than what their grandfathers did, they would die immediately\u201d <ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>Jean de L\u00e9ry then goes in depth on how women spin cotton in order to make the beds that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people sleep on.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=161}}</ref> Based on the description Jean de L\u00e9ry gives, the beds are [[hammock]]<nowiki/>s that are set up outside the houses. In addition to spinning cotton, women also do the majority of the housework and make pottery.\n\n===Cannibalism===\nL\u00e9ry also describes an event that occurred to him regarding [[cannibalism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=163}}</ref> When he and his interpreter made a stop at one of the villages, he was greeted accordingly and realized that the Tupinamba people were in the midst of a celebration. This celebration consisted of dancing, cooking, and eating a prisoner they had killed earlier. Jean de L\u00e9ry did not want to participate in the celebration and stayed at his bed alone. However, one of the Tupinamba people came and offered him the prisoner's foot, but since Jean de L\u00e9ry's interpreter was not present, he thought they were threatening to eat him. By morning, Jean de L\u00e9ry realized his error and was afraid for nothing.\n\n=== Treatment of guests ===\nThe customs of the Tupinamb\u00e1 people regarding how they treat guests consisted of seating their guests on a bed while the women wept in gratitude for their visit.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=164}}</ref> During this, the head of the household makes an arrow and when he is done, he greets the guest and offers them food. The guests must eat on the ground since there are no tables. After the women are done weeping, they serve the guest fruit or other small gifts. If the guest desires to sleep there, their bed is hung among several fires to keep them warm. At the end of the visit, gifts are exchanged, which are usually small since the Tupinamb\u00e1 people travel by walking and do not have animals to carry cargo for them. Jean de L\u00e9ry praises the treatment he has received from the Tupinamb\u00e1 people and even compares it to the French, as he states,<blockquote>\u201c...I can\u2019t help saying that the hypocritical welcomes of those over here who sue slippery speech for consolidation of the afflicted is a far cry from the humanity of these people, whom nonetheless we call \u201c\u2018barbarians\u2019\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=168}}</ref></blockquote>Lastly, Jean de L\u00e9ry describes how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people make fires through the use of sticks only.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=166}}</ref> He describes their method and how they deem it necessary to have fire with them at all times due to their fear of an evil spirit called Aygnan. He ends the chapter explaining that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people and the French get along well because they have a common enemy: the Portuguese.\n\n=== Illnesses and death ===\nJean de L\u00e9ry describes how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people treat illnesses and how they handle deaths. If someone has a wound and bedridden, they are treated through suction and are not fed unless they explicitly ask for food. However, celebrations still continue as normal. The most dangerous disease that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people cannot treat is called pians and occurs through lechery.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=173}}</ref> Jean de L\u00e9ry compares it to [[smallpox]] and states that it affects the entire body and lasts for a lifetime.\n\nIf someone dies, there is great mourning as Jean de L\u00e9ry compares the cries of women to, \u201cthe howling of dogs and wolves.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Tupinamb\u00e1 people comfort each other, remember the good deeds the deceased person had done, and sing in their memory. Mourning lasts half a day, until the Tupinamb\u00e1 proceed with burying the body in the ground with jewelry the person used to wear. Jean de L\u00e9ry mentions how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people do not bury any valuable jewelry with dead bodies anymore since the French have arrived, perhaps due to past experiences with Europeans digging up graves for jewelry.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=L\u00e9ry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=175}}</ref> On the first night the body is buried, the Tupinamb\u00e1 people have a feast on the grace of the deceased person and do this until they believe the body has fully decayed.<ref name=\":2\" /> The rationale behind this custom is that the Tupinamb\u00e1 people believe that Aygnan, the evil spirit mentioned before, is hungry and finds no other meat around, he will dig up the dead body and eat it. Thus, the celebration occurs for protection.

The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]].

However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]].

Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son.

However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]].

Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

In May 1903, he became a member of the Bloemfontein Native Vigilance Committee (BNCV) which superseded the Native Committee of the Bloemfontein district. \nIn 1904, he was instrumental in the forming of the Orange River Colony Vigilance Association and in 1906 became its office bearer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Le Roux|first1=CPJ|date= 1997|title= The role of TM Mapikela in the municipal administration of black affairs in Bloemfontein 1902-1945|journal= Historia|volume=42|issue=2|pages=67\u201379}}</ref>\nThe establishment and the formation of the Native Vigilance Association and the Orange River Colony Native Association (later named the Orange River Native Congress - ORNC), paved the way for Mapikela's political prominence. These political parties mainly fought for the enfranchisement of black people, including granting full political rights to blacks and safeguarding the political, social and religious welfare of African people.

The juxtaposition between sacred object and sexual attraction makes for a conflicting yet entertaining subject.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation}}\n\nOne of the themes of the series is femininity and the role of women. The artist describes the home as the territory of the women, and by taking pictures of women within their own homes we are granted a glimpse into this constructed world. For example, one of the subjects surrounds herself with self-portraits and includes her personal waiter in the scene, putting on display that this is a space dedicated to her. In these highly cluttered environments the female models blend in with the lavish objects and Rossell uses this composition to reemphasize the objectifying of women in photographs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation or WP:OPINION}} Often seen in fashion and commercial advertising campaigns the women photographed become synonymous with the object being sold.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation or WP:OPINION}}\n\nAnother theme that is found in the series is Mexican history and identity. Rather than depicting the romanticized views of the Mexican villages or the harsh images of the urban poor, Rossell depicts the wealthy minority. Rossell herself  is a part of this demographic and in turn this is the Mexican history she relates to.

This quest to look American requires these models to modify their lifestyle and manipulation of identity that is a form of unhappiness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation or is this WP:OPINION}} Despite having materialistically everything, these women struggle to find satisfaction in who they are because of the fantasy portrayed of America. When looking at the photographs is the large amounts of art and non-Christian icons mixed with Christian art found in these lavish homes. For example, one woman is posed lying seductively across a massive sized Buddha surrounded by champagne and money. The juxtaposition between sacred object and sexual attraction makes for a conflicting yet entertaining subject.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation}}\n\nOne of the themes of the series is femininity and the role of women. The artist describes the home as the territory of the women, and by taking pictures of women within their own homes we are granted a glimpse into this constructed world. For example, one of the subjects surrounds herself with self-portraits and includes her personal waiter in the scene, putting on display that this is a space dedicated to her. In these highly cluttered environments the female models blend in with the lavish objects and Rossell uses this composition to reemphasize the objectifying of women in photographs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation or WP:OPINION}} Often seen in fashion and commercial advertising campaigns the women photographed become synonymous with the object being sold.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=This requires a citation or WP:OPINION}}\n\nAnother theme that is found in the series is Mexican history and identity. Rather than depicting the romanticized views of the Mexican villages or the harsh images of the urban poor, Rossell depicts the wealthy minority. Rossell herself  is a part of this demographic and in turn this is the Mexican history she relates to. Also, the elite lives of her subjects were unknown to the rest of Mexico, her photographs also serve as social and political documents.
