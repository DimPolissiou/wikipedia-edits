However, some provinces  experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. After peaking in 1891, Prince Edward Island's population started to decline every year until 1941, after which the Province started growing again. In Saskatchewan, after rapid population explosion at the beginning of the century, its population declined during the [[Great Depression]], and it's growth had been slow ever since. From 1931 to 2016, Saskatchewan's population only raised by 19.2%, well below the national average. Newfoundland and Labrador, on the other hand, experienced slow but continuous growth until the 1990s, when the [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland#20th century fishing methods and the fishery collapse|cod fisheries collapsed]], and their population started to fall.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Canadian Birth rate, most provinces now sustain their population with immigration from the developing world.

In 1840, the [[Durham Report]] recommended that [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] be united into one province. The newly created Legislative Assembly of the [[Province of Canada]] was required to have equal representation from [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]],<ref>''Union Act, 1840'', s. 12.</ref> even though the population of Canada East was considerably larger. In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67 \"Province of Canada (1841-67)\", ''Canadian Encyclopedia''.]</ref>  Lord Durham had not recommended this approach, and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions.<ref>[[iarchive:lorddurhamsrepor02durhiala/page/324|''Lord Durham's Report'', pp. 323-324.]]</ref> The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented sectional equality, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government.\n\nHowever, the 1851 census revealed that Canada West's population had surpassed Canada East's. This fact fueled demands in Canada West for the end of sectional equality and the move toward allocating seats in the legislation on the basis of population, nicknamed \"rep by pop\". This was a hotly contested issues at the constitutional conferences leading up to confederation, and the colonies reached a comprise in which the seats in the federal lower house([[House of Commons of Canada|House of commons]]) would be allocated by population, and the seats in the federal upper house([[Senate of Canada|Senate]]) would be allocated on the basis of Regions \u2014Ontario, Quebec and [[the Maritimes]]\u2014 that would each have 24 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rep-by-pop|title=Rep by Pop {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThoughout Canada's history, Ontario and Quebec were always Canada's two biggest provinces. However, their combined demographic weight decreased from over 80% upon Confederation to just over 60% in 2016. The [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] also lost importance within Canada, from around 20% upon confederation to under 7% today. The West's importance, however, has only increased, from insignificant levels in 1971 to over 30% of the country in 2016. In the first half of the 20th century, the largest western province was Saskatchewan, but its population was later eclipsed by Alberta and British Columbia.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E|title=Census profiles, 2016 census|last=|first=|date=|website=Statistics Canada|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe issue of the demographic weight of each provinces came up during the negotiations for the [[Patriation of the Constitution]], and especially discussions around the [[Amending formula (Canada)|amending formula]] of the constitution. The final formula stipulates that minor changes to the constitution had to be approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of 7 provinces representing at least 50% of the Canadian population. The essentially meant that either Ontario or Quebec had to agree to any constitutional amendments that affect all provinces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/patriation-of-the-constitution|title=Patriation of the Constitution {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>  \n\nQuebec had managed to maintain a stable demographic weight within to Canada during the first half of the 20th century due to its high birth rate.

However, some provinces  experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. After peaking in 1891, Prince Edward Island's population started to decline every year until 1941, after which the Province started growing again. In Saskatchewan, after rapid population explosion at the beginning of the century, its population declined during the [[Great Depression]], and it's growth had been slow ever since. From 1931 to 2016, Saskatchewan's population only raised by 19.2%, well below the national average. Newfoundland and Labrador, on the other hand, experienced slow but continuous growth until the 1990s, when the [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland#20th century fishing methods and the fishery collapse|cod fisheries collapsed]], and their population started to fall.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Canadian Birth rate, most provinces now sustain their population with immigration from the developing world.

In 1840, the [[Durham Report]] recommended that [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] be united into one province. The newly created Legislative Assembly of the [[Province of Canada]] was required to have equal representation from [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]],<ref>''Union Act, 1840'', s. 12.</ref> even though the population of Canada East was considerably larger. In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67 \"Province of Canada (1841-67)\", ''Canadian Encyclopedia''.]</ref>  Lord Durham had not recommended this approach, and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions.<ref>[[iarchive:lorddurhamsrepor02durhiala/page/324|''Lord Durham's Report'', pp. 323-324.]]</ref> The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented sectional equality, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government.\n\nHowever, the 1851 census revealed that Canada West's population had surpassed Canada East's. This fact fueled demands in Canada West for the end of sectional equality and the move toward allocating seats in the legislation on the basis of population, nicknamed \"rep by pop\". This was a hotly contested issues at the constitutional conferences leading up to confederation, and the colonies reached a comprise in which the seats in the federal lower house([[House of Commons of Canada|House of commons]]) would be allocated by population, and the seats in the federal upper house([[Senate of Canada|Senate]]) would be allocated on the basis of Regions \u2014Ontario, Quebec and [[the Maritimes]]\u2014 that would each have 24 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rep-by-pop|title=Rep by Pop {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThoughout Canada's history, Ontario and Quebec were always Canada's two biggest provinces. However, their combined demographic weight decreased from over 80% upon Confederation to just over 60% in 2016. The [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] also lost importance within Canada, from around 20% upon confederation to under 7% today. The West's importance, however, has only increased, from insignificant levels in 1971 to over 30% of the country in 2016. In the first half of the 20th century, the largest western province was Saskatchewan, but its population was later eclipsed by Alberta and British Columbia.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E|title=Census profiles, 2016 census|last=|first=|date=|website=Statistics Canada|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe issue of the demographic weight of each provinces came up during the negotiations for the [[Patriation of the Constitution]], and especially discussions around the [[Amending formula (Canada)|amending formula]] of the constitution. The final formula stipulates that minor changes to the constitution had to be approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of 7 provinces representing at least 50% of the Canadian population. The essentially meant that either Ontario or Quebec had to agree to any constitutional amendments that affect all provinces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/patriation-of-the-constitution|title=Patriation of the Constitution {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>  \n\nQuebec had managed to maintain a stable demographic weight within to Canada during the first half of the 20th century due to its high birth rate.
