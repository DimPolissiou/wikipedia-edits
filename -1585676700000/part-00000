It is spoken by people (known as The [[Thadou people|Thadou]] tribe) in Myanmar, mostly in the [[Chin State]] and [[Sagaing Division]]. The Thadou language is known by many names, including Thado, Thado-Pao, Th\u0101do, Thadou-kuki, Chin, and Th\u0101do-pao. There are a few dialects of this language : Hangshing, Khongsai, Kipgen, Saimar, Langiung, Sairang, Thangngeo, Haokip, Sitlhou, Singson (Shingsol). These dialects are taught in Manipur schools, however, those outside the school, such as elders, are less familiar with them. The Saimar dialect<ref>Albrecht Klose, 2001.

As of a 2001 census, the estimated total number of Thadou-Kuki speakers is 90,000. The language is rapidly becoming endangered.\n\n== Thadou Culture ==\nThe Thadou language comes from the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] phylum. The Thadou people were settled in dense jungle sites. The Thadou villages mostly cultivated agriculture and domesticated animals. A unique aspect of the Thadou culture is that men and women shared these cultivation and domestication responsibilities.\n\nKnowing a language connects one to the culture and traditions of the speakers of the language. This was especially the case with the Thadou language. Four important words in this language: ''chongmou, sahapsat, jol-lha','' and ''kijam mang.'' These terms represent four different forms of marriage. ''Chongmou'' represents the form of marriage where there is a negotiation price of the bride between the parents of the groom as well as the parents of the bride, along with feasting and wrestling. The ''sahapsat'' is a form of marriage where just the negotiation between the parents of the bride and groom take place. The ''jol-Iha' and kijam mang'' both are similar forms of marriage, equivalent to eloping. Divorce is allowed and happens often within this culture. Children have a lot of independence in this culture and are encouraged to learn through experience including parental guidance as a stepping stone.\n\nThadou people consider Pathen the god who has created everything and is thus, the ruler of the universe. They pray to him in times of need and trouble. This culture is very into religious ceremonies. Many of their ceremonies are specific to individual groups or genders. In earlier times, the Thadou also believe in spirits moving on to Mithikho, which is the village of the dead. As time passed by most of the Thadou people embraced Christianity.\n\n==Geographical distribution  ==\n\nThadou is spoken in the following locations (''[[Ethnologue]]'').\n\n*[[Northeast India]]\n**[[Manipur]]\n***[[Chandel district]]\n***[[Churachandpur district]]\n***[[Senapati district]]\n**[[Assam]]\n***[[Karbi Anglong district|Karbi Anglong]] (Mikil Hills)\n***NC hills ([[Dima Hasao district|Dima Hasoa]])\n**Northeastern [[Mizoram]]\n***Metnathol Sielphai\n**[[Nagaland]]\n***[[Peren district]]\n***[[Dimapur district]]\n**[[Tripura]]\n*[[Myanmar]]\n**[[Sagaing Division]] (including [[Tamu, Myanmar|Tamu]])\n**[[Chin State]]\n\n==Dialects==\n''Ethnologue'' lists the following dialects of Thadou, the names of which mostly correspond to clan names.

He was the first son of [[Maharaja]] [[Rao Jodha]] of the Rathore clan, the founder of [[Jodhpur]] and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the [[Thar Desert]], Bikaner was considered an [[oasis]] on the trade route between [[Central Asia]] and the [[Gujarat]] coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (\"the settlement of Bika\") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5&nbsp;km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.<ref name=Ring>{{Cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|author2=Robert M.

During the [[Mughal Empire]]'s rule in the country, Raja Rai Singh accepted the [[suzerainty]] of the Mughals and held a high rank as an army general at the court of the Emperor [[Akbar]] and his son the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Rai Singh's successful military exploits, which involved winning half of [[Mewar|Mewar kingdom]] for the Empire, won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was given the [[jagir]]s (lands) of Gujarat and [[Burhanpur]]. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Chintamani Durg (Junagarh fort) on a plain which has an average elevation of {{convert|760|ft|m}}.

Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. Anup Singh Ji, who ruled from 1669 to 1698, made substantial additions to the fort complex, with new palaces and the [[Zenana]] quarter, a royal dwelling for women and children. He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup Mahal. Maharaja Gaj Singh, who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon Palace).\n\nDuring the 18th century, there was an internecine war between the rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also amongst other [[Thakur (Indian title)|thakurs]], which was put down by British troops.<ref name=history/>\n\nFollowing Maharaja Gaj Singh, Maharaja Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and lavishly decorated the audience hall (see illustration) with glass and lively paintwork.

He was the first son of [[Maharaja]] [[Rao Jodha]] of the Rathore clan, the founder of [[Jodhpur]] and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the [[Thar Desert]], Bikaner was considered an [[oasis]] on the trade route between [[Central Asia]] and the [[Gujarat]] coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (\"the settlement of Bika\") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5&nbsp;km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.<ref name=Ring>{{Cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|author2=Robert M.

During the [[Mughal Empire]]'s rule in the country, Raja Rai Singh accepted the [[suzerainty]] of the Mughals and held a high rank as an army general at the court of the Emperor [[Akbar]] and his son the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Rai Singh's successful military exploits, which involved winning half of [[Mewar|Mewar kingdom]] for the Empire, won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was given the [[jagir]]s (lands) of Gujarat and [[Burhanpur]]. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Chintamani Durg (Junagarh fort) on a plain which has an average elevation of {{convert|760|ft|m}}. He was an expert in arts and architecture, and the knowledge he acquired during his visits abroad is amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built at the Junagarh fort.<ref name=Ring/><ref name=history/><ref name=Juna>{{cite web|url=http://www.realbikaner.com/palace/junagarh/index.html|title=Junagarh Fort, Bikaner|accessdate=7 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416053153/http://www.realbikaner.com/palace/junagarh/index.html|archivedate=16 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nMaharaja Karan Singh, who ruled from 1631 to 1639, under the suzerainty of the Mughals, built the Karan Mahal palace. Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. Anup Singh Ji, who ruled from 1669 to 1698, made substantial additions to the fort complex, with new palaces and the [[Zenana]] quarter, a royal dwelling for women and children. He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup Mahal. Maharaja Gaj Singh, who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon Palace).\n\nDuring the 18th century, there was an internecine war between the rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also amongst other [[Thakur (Indian title)|thakurs]], which was put down by British troops.<ref name=history/>\n\nFollowing Maharaja Gaj Singh, Maharaja Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and lavishly decorated the audience hall (see illustration) with glass and lively paintwork.

In 1941, the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]] founded in his honor the [[Pr\u00eamio Machado de Assis]] (Machado de Assis Award), the most prestigious literary award in the country. For his innovation and audacity in early themes, Assis is often seen as a writer of unprecedented production, known for his irony and wide vocabulary. Assis' greatest works are ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), ''[[Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas]]'' (\"Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas\", also translated as ''Epitaph of a Small Winner'') and ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' (also known in English as ''Philosopher or Dog?''). Machado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature.

His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of [[Augusto dos Anjos]], another Brazilian writer.\nMachado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cervantes]]. Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in Western literature; this is based on United States's conceptions of race, which are [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|not the same in Brazil]],<ref>Daniel, pp. 10\u201376.</ref> where he is considered [[mulato]].<ref name=\"Daniel0\">Daniel (2012): \"As a mulatto, Machado experienced the ambiguity of racial identity throughout his life.\"</ref>\n\nHis works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), [[Helen Caldwell]] (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B.

New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 1990. xi\u2013xxiv.</ref>\n\nCritics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality\u2014but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as \"Romantic Realism.\"<ref name=\"daniel2\">Daniel, pp. 190\u2013237.</ref> In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an expos\u00e9 of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil.<ref>Daniel, pp. 153\u2013218.</ref> Schwarz,  argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.<ref name=\"daniel2\" />\n\nMachado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the ''Comiss\u00e3o Machado de Assis'' (\"Machado de Assis Commission\"), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages.

In 1897 he founded and became the first President of the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

In 1941, the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]] founded in his honor the [[Pr\u00eamio Machado de Assis]] (Machado de Assis Award), the most prestigious literary award in the country. For his innovation and audacity in early themes, Assis is often seen as a writer of unprecedented production, known for his irony and wide vocabulary. Assis' greatest works are ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), ''[[Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas]]'' (\"Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas\", also translated as ''Epitaph of a Small Winner'') and ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' (also known in English as ''Philosopher or Dog?''). Machado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature. Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in [[Western literature]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Birth and adolescence===\n[[File:Morro do Livramento, onde Machado nasceu.jpg|thumb|left|Morro do Livramento.

His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of [[Augusto dos Anjos]], another Brazilian writer.\nMachado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cervantes]]. Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in Western literature; this is based on United States's conceptions of race, which are [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|not the same in Brazil]],<ref>Daniel, pp. 10\u201376.</ref> where he is considered [[mulato]].<ref name=\"Daniel0\">Daniel (2012): \"As a mulatto, Machado experienced the ambiguity of racial identity throughout his life.\"</ref>\n\nHis works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), [[Helen Caldwell]] (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B.

New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 1990. xi\u2013xxiv.</ref>\n\nCritics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality\u2014but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as \"Romantic Realism.\"<ref name=\"daniel2\">Daniel, pp. 190\u2013237.</ref> In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an expos\u00e9 of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil.<ref>Daniel, pp. 153\u2013218.</ref> Schwarz,  argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.<ref name=\"daniel2\" />\n\nMachado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the ''Comiss\u00e3o Machado de Assis'' (\"Machado de Assis Commission\"), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages.
