The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit (state militia) in the newly organizing [[Union Army]] to suffer fatal casualties of dead and wounded in action during the Civil War in the [[Baltimore Riot of 1861|Baltimore Civil War Riot]] (aka \"Pratt Street Riots\") of April 19, 1861 (\"first bloodshed of the Civil War\"), and the second state militia unit to arrive in the national capital [[Washington D.C.]] in response to 16th President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] initial [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|call for 75,000 troops]]. Private [[Luther C. Ladd]] from [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the 6th Massachusetts is often referred to as the first [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier killed in action during the war, along with three other deaths and almost 40 wounded in the regiment's historic march.\n\nIn the years immediately preceding the war and during its first enlistment, the regiment consisted primarily of [[Company (military unit)|companies]] from [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] in the northeast of the \"Old Bay State\". During its first term of service of three periods, four out of ten companies of the regiment were from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Edward F. Jones]] commanded the regiment during its first term. He later commanded the [[26th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|26th Massachusetts]] and was awarded the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During its second and third terms of service, the unit was commanded by Colonel Albert S. Follansbee.\n\nThe regiment first enlisted for a \"90-day\" term of service which lasted from April 16 to August 2, 1861. Following their engagement in the waterfront Baltimore riot (also known in [[History of Maryland|Maryland]] as the \"Pratt Street Riots\"), the 6th Massachusetts proceeded to Washington camping out in the legislative chambers of the unfinished [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] and then returned north again to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] to fortifying artillery positions, placing the city under martial law anrossingd guarding locations within and surrounding the outskirts of the town as well as the vital [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station at Relay Junction near the crucial [[Thomas Viaduct]] over the upper [[Patapsco River]] near [[Elkridge, Maryland]]. Their second term of service lasted nine months from August 1862 to June 1863. During this time the 6th Massachusetts was attached to the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]] of the organizing [[Army of the Potomac]] (the major Federal force in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]]) and participated in several expeditions and actions in the vicinity of [[Suffolk, Virginia]], most notably in the [[Siege of Suffolk]] (southwest of [[Hampton Roads]] harbor and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]) and the [[Battle of Carrsville]] in April and May,  1863. Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt's bravery at Carrsville earned him the newly established Congressional [[Medal of Honor]]. The 6th Massachusetts served a third term in the fourth year of the War in response to the  emergency call for additional troops to defend fortifications around Washington and Baltimore during the third [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] invasion of the North led by Gen. [[Jubal Early]]. During this term, which lasted 100 days from July to October, 1864, the 6th Massachusetts [[garrison]]ed [[Fort C. F. Smith (Arlington, Virginia)|Fort C. F. Smith]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and guarded Confederate prisoners of war at [[Fort Delaware]] (below [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] near the mouth of the [[Delaware River]] above the [[Delaware Bay]]).\n\n==Earlier units==\nThe 6th Massachusetts regiment that served during the Civil War was formed in 1855 during the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia. Other units dating back to the 18th century were given the designation 6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia.{{sfnp|Hall|1900|p=168}} They were formed and disbanded at various times and although they shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during [[King George's War]] in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Siege of Louisbourg]] in 1745.{{sfnp|General Society of Colonial Wars|1896|p=xviii}} During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the [[6th Massachusetts Regiment]] was engaged in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]], the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]].{{sfnp|Carrington|1876|pp=221 and 336}}\n\n==90-day term of service==\n===Preparations===\n[[File:6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia departing Jersey City 1861.jpg|The 6th Massachusetts en route to Washington, April 18, 1861|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a long column of soldiers at a large train station preparing to board a train]]Shortly after [[South Carolina]] issued its [[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|Declaration of Secession]], Massachusetts Governor [[John A. Andrew]] anticipated imminent civil war and issued an order on January 16, 1861, to the ten existing Massachusetts units of peacetime militia to immediately reorganize and prepare for active service.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=58}} Colonel Edward F. Jones was the first militia commander to respond to the Governor's order. His letter indicating the regiment's readiness, dated January 21, was brought to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and read in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] by then state Senator [[Benjamin F. Butler]].{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=190}}\n\nOn April 15, 1861, three days after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces fired on [[Fort Sumter]], [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers]] to serve in putting down the insurrection. The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the existing regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], one from [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], two from [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=14}} That night, the men of the 6th Massachusetts barracked in [[Faneuil Hall|Faneuil]] and [[Boylston Hall (Boston)|Boylston Halls]].{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=77}} The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]], and another from [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total. Thus composed entirely of existing volunteer militia companies, the 6th Massachusetts was made up of volunteer soldiers.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=4}} The regiment proceed that day to the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]], where Governor Andrew presented regimental [[Colours, standards and guidons|colors]] to Colonel Jones. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston for Washington via railroad at 7 p.m. on April 17.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Baltimore Riot===\n[[File:6th Massachusetts Militia attacked in Baltimore 1861.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Mob attacks companies of the 6th Massachusetts Militia on Pratt Street during the Baltimore Riot.|alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a formation of militia soldiers with bayonets fixed surrounded by rioters]]On the Friday morning of April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts boarded the P.W.& B. Railroad train cars at the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] station in the early morning hours and departed for the national capital at Washington via Baltimore. Before the end of the day, the regiment saw combat during the Baltimore Riot. The date was also coincidentally, the 186th anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] near their home grounds outside Boston which began the [[American Revolution]] in April 1775.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=78}}\n\nAlthough Maryland remained in the Union, [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] sentiment and support for the Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of [[sabotage]] to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause [[derailment]] and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=131}}\n\nTrains passing through Baltimore at that time could not proceed directly through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at [[President Street Station]] on the east side of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails north up President Street for three blocks, then across the [[Jones Falls]] stream running south to the harbor. Then turning left going west for a mile along the waterfront piers of the then narrow alley-like rough cobblestoned paving of [[Pratt Street|East & West Pratt Street]], surrounded by tightly packed brick and wooden rowhouses with commercial maritime businesses, factories and offices. The railway cars (also known as \"carriages') moved each separately by horsepower to the  [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]] on the west side of Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]], where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}} The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=195}} The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:Ladd, Luther.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Private Ladd of the 6th Massachusetts was the first Union soldier killed in action during the Civil War.|alt=A sepia toned portrait photograph depicting the head and shoulders of a young man in an elaborate militia uniform.

The size of the crowd obstructing their path was estimated at roughly 10,000.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=196}} [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Follansbee, the senior captain, took charge of the detachment. After crossing the Pratt Street Bridge, which had been partially dismantled by the crowd, Follansbee ordered his men to march at the \"double-quick.\" This roused the crowd further as they perceived the quickened pace as an indication of panic. As well as stones and bricks being thrown, shots were now fired at the 6th Massachusetts from the stores and houses around them. Captain Follansbee gave the order to return fire.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nSeventeen-year-old Private Luther C. Ladd, a factory worker from Lowell, was hit in the head by a piece of scrap iron that was thrown from a rooftop and fractured his skull.{{sfnp|A citizen of Alexandria and an eye witness|1862|p=20}} As he staggered, one of the rioters took Ladd's musket from him and fired, wounding him in the leg.{{sfnp|Thorp|2011|}} Ladd died on Pratt Street.

Among the crowd was [[Clara Barton]] who became a famed nurse during the Civil War.

The next morning, tensions in Washington were high as rumors circulated of an impending Confederate attack. After reviewing the 6th Massachusetts, Lincoln expressed his anxiety to the members of the regiment, telling them, \"I don't believe there is any North. The Seventh Regiment [New York] is a myth. Rhode Island is not known in our geography any longer. You are the only northern realities.\"{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=59}}{{sfnp|Goodwin|2005|p=354}}\n\nIn the days and weeks after the Baltimore Riot, newspapers and politicians across the country drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, at the start of the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=60}} Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those [[Minutemen]] who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the \"Minutemen of '61.\"{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=193}}\n\nThe 6th Massachusetts remained in Washington until May 5, when they were assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station about 15 miles outside of Baltimore at [[Elkridge, Maryland|Elkridge]].{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}} Their presence there helped keep open the crucial rail line from the northeastern states to Washington.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=61}}\nThe regiment returned to Baltimore on May 13, when [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city with several Union regiments in anticipation of a Confederate attack on Baltimore which never developed. The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]], where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge relay station. They served out the majority of their term at the relay station and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\nThe regiment's return to Boston at the close of their 90-day term was delayed slightly by special request of Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. In light of the recent Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], in which the 6th Massachusetts did not participate, he asked the regiment voluntarily remain at Elkridge another week in the event of a Confederate advance on Washington. On July 29, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to break camp and boarded trains for Boston which was reached on August 1. The regiment was mustered out on August 2, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\n==9-month term of service==\n===Organization and departure===\nThe regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven of the ten original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was necessary in order to fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=161}} To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=142}} Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at [[Camp Chase (Massachusetts)|Camp Henry Wilson]] in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship ''Plymouth Rock.'' Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=148}}{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=162}}\n\n===Blackwater River expeditions===\n[[File:Five soldiers in Union uniforms of the 6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Five soldiers of the 6th Massachusetts during their second term of service, photo likely taken in camp near Suffolk, Virginia|alt=A sepia toned photograph of five soldiers standing at parade rest in a neat line]] Upon reaching Washington, the regiment was ordered to [[Fortress Monroe]] and from there to [[Suffolk, Virginia]]. The 6th Massachusetts was assigned to the Second Brigade (commanded by Colonel [[Robert Sanford Foster|Robert S. Foster]]) of the First Division of the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]].{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}} They served garrison and [[Picket (military)|picket]] duty in the vicinity of Suffolk, occasionally taking part in reconnaissance expeditions to the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River]] (which represented the boundary between the Union occupied counties of southeast Virginia and Confederate territory of the interior) and engaged in minor skirmish actions.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=163}}\n\nTheir first such expedition took place on October 3, 1862, about two weeks after the regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the [[Joint Expedition against Franklin|Expedition against Franklin]], a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near [[Western Branch, Virginia|Western Branch Church]], far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets for the first time in action.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=171}} Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=81}} During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near [[Zuni, Virginia]] and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment\u20142nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=190}} The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the [[Battle of Deserted House]] in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}} The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=203}}\n\n===Siege of Suffolk===\nThe majority of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front of the defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|pp=79\u201380}} This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn early 1863, Major General [[James Longstreet]] was given command of the Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His objectives were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the [[Siege of Suffolk]] on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position on the right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the [[Nansemond River]]. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}}\n\nOn May 3, 1863, Longstreet abandoned the siege and began moving his forces north to rejoin the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent in pursuit of the retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the [[Somerton Historic District|Somerton]] Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=184}}\n\n===Battle of Carrsville and Medal of Honor recipient===\nMajor General [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]], commanding Union forces at Suffolk, conducted several reconnaissances in force  to determine the disposition of Confederate forces remaining in the region. On May 13, the 6th Massachusetts joined another expedition to the Blackwater River. This was the final action of their second term of service. The column was commanded by Major General Foster and Colonel Follansbee was promoted to command of the [[brigade]] to which the 6th Massachusetts belonged.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=238}} A considerable Confederate force attacked the Union expedition in a sharp engagement on May 14\u201315, 1863, known as the [[Battle of Carrsville]] or the Battle of Holland House. During this fight, the 6th Massachusetts supported the 7th Massachusetts Battery and exchanged in heavy, prolonged firing with the Confederates. The 6th Massachusetts made an advance, driving the enemy into the woods, then were driven back and made a second counter-attack, reclaiming their position at the start of the battle. The regiment suffered casualties of five killed or mortally wounded, twelve wounded and five prisoners.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn the middle of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C perceived that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to pull them out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. In this action, he earned the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, \"When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner.\" Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nOn May 18, the 6th Massachusetts and other regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted in support of artillery at [[Windsor, Virginia]]. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed in front of the State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=165}} In all during their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}}\n\n==100-day term of service==\n[[File:United States bonds; or Duress by federal authority- a journal of current events during an imprisonment of fifteen months, at Fort Delaware (1874) (14759557101).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|At Fort Delaware, Union guards (unit unidentified) \"perambulating\" a group of Confederate prisoners around the island|alt=A lithograph of a large column of soldiers without weapons in disorderly dress marching outside a large stone fort being guarded by a few soldiers in dark uniforms holding rifles]]In May 1864, Major General  [[Ulysses S. Grant]] removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the [[Army of the Potomac]]. To man defenses around the capital in their place, and to relieve regiments at various northern fortifications, Lincoln issued a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days. This measure would allow enough time to raise longer-term regiments to occupy rearward defenses. The 6th Massachusetts was activated for a third time in response to this call for 100-day regiments.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=297}}\n\nThe regiment organized at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], just outside of Boston beginning July 13, 1864. Colonel Follansbee again commanded the regiment. The roster of field and staff officers was fundamentally the same as their previous nine-month term of service.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=166}} They departed on July 20 for Washington, reaching the city on July 22. They were posted on [[Arlington Heights Historic District|Arlington Heights]] in [[Fort C. F. Smith (Arlington, Virginia)|Fort C.F. Smith]]. Their month of service there was mundane, consisting of regular drills, inspections and fatigue duty.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=298}}\n\nOn August 21, 1864, the regiment was ordered to move. They traveled by rail to Philadelphia and by steamship to [[Fort Delaware]] on [[Pea Patch Island]] on the [[Delaware River]]. The regiment relieved the [[157th Ohio Infantry]] and commenced garrison and guard duty over the 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war held at Fort Delaware.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=167}} There had been widespread instances of mistreatment of prisoners by Union units that previously garrisoned the fort, including abuse and theft of prisoners' property. Members of the 6th Massachusetts condemned these practices and generally refrained from similar abuses.{{sfnp|Temple|2003|p=113}} Their duty consisted of standing post and escorting prisoners on various work details. The fort was large and in excellent condition. The barracks were newly constructed, comfortable, and included a library and other amenities. The field and staff officers as well as several company officers were joined by their wives and children at the post. The regimental historian recorded that many members of the unit remember their time at Fort Delaware as extremely pleasant.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=301}}\n\nOn October 19, 1864, the 6th Massachusetts was relieved and began the journey back to Boston, which they reached on October 21. The regiment reported to Camp Meigs on October 27, 1864, and were mustered out for the third and last time. During their third term, the regiment lost 10 men to disease.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}}\n\n==Sumner Needham memorial==\nOn the 3d of May, 1861 the body of Sumner Needham was conveyed to Lawrence by a Committee of the City Government, and placed in the City Hall, where it was appropriately draped; the seats were filled; and every inch of standing room was occupied.

An appropriation of $2,000 was secured from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a further $2,700 was provided by the city. The monument was constructed in front of the Lowell courthouse in what is now known as Monument Square. Ladd and Whitney had both been buried in the [[Lowell Cemetery]]. On April 28, 1865, their remains were re-interred in a vault beneath the monument. The monument was to be dedicated on April 19, 1865, on the anniversary of the Baltimore Riot, but the ceremonies were delayed due to the [[assassination of President Lincoln]]. It was instead dedicated on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a local holiday, June 17, 1865. The procession numbered more than 4,500 people. Governor Andrew gave the oration acknowledging the men whom he called \"the first martyrs of the great rebellion.\"{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|pp=343\u2013344}}\n\n==Later units==\nThe 6th Massachusetts continued as a peacetime militia unit following the Civil War, typically meeting for annual musters at various camps in Massachusetts. During reorganizations of the Massachusetts militia in 1866 and 1877, the 6th Massachusetts was consolidated and some of its companies disbanded or transferred, but the regimental organization remained intact.{{sfnp|Hall|1900|pp=198 and 203}} The regiment was again activated during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].

The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit (state militia) in the newly organizing [[Union Army]] to suffer fatal casualties of dead and wounded in action during the Civil War in the [[Baltimore Riot of 1861|Baltimore Civil War Riot]] (aka \"Pratt Street Riots\") of April 19th, 1861 (\"first bloodshed of the Civil War\"), and the second state militia unit to arrive in the national capital [[Washington D.C.]] in response to 16th President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] initial [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|call for 75,000 troops]]. Private [[Luther C. Ladd]] from [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the 6th Massachusetts is often referred to as the first [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier killed in action during the war, along with three other deaths and almost 40 wounded in the regiment's historic march.\n\nIn the years immediately preceding the war and during its first enlistment, the regiment consisted primarily of [[Company (military unit)|companies]] from [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] in the northeast of the \"Old Bay State\". During its first term of service of three periods, four out of ten companies of the regiment were from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Edward F. Jones]] commanded the regiment during its first term. He later commanded the [[26th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|26th Massachusetts]] and was awarded the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During its second and third terms of service, the unit was commanded by Colonel Albert S. Follansbee.\n\nThe regiment first enlisted for a \"90-day\" term of service which lasted from April 16 to August 2, 1861. Following their engagement in the waterfront Baltimore riot (also known in [[History of Maryland|Maryland]] as the \"Pratt Street Riots\"), the 6th Massachusetts proceeded to Washington camping out in the legislative chambers of the unfinished [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] and then returned north again to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] to fortifying artillery positions, placing the city under martial law anrossingd guarding locations within and surrounding the outskirts of the town as well as the vital [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station at Relay Junction near the crucial [[Thomas Viaduct]] over the upper [[Patapsco River]] near [[Elkridge, Maryland]]. Their second term of service lasted nine months from August 1862 to June 1863. During this time the 6th Massachusetts was attached to the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]] of the organizing [[Army of the Potomac]] (the major Federal force in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]]) and participated in several expeditions and actions in the vicinity of [[Suffolk, Virginia]], most notably in the [[Siege of Suffolk]] (southwest of [[Hampton Roads]] harbor and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]) and the [[Battle of Carrsville]] in April and May,  1863. Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt's bravery at Carrsville earned him the newly established Congressional [[Medal of Honor]]. The 6th Massachusetts served a third term in the fourth year of the War in response to the  emergency call for additional troops to defend fortifications around Washington and Baltimore during the third [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] invasion of the North led by Gen.

The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the existing regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], one from [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], two from [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=14}} That night, the men of the 6th Massachusetts barracked in [[Faneuil Hall|Faneuil]] and [[Boylston Hall (Boston)|Boylston Halls]].{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=77}} The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]], and another from [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total.

Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of [[sabotage]] to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause [[derailment]] and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=131}}\n\nTrains passing through Baltimore at that time could not proceed directly through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at [[President Street Station]] on the east side of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails north up President Street for three blocks, then across the [[Jones Falls] stream running south to the harbor. Then turning left going west for a mile along the waterfront piers of the then narrow alley-like rough cobblestoned paving of [[Pratt Street|East & West Pratt Street]], surrounded by tightly packed brick and wooden rowhouses with commercial maritime businesses, factories and offices. The railway cars (also known as \"carriages') moved each separately by horsepower to the  [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]]]] on the west side of Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]], where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}} The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks.

Butler occupied the city with several Union regiments in anticipation of a Confederate attack on Baltimore which never developed. The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]], where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge relay station. They served out the majority of their term at the relay station and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\nThe regiment's return to Boston at the close of their 90-day term was delayed slightly by special request of Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. In light of the recent Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], in which the 6th Massachusetts did not participate, he asked the regiment voluntarily remain at Elkridge another week in the event of a Confederate advance on Washington. On July 29, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to break camp and boarded trains for Boston which was reached on August 1. The regiment was mustered out on August 2, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\n==9-month term of service==\n===Organization and departure===\nThe regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven of the ten original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was necessary in order to fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=161}} To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=142}} Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at [[Camp Chase (Massachusetts)|Camp Henry Wilson]] in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship ''Plymouth Rock.'' Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington.

The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the [[Joint Expedition against Franklin|Expedition against Franklin]], a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near [[Western Branch, Virginia|Western Branch Church]], far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets for the first time in action.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=171}} Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=81}} During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near [[Zuni, Virginia]] and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment\u20142nd Lieutenant Robert G.

This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front of the defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|pp=79\u201380}} This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn early 1863, Major General [[James Longstreet]] was given command of the Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His objectives were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the [[Siege of Suffolk]] on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position on the right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the [[Nansemond River]]. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}}\n\nOn May 3, 1863, Longstreet abandoned the siege and began moving his forces north to rejoin the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent in pursuit of the retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the [[Somerton Historic District|Somerton]] Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=184}}\n\n===Battle of Carrsville and Medal of Honor recipient===\nMajor General [[John Adams Dix|John A.

On May 13, the 6th Massachusetts joined another expedition to the Blackwater River. This was the final action of their second term of service. The column was commanded by Major General Foster and Colonel Follansbee was promoted to command of the [[brigade]] to which the 6th Massachusetts belonged.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=238}} A considerable Confederate force attacked the Union expedition in a sharp engagement on May 14\u201315, 1863, known as the [[Battle of Carrsville]] or the Battle of Holland House. During this fight, the 6th Massachusetts supported the 7th Massachusetts Battery and exchanged in heavy, prolonged firing with the Confederates. The 6th Massachusetts made an advance, driving the enemy into the woods, then were driven back and made a second counter-attack, reclaiming their position at the start of the battle. The regiment suffered casualties of five killed or mortally wounded, twelve wounded and five prisoners.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn the middle of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C perceived that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to pull them out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. In this action, he earned the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, \"When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner.\" Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nOn May 18, the 6th Massachusetts and other regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted in support of artillery at [[Windsor, Virginia]]. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed in front of the State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=165}} In all during their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}}\n\n==100-day term of service==\n[[File:United States bonds; or Duress by federal authority- a journal of current events during an imprisonment of fifteen months, at Fort Delaware (1874) (14759557101).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|At Fort Delaware, Union guards (unit unidentified) \"perambulating\" a group of Confederate prisoners around the island|alt=A lithograph of a large column of soldiers without weapons in disorderly dress marching outside a large stone fort being guarded by a few soldiers in dark uniforms holding rifles]]In May 1864, Major General  [[Ulysses S.

The film was directed by [[Tony Randel]], who also co-wrote the script with Peter Atkins, and stars [[Gary Daniels]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Isako Washio]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]]. A [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the film was produced by [[Toei Video]] which featured the cast of the 1980s anime television series reprising their roles.\n\nThe film, which loosely adapts the first story arc of the original manga, centers on [[Kenshiro|Ken]] (Daniels), the lone master of the \"[[Hokuto Shinken|North Star]]\" martial art school, who wanders the post-apocalyptic Earth in search of his nemesis Lord Shin, the man who killed his master and kidnapped his fiancee. Meanwhile, Shin rules as dictator of the city of Southern Cross with his personal army known as the Crossmen, who are given orders to hunt down Kenshiro.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the aftermath of [[World War III]], the world has plunged into anarchy and chaos. Water is scarce and what is left of the human race scrounges for survival. Two opposing martial arts schools, North Star and Southern Cross, both devoted to bringing order to the world, were previously thrown into disarray after Southern Cross adept Shin turned against his masters and summarily executed North Star master Ryuken, leaving his son Kenshiro as the sole heir to the North Star. Shin then sought Kenshiro himself, defeated him and left him for dead after carving his chest with seven scars in the shape of the [[Big Dipper]]. Shin also abducted Kenshiro's fiancee and their shared love interest Julia, segregating her in his tower. Since then, Shin rules the land with an iron fist through a militia called the Crossmen, led by Jackal, a ruthless henchman whose bulging head is held in leather bandages after Kenshiro disfigured him in an earlier fight.\n\nBack in the current time, Kenshiro, who survived Shin's aggression, wanders the wasteland aimlessly. After killing a gang led by bandit Zeed, who attacked the homestead that had given him shelter for the night, Kenshiro continues on towards the town of Paradise Valley, home to one of the few remaining sources of pure water. There, he meets orphan siblings Bat and Lynn. After using a pressure point technique to restore Lynn's sight, which she lost after watching her parents murdered by Crossmen, Kenshiro departs, ignoring Lynn's plea to remain and protect them. Bat follows Kenshiro to talk him into joining the organized resistance against the Crossmen's incursions, to no avail.\n\nThe Crossmen raid Paradise Valley and occupy it, commandeering the well. Jackal orders Lynn's execution for sedition, but halts it after she threateningly mentions Kenshiro, taking her prisoner instead to extort Kenshiro's whereabouts. As Lynn's screams from afar ring inside Kenshiro's head, Kenshiro turns back: he and Bat infiltrate the occupied town and free Lynn, but Bat is mortally wounded in a fight against Jackal. Kenshiro spares Jackal and sends him back to Shin to announce his arrival.\n\nBy Shin's order, Jackal takes Julia to the tower's basement to hide her from Kenshiro. There, he engages in a [[cat-and-mouse game]] in an attempt to rape and kill Julia. Kenshiro breaks into Shin's tower and confronts him in the throne room. As Kenshiro gains the upper hand in the ensuing showdown, Shin lies about Julia's fate and takes advantage of Kenshiro's shock to overpower him. However, after noticing a bud that has sprouted from a seed he had given Julia long before, Kenshiro regains hope and defeats Shin, killing him. After freeing herself from Jackal by removing his bandages and causing his head to swell and explode, Julia rejoins Kenshiro. The surviving Crossmen bow to Kenshiro and Julia in deference.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Daniels]] as [[Kenshiro]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Lord Shin\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Jackal\n* [[Isako Washio]] as Julia\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Asher\n* [[Downtown Julie Brown]] as Charlie\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Bat\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Paul McCarthy\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Stalin\n* [[Big Van Vader]] as Goliath\n* Paulo Tocha as Stone\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Ryuken\n* Nalona Herron as Lynn\n* Bill Nagel as Miner\n* Andre Rosey Brown as Sandman\n* Rowena Guinness as Jill McCarthy\n* Michael Charles Friedman as Neuter\n* Nils Allen Stewart as Zeed\n* [[Tony Halme]] as Kemp\n* [[David \"Shark\" Fralick]] as Man at Palace\n* [[George Kee Cheung]] as Neville\n* [[Michael Franco]] as AWOL Crossman A\n* David Loo as AWOL Crossman B\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Woman\n* [[Chris DeRose]] as Oswald\n* [[Darryl Chan]] as Novack\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Jenny\n* Kate Geer as Mother\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was not reviewed by many mainstream critics, and it got mixed reviews from fans and online critics.

It was on the northern shoreline (just above the high-water mark) of [[Tulare Lake]], then potentially the largest freshwater body of water in the US, outside of the Great Lakes.{{efn|The maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current highway 41. On that map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and Lemoore Naval Air Station would have been on the west bank of the northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size. By 1892, the shoreline is shown five miles to the south of Lemoore.  It is presumed that by \"original lake line\" Thompson meant the still discernible high water line, and that this is near the elevation of the natural spillway and marks the maximum size of Tulare Lake during flood years. According to Google Earth map elevations, the current physical \"spillway\" would be north-west of Lemoore at the intersection of Grangeville Blvd. and 24th at elevation 213 or 214 feet at the natural \"ridge\" or \"dam\" top separating the San Joaquin River watershed from the Kings River drainage. The nearby remnant stream ''oxbows'' of Bogg Slough marks the natural, pre-dammed start of the Fresno Slough. However, current elevations (and the spillway's location) may have changed due to land subsidence reportedly caused in nearby areas by ground water pumping. Because the land is so flat, just a few feet in changed elevation can translate to more than a mile in distance.}} The American pioneers from eastern states saw this as a stretch of vast virgin land on which sheep, horses and wild animals had grazed but had never been cultivated.\n\nBy the time Dr. Moore arrived, scores of individual farms dotted the landscape, but as Tulare Lake retreated, more became continually available. The soil was rich and productive as it had been brought down and deposited for centuries from the high [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] by the Kings River and the [[Los Gatos Creek (Fresno County, California)|Los Gatos Creek]] [[alluvial fan]] from the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Range]]. Wells were easy to dig, as the water level was unusually high. So water was plentiful for irrigation from shallow wells farm families installed. Raising of sheep and grains were principal concerns of farmers in the area.\n\nHowever, the pioneers were somewhat isolated, since they had to drive by horse as far as {{Convert|6|miles}} northeast to [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville settlement]], to get mail or newspapers. It was even farther to [[Kingston, California|Kingston]] for other supplies. Hanford was not founded until later in 1877. Even the area was called by various names, believed to be of Indian origin, such as Latache, Tailholt, or just, in English, the Lake District.\n\nDr. Lee Moore proved to be a man of vision. He decided to knit together the scores of surrounding farm families, to secure a post office, and some local center for conducting business which could be hastened by direct means of communicating with the outside world. He must also have had the hope of attracting the railroad, which was then being planned but was not built until six years later.\n\nThe first steps he took to organize a community began in early 1872, when he surveyed a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} subdivision in what is now the land immediately west of the present Lemoore High School. In August 1872 he had established the first real estate development in this district and had laid out and named the streets after other pioneer families. In the summer of 1872 land auctions were held and lots went to the highest bidder. Prices ranged from $75 to $150 per lot. One business lot was sold for $600, rated as a very high price, considering the value of the dollar in 1872. Dr. Moore's home was believed to be situated where the grammar school playground on Bush Street is now located.\n\nThe year 1872 was a busy one for the inhabitants. In addition to sales at the subdivision and putting in of streets, new buildings for homes and businesses began to arise. This was the start of a real community, but it still lacked a school, a definitely accepted name, and a post office.\n\nAll these developed in the next eventful year of 1873. Dr. Moore had presented a signed petition to the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office Department]] in distant [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] for a post office in the new town in 1872, but his petition was not granted until 1873.\n\nAt that time it was common custom to name communities after their founders or some prominent person of the day. The naming of Hanford and [[Porterville, California|Porterville]] are examples of this common practice.\n\nThe Lemoore post office first opened in 1875.<ref name=CGN />\n\nFor some reason the U.S. Post Office objected to the name \"Latache,\" so,by about the 1920s it combined the founder's name by omitting one letter \"e\",from Lee and called the new post office Lemoore after Lee Moore. In that way the new community received its new name.\n\nIn the same year, 1873, a Mr. Armstrong donated {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land for the first school building in Lemoore. It was a frame structure {{Convert|18|feet}} by {{convert|30|ft|m}}, completed and dedicated at a [[country dance]] held in December 1873.\n\nThe railroad came to what is now Kings County in 1877. At that date Grangeville was the largest community in the entire area. After some dispute with its residents, rail officials decided to by-pass that settlement and went through Hanford. Lemoore, by that time had shown healthy growth. It could have been through the foresight of Dr. Moore in setting a head-start in '72 which attracted the rail route to his budding community. The line was put through Lemoore in 1877 parallel to Front Street, now called E Street.\n\nThis re-directed the business growth of the town toward the railroad station from where Dr. Moore first encouraged residence and business activity. It eventually made E (Front Street) and D Streets the main business avenues of the community.\n\nAfter 25 years of service to the Lemoore area, Dr. Lee Moore died on September 11, 1898. The number of new residents he had helped bring into the world numbered in the thousands.\n\nIn 1883 the town then had a flouring mill of 200 barrels daily capacity. It was an important shipping point for wheat and wool, and not long afterwards became a center for fruit, but in its early period many fires retarded its growth.\n\nMany of the early settlers of the Lemoore District were cultured people, and Lemoore attained a reputation for literary and musical accomplishments unmatched by many pioneer towns. There was an early literary society that had a long and noteworthy existence.\n\nIn 1893 Tulare County, by act of the State Legislature, was split into two areas. Western Tulare County became what is now Kings County. In creating the new County of Kings there was keen competition between Hanford and Lemoore as to which would become the county seat. By that time Hanford's population had exceeded Lemoore's and the addition of the Santa Fe Railroad's main line through Hanford gave it the advantage of two rail lines instead of one. The result was the construction of the County Courthouse in that city.\n\nLemoore became an [[Municipal corporation|incorporated city]] on 4 July 1900, which opened a new era for the community, with government by an elected City Council. Lemoore residents have always taken a keen interest in local political activities.\n\nBob E. Baldock designed and opened for play in 1928 a 9-hole [[golf course]]. The City of Lemoore had it remodeled in 1991, by Bill Phillips to add to the community an exciting 18-hole golf course.\n\n===Military===\n\nIn 1941, the Lemoore Army Air Field opened as an [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] training field. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] acquired {{Convert|1466|acre|}} for the Lemoore Basic Flying School in 1941\u201342. Approximately {{Convert|488|acre|}} were acquired by grant deed from individual land owners, {{Convert|963|acre|}} were leased from the City of Lemoore and {{Convert|14|acre|}} were acquired by transfer from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|National Housing Agency]]. In 1961, The Army Air Field was converted into what is now [[Naval Air Station Lemoore]], a [[Naval Aviation]] base 7 miles west of Lemoore. Since 1961, The base has grown to become the largest [[Master Jet Base]] in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. NAS Lemoore hosts five carrier air wings, mostly made up of [[F-18]]s and [[F-35]] jets.\n\n==Geography==\nThe maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current intersection of [[State Route 41]] and [[State Route 198]]. On Thompson's map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and about five miles away [[Naval Air Station Lemoore|Lemoore Naval Air Station]] would have been on the west bank of the pointy northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size.  At the extreme northern point of Tulare Lake was its natural, occasional \"flood year\" spillway northbound into Bogg Slough, [[Fresno Slough]], and the [[San Joaquin River]]'s watershed, onward to the sea at [[San Francisco Bay]]. The present (2014) remaining marshy remnants of Bogg Slough, with its unfarmed [[oxbow lake|''oxbow'']] structures may be the last of their kind to avoid the plow in the Kings-San Joaquin river system.  This \"summit,\" or spillway is located just a few miles north-west of Lemoore, off Grangeville Blvd at elevation {{Convert|210|feet}}.<ref>U.S. Geologic Survey: STRUCTURAL CONTROL OF INTERIOR DRAINAGE, SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA By George H. Davis and J. H. Green, Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif.  \"The low point of [[Tulare Lake]] Bed is 178 feet above sea level; the divide to the north is 210 feet above sea level\" ... \"During periods of high runoff, Tulare Lake would fill to an elevation of 210 feet and would discharge north to the San Joaquin River and thence to the Pacific Ocean. Playas or salt flats did not form because through-flowing water periodically flushed out accumulated salt.\" ... \"Two principal explanations have been advanced to account for the interior drainage of the southern San Joaquin Valley. One advocated by Mendenhall and others (1916, p. 21), W. M. Davis (1933, p. 224), Hinds (1952, p. 150), and many others explains the interior drainage as due to damming of the valley by the growth of the alluvial fans of the Kings River from the east and Los Gatos Creek from the west. The other explanation suggests that Tulare Lake Bed is the site of a structural downwarp and that active tectonic subsidence is the cause of the topographic depression (G. H. Davis and others, 1939, p. 29).\"</ref> The spillway was wide, shallow and confusing, choked with tall [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule rushes]], and without observable landmarks. Only one commercial boat is known to have sailed from [[Tulare Lake]] to the San Francisco delta.  [[Tulare Lake]] had huge economic importance in the region, both for the very large population of Indians, and the white pioneers.  The lake supported a large commercial fishery feeding San Francisco, and a steam powered ferry servicing several towns and settlements.  The receding lake continually opened up new agricultural lands for settlement.  Because of its source streams being diverted, the last time the lake overflowed was 1878, and today it no longer exists.\n\nBecause the natural summit or border between the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] basin and the San Joaquin River's watershed, and the Kings River itself nearly intersect near Lemoore, a number of huge water works that control regional water flow are also located nearby.  For example, in flood years the Kings River is diverted west into the so-called \"[[North Fork Kings River]],\" to Crescent Weir and related major levees eastward to the north-flowing Fresno Slough and to the sea, preventing a resurgence (\"flooding\") of [[Tulare Lake]] to the south. This \"switch point\" is located just north of Lemoore right off of Highway 41 and Elgin Ave at the New Island Weirs.  In many cases the prehistoric Kings River bed has been obliterated and new channels have been constructed. However, as of 2014, in satellite images (such as Google maps, etc.) the remains of many of the old channels can still be detected.\n\nOther towns built just above the [[Tulare Lake]] high-water shoreline include [[Kettleman City]] and [[Alpaugh]] (once also called Hog Island, Root Island, and Atwell's Island<ref>Historic Tulare County: A Sesquicentennial History, 1852-2002, By Chris Brewer, page 28</ref>). Satellite maps indicate that highways, railroads, and property lines are aligned with the historic lake shores. Also, many of the farms can be seen to be much larger within its various historic shore lines than in the surrounding areas.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Lemoore has a [[semi-arid climate]], abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=20747&cityname=Lemoore%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Lemoore, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 463\n|1890= 651\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 1355\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1711\n|1950= 2153\n|1960= 2561\n|1970= 4219\n|1980= 8832\n|1990= 13622\n|2000= 19712\n|2010= 24531\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26474\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0641152|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715075250/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0641152|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Lemoore city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Lemoore had a population of 24,531.

It was on the northern shoreline (just above the high-water mark) of [[Tulare Lake]], then potentially the largest freshwater body of water in the US, outside of the Great Lakes.{{efn|The maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current highway 41. On that map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and Lemoore Naval Air Station would have been on the west bank of the northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size. By 1892, the shoreline is shown five miles to the south of Lemoore.  It is presumed that by \"original lake line\" Thompson meant the still discernible high water line, and that this is near the elevation of the natural spillway and marks the maximum size of Tulare Lake during flood years. According to Google Earth map elevations, the current physical \"spillway\" would be north-west of Lemoore at the intersection of Grangeville Blvd. and 24th at elevation 213 or 214 feet at the natural \"ridge\" or \"dam\" top separating the San Joaquin River watershed from the Kings River drainage. The nearby remnant stream ''oxbows'' of Bogg Slough marks the natural, pre-dammed start of the Fresno Slough. However, current elevations (and the spillway's location) may have changed due to land subsidence reportedly caused in nearby areas by ground water pumping. Because the land is so flat, just a few feet in changed elevation can translate to more than a mile in distance.}} The American pioneers from eastern states saw this as a stretch of vast virgin land on which sheep, horses and wild animals had grazed but had never been cultivated.\n\nBy the time Dr. Moore arrived, scores of individual farms dotted the landscape, but as Tulare Lake retreated, more became continually available. The soil was rich and productive as it had been brought down and deposited for centuries from the high [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] by the Kings River and the [[Los Gatos Creek (Fresno County, California)|Los Gatos Creek]] [[alluvial fan]] from the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Range]]. Wells were easy to dig, as the water level was unusually high. So water was plentiful for irrigation from shallow wells farm families installed. Raising of sheep and grains were principal concerns of farmers in the area.\n\nHowever, the pioneers were somewhat isolated, since they had to drive by horse as far as {{Convert|6|miles}} northeast to [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville settlement]], to get mail or newspapers. It was even farther to [[Kingston, California|Kingston]] for other supplies. Hanford was not founded until later in 1877. Even the area was called by various names, believed to be of Indian origin, such as Latache, Tailholt, or just, in English, the Lake District.\n\nDr. Lee Moore proved to be a man of vision. He decided to knit together the scores of surrounding farm families, to secure a post office, and some local center for conducting business which could be hastened by direct means of communicating with the outside world. He must also have had the hope of attracting the railroad, which was then being planned but was not built until six years later.\n\nThe first steps he took to organize a community began in early 1872, when he surveyed a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} subdivision in what is now the land immediately west of the present Lemoore High School. In August 1872 he had established the first real estate development in this district and had laid out and named the streets after other pioneer families. In the summer of 1872 land auctions were held and lots went to the highest bidder. Prices ranged from $75 to $150 per lot. One business lot was sold for $600, rated as a very high price, considering the value of the dollar in 1872. Dr. Moore's home was believed to be situated where the grammar school playground on Bush Street is now located.\n\nThe year 1872 was a busy one for the inhabitants. In addition to sales at the subdivision and putting in of streets, new buildings for homes and businesses began to arise. This was the start of a real community, but it still lacked a school, a definitely accepted name, and a post office.\n\nAll these developed in the next eventful year of 1873. Dr. Moore had presented a signed petition to the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office Department]] in distant [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] for a post office in the new town in 1872, but his petition was not granted until 1873.\n\nAt that time it was common custom to name communities after their founders or some prominent person of the day. The naming of Hanford and [[Porterville, California|Porterville]] are examples of this common practice.\n\nThe Lemoore post office first opened in 1875.<ref name=CGN />\n\nFor some reason the U.S. Post Office objected to the name \"Latache,\" so,by about the 1920s it combined the founder's name by omitting one letter \"e\",from Lee and called the new post office Lemoore after Lee Moore. In that way the new community received its new name.\n\nIn the same year, 1873, a Mr. Armstrong donated {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land for the first school building in Lemoore. It was a frame structure {{Convert|18|feet}} by {{convert|30|ft|m}}, completed and dedicated at a [[country dance]] held in December 1873.\n\nThe railroad came to what is now Kings County in 1877. At that date Grangeville was the largest community in the entire area. After some dispute with its residents, rail officials decided to by-pass that settlement and went through Hanford. Lemoore, by that time had shown healthy growth. It could have been through the foresight of Dr. Moore in setting a head-start in '72 which attracted the rail route to his budding community. The line was put through Lemoore in 1877 parallel to Front Street, now called E Street.\n\nThis re-directed the business growth of the town toward the railroad station from where Dr. Moore first encouraged residence and business activity. It eventually made E (Front Street) and D Streets the main business avenues of the community.\n\nAfter 25 years of service to the Lemoore area, Dr. Lee Moore died on September 11, 1898. The number of new residents he had helped bring into the world numbered in the thousands.\n\nIn 1883 the town then had a flouring mill of 200 barrels daily capacity. It was an important shipping point for wheat and wool, and not long afterwards became a center for fruit, but in its early period many fires retarded its growth.\n\nMany of the early settlers of the Lemoore District were cultured people, and Lemoore attained a reputation for literary and musical accomplishments unmatched by many pioneer towns. There was an early literary society that had a long and noteworthy existence.\n\nIn 1893 Tulare County, by act of the State Legislature, was split into two areas. Western Tulare County became what is now Kings County. In creating the new County of Kings there was keen competition between Hanford and Lemoore as to which would become the county seat. By that time Hanford's population had exceeded Lemoore's and the addition of the Santa Fe Railroad's main line through Hanford gave it the advantage of two rail lines instead of one. The result was the construction of the County Courthouse in that city.\n\nLemoore became an [[Municipal corporation|incorporated city]] on 4 July 1900, which opened a new era for the community, with government by an elected City Council. Lemoore residents have always taken a keen interest in local political activities.\n\nBob E. Baldock designed and opened for play in 1928 a 9-hole [[golf course]]. The City of Lemoore had it remodeled in 1991, by Bill Phillips to add to the community an exciting 18-hole golf course.\n\n===Military===\n\nIn 1941, the Lemoore Army Air Field opened as an [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] training field. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] acquired {{Convert|1466|acre|}} for the Lemoore Basic Flying School in 1941\u201342. Approximately {{Convert|488|acre|}} were acquired by grant deed from individual land owners, {{Convert|963|acre|}} were leased from the City of Lemoore and {{Convert|14|acre|}} were acquired by transfer from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|National Housing Agency]]. In 1961, The Army Air Field was converted into what is now [[Naval Air Station Lemoore]], a [[Naval Aviation]] base 7 miles west of Lemoore. Since 1961, The base has grown to become the largest [[Master Jet Base]] in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. NAS Lemoore hosts five carrier air wings, mostly made up of [[F-18]]s and [[F-35]] jets.\n\n==Geography==\nThe maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current intersection of [[State Route 41]] and [[State Route 198]]. On Thompson's map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and about five miles away [[Naval Air Station Lemoore|Lemoore Naval Air Station]] would have been on the west bank of the pointy northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size.  At the extreme northern point of Tulare Lake was its natural, occasional \"flood year\" spillway northbound into Bogg Slough, [[Fresno Slough]], and the [[San Joaquin River]]'s watershed, onward to the sea at [[San Francisco Bay]]. The present (2014) remaining marshy remnants of Bogg Slough, with its unfarmed [[oxbow lake|''oxbow'']] structures may be the last of their kind to avoid the plow in the Kings-San Joaquin river system.  This \"summit,\" or spillway is located just a few miles north-west of Lemoore, off Grangeville Blvd at elevation {{Convert|210|feet}}.<ref>U.S. Geologic Survey: STRUCTURAL CONTROL OF INTERIOR DRAINAGE, SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA By George H. Davis and J. H. Green, Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif.  \"The low point of [[Tulare Lake]] Bed is 178 feet above sea level; the divide to the north is 210 feet above sea level\" ... \"During periods of high runoff, Tulare Lake would fill to an elevation of 210 feet and would discharge north to the San Joaquin River and thence to the Pacific Ocean. Playas or salt flats did not form because through-flowing water periodically flushed out accumulated salt.\" ... \"Two principal explanations have been advanced to account for the interior drainage of the southern San Joaquin Valley. One advocated by Mendenhall and others (1916, p. 21), W. M. Davis (1933, p. 224), Hinds (1952, p. 150), and many others explains the interior drainage as due to damming of the valley by the growth of the alluvial fans of the Kings River from the east and Los Gatos Creek from the west. The other explanation suggests that Tulare Lake Bed is the site of a structural downwarp and that active tectonic subsidence is the cause of the topographic depression (G. H. Davis and others, 1939, p. 29).\"</ref> The spillway was wide, shallow and confusing, choked with tall [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule rushes]], and without observable landmarks. Only one commercial boat is known to have sailed from [[Tulare Lake]] to the San Francisco delta.  [[Tulare Lake]] had huge economic importance in the region, both for the very large population of Indians, and the white pioneers.  The lake supported a large commercial fishery feeding San Francisco, and a steam powered ferry servicing several towns and settlements.  The receding lake continually opened up new agricultural lands for settlement.  Because of its source streams being diverted, the last time the lake overflowed was 1878, and today it no longer exists.\n\nBecause the natural summit or border between the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] basin and the San Joaquin River's watershed, and the Kings River itself nearly intersect near Lemoore, a number of huge water works that control regional water flow are also located nearby.  For example, in flood years the Kings River is diverted west into the so-called \"[[North Fork Kings River]],\" to Crescent Weir and related major levees eastward to the north-flowing Fresno Slough and to the sea, preventing a resurgence (\"flooding\") of [[Tulare Lake]] to the south. This \"switch point\" is located just north of Lemoore right off of Highway 41 and Elgin Ave at the New Island Weirs.  In many cases the prehistoric Kings River bed has been obliterated and new channels have been constructed. However, as of 2014, in satellite images (such as Google maps, etc.) the remains of many of the old channels can still be detected.\n\nOther towns built just above the [[Tulare Lake]] high-water shoreline include [[Kettleman City]] and [[Alpaugh]] (once also called Hog Island, Root Island, and Atwell's Island<ref>Historic Tulare County: A Sesquicentennial History, 1852-2002, By Chris Brewer, page 28</ref>). Satellite maps indicate that highways, railroads, and property lines are aligned with the historic lake shores. Also, many of the farms can be seen to be much larger within its various historic shore lines than in the surrounding areas.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Lemoore has a [[semi-arid climate]], abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=20747&cityname=Lemoore%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Lemoore, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 463\n|1890= 651\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 1355\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1711\n|1950= 2153\n|1960= 2561\n|1970= 4219\n|1980= 8832\n|1990= 13622\n|2000= 19712\n|2010= 24531\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26474\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0641152|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715075250/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0641152|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Lemoore city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Lemoore had a population of 24,531.

This classification was overturned by a ''[[Conseil d'\u00c9tat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]'' ruling in a lawsuit brought by associations supporting [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[family values]].\n\nSome movies are forbidden to minors under 18, without the X rating, like ''[[Baise-moi]]'', ''[[Ken Park]]'' or ''[[Saw III|Saw 3]]'', so that these movies can be viewed in theaters and not attract VAT.\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe constitution and law are very strict about [[hardcore pornography]], especially when compared to very liberal laws about [[softcore pornography]], [[prostitution]] and [[sex shop]]s. Supplying hardcore pornography to people who are less than 18 years old is an offence, and shops selling it must keep people under the age of 18 from entering their premises. If only a part of the shop is dedicated to pornography, it must be completely closed off from the rest of the premises. Alternatively, shops may choose not to display their goods or advertise that they sell them, in which case minors may be admitted. Websites hosting pornographic material within Germany must comply with very strict rules about verifying that viewers are over 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/BGH-reicht-Check-der-Ausweisnummer-als-Zugangshuerde-fuer-Online-Pornos-nicht-aus--/meldung/97651|title=BGH reicht Check der Ausweisnummer als Zugangsh\u00fcrde f\u00fcr Online-Pornos nicht aus|first=Stefan|last=Krempl|date=19 October 2007|work=heise.de|accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nSoft porn is less restricted, and may even be broadcast on TV at night.
