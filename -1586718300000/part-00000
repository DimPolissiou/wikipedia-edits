At this point, a person relies not on what they ''think'' should be the next move, but what is their trained natural reaction (or instinct) or what is ''felt'' intuitively.

Other sources indicate May 6, 1942, in which case he would have been born in Uspenca, Romania.</ref> in [[Uspenkova]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Soviet Union]].\n\nHe went to high school in [[Pite\u015fti]] and graduated from the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of [[English language|English Language]].  Chiriac made his radio debut in 1963, with the show ''Jazz of Yesterday and Today'', later ''Jazz magazin''. Beginning on July 10, 1967, he produced for Radio Rom\u00e2nia the most popular music show of its day, ''Metronom''. Together with Geo Limb\u0103\u015fanu, he presented listeners with the latest information from the pop, rock and jazz scenes. Shortly after the August 21, 1968, [[Prague Spring|Invasion of Czechoslovakia]] (in which Romania did not participate) he played a ballad by [[Mircea Florian (musician)|Mircea Florian]] which relates how five small wolves and a bigger one attacked a sheepfold, and later put on [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" According to his nephew, \"everything came to an end one evening\" when he played the song, \"which had escaped the censor, who didn't know English. But the song was heard on the show by the wrong people and was banned in 1969\", also leading to ''Metronom''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s cancellation that year.\n\nFrom adolescence he developed a passion for jazz, gathering all the information he could about jazz musicians and listening to jazz songs wherever he could. In his notebooks he copied books, chronicles, interviews and news from specialty magazines. His aunt later recalled, \"In high school music was his only preoccupation. He wasted nights writing. In the morning he would wake up with great difficulty to go to school.\"<ref name=\"Hurdubaia\">Hurdubaia.</ref> Some of the notebooks ended up in the possessions of important Romanian musicians, such as [[Radu Maltopol]], [[Cristian Colan]] and [[Johnny R\u0103ducanu]], being the only possible source for ready information about jazz at the time.\n \n[[Image:FondatoriiFEJ.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Founding members of the European Jazz Federation (October 15\u201316, 1967). Chiriac is second from left.]]\nChiriac wrote press articles as well as liner notes for the ''Jazz'' collection. In 1965, he published a study of jazz in the magazine ''Secolul XX''; a year later, he wrote the preface for the Romanian edition of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ''My Life in New Orleans''. He was a founding member of the European Jazz Federation in 1967. According to the minutes, he described the difficult conditions of Romanian jazz musicians at the time and accepted the idea of a federation under [[UNESCO]] protection. He said the federation should focus on creating a jazz academy, a bureau for international concerts and a centre where audio and TV recordings could be exchanged.\n\nA great jazz aficionado, Chiriac would copy entire discs onto tapes and arrange them in the station archive. Aurel Gherghel later said, \"The station's whole archive was written and arranged by Cornel Chiriac.\" In 1969, Chiriac organised and advertised the first national jazz festival in Romania, held in [[Ploie\u015fti]]. He also arranged for the songs played during the festival to be recorded.\n\nAs a producer, he especially backed the [[Timi\u0219oara]] band [[Transsylvania Phoenix|Phoenix]] and the [[Bucharest]] band [[Sideral (band)|Sideral]]. He completed important recordings with the former in Radio Rom\u00e2nia's studio (1968\u201369) and promoted them on different occasions. In 1969, took steps to bring them to the [[Golden Stag Festival]], managing to include them in the lineup. Coincidentally, [[Cliff Richard]], who eight years earlier had played in ''[[The Young Ones (1961 film)|The Young Ones]]'', a film that inspired many Romanian rock bands, was scheduled to sing there. Meanwhile, the Phoenix members were staying at Bucharest's Hotel Nord so the censors could watch them. During the festival, Chiriac returned from [[Bra\u015fov]] with the bad news that Phoenix' concert had been cancelled, but returned hoping to resolve the problem ''in extremis''. Unable to convince the organisers, in protest, he locked himself in his hotel room and set fire to the curtains. The hotel employees and firemen broke down the door to stop the blaze, while Chiriac disappeared during the commotion, taking with him just the tapes with Phoenix.\n\n==At Radio Free Europe==\n[[Image:CornelChiriacREL.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cornel Chiriac in the RFE studio]]\nA few days later, he managed to leave Romania and arrived in [[Austria]] with the help of a falsified invitation (received during the Bra\u015fov festival and having as its initial destination [[Poland]]). He spent some time at the [[Traiskirchen refugee camp]], where he was discovered by [[Radio Free Europe]] director [[No\u00ebl Bernard (journalist)|No\u00ebl Bernard]]. After getting his official documents in order, he continued his activity in Munich, in RFE's [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] section. He re-launched ''Metronom'', ''Jazz magazin'' and started a third show, ''Jazz \u00e0 la carte''. At first, Chiriac used his microphone to express the anger he felt against those who had hindered his work at Radio Rom\u00e2nia. [[Ioana M\u0103gur\u0103 Bernard]] later recalled: \"Often, after doing something without thinking, Cornel had such problems with the German authorities and with the American heads of RFE that he was almost kicked out of Germany and off radio\".<ref name=\"Hurdubaia\"/> Later, according to No\u00ebl Bernard, \"he realised that not politics but music was his calling\". Until his death, his musical activity was rich, and included a Romanian translation of the [[rock opera]] ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.\n\nOn March 4, 1975, near midnight, Chiriac was stabbed near his car, in a Munich parking lot. An hour later, a female student returning home found him. The first suspect to be arrested was 17-year-old Mario Gropp, the last person seen with Chiriac that evening. In Romania, there was talk of a political assassination committed by the [[Securitate]]. Chiriac's body was cremated in Munich and his ashes brought back to Romania by his mother. He is buried in Bucharest's Re\u00eenvierea Cemetery.\n\n==Legacy==\nJournalists later recalled that his murder was greeted with sadness in Bucharest. Alexandru Sipa organised a soir\u00e9e at the [[Bra\u015fov]] jazz club, ''in memoriam''. In Bucharest, Phoenix was in the [[Electrecord]] studio, recording the album ''Cantofabule''. Octavian Ursulescu said in an interview, \"The news that a good friend to all of us, Cornel Chiriac, had been assassinated, came to us in the Tomis studio; we all cried like children...\"\n\nOn February 24, 1995, the Cornel Chiriac Jazz Club opened in Ploie\u015fti.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{in lang|ro}} Cristina Hurdubaia, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_5530/cine_l_a_injunghiat_pe_emil_georgescu_.html \"Cine l-a \u00eenjunghiat pe Emil Georgescu?\" (\"Who Stabbed Emil Georgescu?\")], in ''[[Jurnalul Na\u0163ional]]'', February 2, 2004\n*Nicolae Covaci \u2014 ''Phoenix \u00eens\u0103 eu...'', Editura Nemira, Bucharest, 1994.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cornel-chiriac.org/ Cornel Chiriac Homepage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070708201314/http://www.radio3net.ro/halloffame/index.php Cornel Chiriac at Radio3net]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070305114821/http://interioare.free.fr/Cornel%20Chiriac/Cornel%20Chiriac%20-%20Biografie.html Cornel Chiriac at Interioare]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515064309/http://www.internationaljazzfederation.org/IJF/IJFHistory1.html]\n* [http://nmion.chez-alice.fr/ Site about Chiriac]\n* [http://www.srf.ch/player/radio/passage/audio/lost-in-music-\u2013-die-cornel-chiriac-story?id=dad923da-0c14-40e0-9a27-cc5c16682afc Lost in Music-The Cornel Chiriac Story]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chiriac, Cornel}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:People murdered in Germany]]\n[[Category:Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty people]]\n[[Category:Romanian defectors]]\n[[Category:Romanian jazz musicians]]\n[[Category:Romanian journalists]]\n[[Category:Romanian people murdered abroad]]\n[[Category:Romanian radio personalities]]\n[[Category:University of Bucharest alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Sarata Raion]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Cornelchiriac.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cornel Chiriac in the studio]]\n'''Cornel Chiriac''' (May 8, 1941<ref>According to his declarations.
