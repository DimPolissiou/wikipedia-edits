They were largely replaced by the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] during the great [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]]. These peoples originated from the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]]s of eastern and central Africa. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century. People speaking languages ancestral to the current [[Sotho languages|Sotho]] and [[Nguni languages]] began settling no later than the 11th century.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\"/>\n\n===Swazi settlers (18th and 19th centuries)===\nThe Swazi settlers, then known as ''the Ngwane'' (or ''bakaNgwane'') before entering Eswatini, had been settled on the banks of the [[Pongola River]]. Before that, they were settled in the area of the Tembe River near present-day [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. Continuing conflict with the [[Ndwandwe]] people pushed them further north, with [[Ngwane III]] establishing his capital at Shiselweni at the foot of the Mhlosheni hills.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\"/>\n\nUnder [[Sobhuza I]], the Ngwane people eventually established their capital at [[Zombodze]] in the heartland of present-day Eswatini. In this process, they conquered and incorporated the long-established clans of the country known to the Swazi as ''Emakhandzambili''.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\">Bonner, Philip (1983).

''KaNgwane'', named for Ngwane III, is an alternative name for Eswatini, the surname of whose [[dynasty|royal house]] remains ''Nkhosi [[House of Dlamini|Dlamini]]''. ''Nkhosi'' literally means \"king\". Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Eswatini, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The ''Emakhandzambili'' clans were initially incorporated into the kingdom with wide [[autonomy]], often including grants of special [[ritual]] and political status. The extent of their autonomy, however, was drastically curtailed by Mswati, who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\" />\n\nWith his power, Mswati greatly reduced the influence of the ''Emakhandzambili'' while incorporating more people into his kingdom either through conquest or by giving them refuge. These later arrivals became known to the Swazis as ''Emafikamuva''. The clans who accompanied the Dlamini kings were known as the ''Bemdzabuko'' or ''true Swazi''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Johnston, W. and A.K. - South African Republic. Orange Free State, Natal, Basuto Land, Etc..jpg|thumb|right|In this map of Southern Africa from 1896, Eswatini is labelled as \"SWAZILAND\"]]\n\nThe autonomy of the Swazi nation was influenced by British and Dutch rule of southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881, the British government signed a convention recognising Swazi independence despite the [[Scramble for Africa]] that was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognised in the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBecause of controversial land/mineral rights and other concessions, Swaziland had a [[Triumvirate|triumviral]] administration in 1890 following the death of King [[Mbandzeni]] in 1889. This government represented the British, the Dutch republics, and the Swazi people. In 1894, a convention placed Swaziland under the [[South African Republic]] as a [[protectorate]]. This continued under the rule of [[Ngwane V]] until the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKing Ngwane V died in December 1899, during [[incwala]], after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. His successor, [[Sobhuza II]], was four months old. Swaziland was indirectly involved in the war with various skirmishes between the British and the Boers occurring in the country until 1902.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===British rule over Swaziland (1906\u20131968)===\nIn 1903, after the British victory in the Second Boer War, Swaziland became a [[British protectorate]]. Much of its early administration (for example, postal services) was carried out from South Africa until 1906 when the [[Transvaal Colony]] was granted self-government. Following this, Swaziland was partitioned into European and non-European (or native reserves) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land. Sobhuza's official coronation was in December 1921 after the regency of [[Labotsibeni Mdluli|Labotsibeni]], after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in London in 1922 regarding the issue of the land.<ref name=Vail91>{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Leroy|title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520074203|pages=295\u2013296|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X4VmAWdXPD0C&dq=Sobhuza+deputation+london}}</ref>\n\nIn the period between 1923 and 1963, Sobhuza II established the Swazi Commercial Amadoda which was to grant licences to small businesses on the Swazi reserves and also established the Swazi National School to counter the dominance of the missions in education. His stature grew with time and the Swazi royal leadership was successful in resisting the weakening power of the British administration and the incorporation of Swaziland into the [[Union of South Africa]].<ref name=Vail91 />\n\nThe constitution for independent Swaziland was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 under the terms of which legislative and executive councils were established. This development was opposed by the Swazi National Council (''liqoqo''). Despite such opposition, elections took place and the first ''Legislative Council of Swaziland'' was constituted on 9 September 1964. Changes to the original constitution proposed by the Legislative Council were accepted by Britain and a new constitution providing for a House of Assembly and Senate was drawn up. Elections under this constitution were held in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Independence (1968\u2013present)===\nFollowing the 1967 elections, Swaziland was a protected state until independence was regained in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/56/enacted?view=plain|title=Swaziland Independence Act 1968|website=legislation.gov.uk|access-date=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the elections of 1973, the constitution of Swaziland was suspended by King Sobhuza II who thereafter ruled the country by [[decree]] until his death in 1982.

Public protests by civic organisations and [[Trade union|trade unions]] became more common. Starting in 2012, improvements in SACU receipts have eased the fiscal pressure on the Swazi government. A new parliament, the second since promulgation of the constitution, was elected on 20 September 2013.

In turn, this leads to desertification, increased food insecurity and reduced river flows. Despite being responsible for a negligible portion of total global greenhouse gas emissions Eswatini is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

[[Land tenure|Title Deed]] Lands (TDLs), where the bulk of high value crops are grown (sugar, forestry, and citrus) are characterised by high levels of investment and irrigation, and high productivity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAbout 75% of the population is employed in [[subsistence agriculture]] upon [[Swazi Nation Land]] (SNL). In contrast with the commercial farms, Swazi Nation Land suffers from low productivity and investment. This dual nature of the Swazi economy, with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialised agricultural TDLs on the one hand, and declining productivity subsistence agriculture (on SNL) on the other, may well explain the country's overall low growth, high inequality and unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEconomic growth in Eswatini has lagged behind that of its neighbours. Real GDP growth since 2001 has averaged 2.8%, nearly 2 percentage points lower than growth in other [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) member countries. Low agricultural productivity in the SNLs, repeated droughts, the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS and an overly large and inefficient government sector are likely contributing factors. Eswatini's public finances deteriorated in the late 1990s following sizeable surpluses a decade earlier. A combination of declining revenues and increased spending led to significant budget deficits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Central bank swazi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Central Bank in Mbabane]]\n\nThe considerable spending did not lead to more growth and did not benefit the poor.  Much of the increased spending has gone to current expenditures related to wages, transfers, and subsidies.  The wage bill today constitutes over 15% of GDP and 55% of total public spending; these are some of the highest levels on the African continent.  The recent rapid growth in SACU revenues has, however, reversed the fiscal situation, and a sizeable surplus was recorded since 2006. [[SACU]] revenues today account for over 60% of total government revenues.  On the positive side, the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years, and domestic debt is almost negligible; external debt as a percent of GDP was less than 20% in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's economy is very closely linked to the [[economy of South Africa]], from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports. Eswatini's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]&nbsp;\u2013 AGOA&nbsp;\u2013 to the US) and for sugar (to the EU).  Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment.  Textile exports grew by over 200% between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50% over the same period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Southern African Customs Union.svg|thumb|Eswatini is part of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (green).]]\n\nThe continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles, the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries, and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market. Eswatini will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment. A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe recently concluded Investment Climate Assessment provides some positive findings in this regard, namely that Eswatini firms are among the most productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, although they are less productive than firms in the most productive middle-income countries in other regions. They compare more favourably with firms from lower middle income countries, but are hampered by inadequate governance arrangements and infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's currency, the [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]], is pegged to the [[South African rand]], subsuming Eswatini's monetary policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union, which may equal as much as 70% of government revenue this year, and worker [[remittance]]s from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. Eswatini is not poor enough to merit an [[IMF]] programme; however, the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for [[foreign direct investment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Society==\n\n===Demographics===\n{{main|Demographics of Eswatini}}\n[[File:Swaziland-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Eswatini's population in thousands (1961\u20132013)]]\n\nThe majority of Eswatini's population is ethnically [[Swazi people|Swazi]], mixed with a small number of [[Zulus|Zulu]] and [[White Africans]], mostly people of British and [[Afrikaner]] descent. Traditionally Swazi have been [[subsistence farmers]] and herders, but most now mix such activities with work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and African refugees from [[Mozambique]].

In a polygamous homestead, each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences. There are three structures for sleeping, cooking, and storage (brewing beer). In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors' quarters and guest accommodation.\n\nCentral to the traditional homestead is the cattle [[byre]], a circular area enclosed by large logs, interspaced with branches. The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige. It contains sealed grain pits. Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.\n\nThe headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often [[polygamous]]. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.\n\nThe [[Sangoma]] is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called \"kwetfwasa\". At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various purposes, such as determining the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on \"kubhula\", a process of communication, through trance, with the natural superpowers. The [[Inyanga]] (a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill (\"kushaya ematsambo\") used to determine the cause of the sickness.\n\nThe most important cultural event in Eswatini is the [[Incwala]] ceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as \"first fruits ceremony\", but the King's tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as \"Kingship Ceremony\": when there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is [[high treason]] for any other person to hold an Incwala.\n\nEvery Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors ([[induna]]s), the chiefs, the regiments, and the \"bemanti\" or \"water people\".\n\nEswatini's most well-known cultural event is the annual [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga Reed Dance]]. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds and present them to the queen mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls' chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen mother, and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be \"induna\" (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King's daughters will be her counterpart.\n\nThe Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old \"[[umchwasho]]\" custom. In \"umchwasho\", all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the [[Sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] of \"umchwasho\" until 19 August 2005.\n\nEswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per ''TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study'', February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\">\nFile:Princess Swaziland 015.jpg|Princess [[Sikhanyiso Dlamini]] at the [[Reed Dance|reed dance (umhlanga)]] festival\nFile:Swaziland - Traditional homes.jpg|A traditional Swazi homestead\nFile:Swazi Warriors.jpg|Swazi warriors at the [[incwala]] ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Africa}}\n* [[Index of Eswatini-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Eswatini]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in Eswatini]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=eSwatini|voy=Swaziland|c=Category:Swaziland|n=Category:Swaziland|v=no|b=no|s=Portal:Swaziland}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|wz|Eswatini}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090521105240/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/swaziland.htm Swaziland] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* {{curlie|Regional/Africa/Swaziland}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303 eSwatini] from the [[BBC News]]\n* {{wikiatlas|Eswatini}}\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=SZ Key Development Forecasts for Swaziland] from [[International Futures]]\n* [http://www.gov.sz/ Government of Eswatini]\n* [http://www.thekingdomofeswatini.com/ Welcome to Eswatini | The Kingdom of Eswatini] (Official Eswatini tourism website)\n\n{{Swaziland topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n | title =Related articles \n | list =\n{{Southern African Development Community}}\n{{African Union}}\n{{Commonwealth of Nations}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n{{Somali Plate}}\n{{Monarchies |collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Eswatini| ]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Swaziland]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth monarchies]]\n[[Category:Countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:English-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Kingdoms]]\n[[Category:Landlocked countries]]\n[[Category:Member states of the African Union]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Southern African countries]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1968]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Landlocked kingdom in southern Africa}}\n{{Use Commonwealth English|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n<!--\n*** Don't edit this article to change the name of the country to Swaziland without reading the consensus on this article's talk page first.

They were largely replaced by the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] during the great [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]]. These peoples originated from the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]]s of eastern and central Africa. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century.

Before that, they were settled in the area of the Tembe River near present-day [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. Continuing conflict with the [[Ndwandwe]] people pushed them further north, with [[Ngwane III]] establishing his capital at Shiselweni at the foot of the Mhlosheni hills.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\"/>\n\nUnder [[Sobhuza I]], the Ngwane people eventually established their capital at [[Zombodze]] in the heartland of present-day Eswatini.

''KaNgwane'', named for Ngwane III, is an alternative name for Eswatini, the surname of whose [[dynasty|royal house]] remains ''Nkhosi [[House of Dlamini|Dlamini]]''. ''Nkhosi'' literally means \"king\". Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Eswatini, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The ''Emakhandzambili'' clans were initially incorporated into the kingdom with wide [[autonomy]], often including grants of special [[ritual]] and political status. The extent of their autonomy, however, was drastically curtailed by Mswati, who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\" />\n\nWith his power, Mswati greatly reduced the influence of the ''Emakhandzambili'' while incorporating more people into his kingdom either through conquest or by giving them refuge. These later arrivals became known to the Swazis as ''Emafikamuva''. The clans who accompanied the Dlamini kings were known as the ''Bemdzabuko'' or ''true Swazi''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Johnston, W. and A.K. - South African Republic. Orange Free State, Natal, Basuto Land, Etc..jpg|thumb|right|In this map of Southern Africa from 1896, Eswatini is labelled as \"SWAZILAND\"]]\n\nThe autonomy of the Swazi nation was influenced by British and Dutch rule of southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881, the British government signed a convention recognising Swazi independence despite the [[Scramble for Africa]] that was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognised in the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBecause of controversial land/mineral rights and other concessions, Swaziland had a [[Triumvirate|triumviral]] administration in 1890 following the death of King [[Mbandzeni]] in 1889. This government represented the British, the Dutch republics, and the Swazi people. In 1894, a convention placed Swaziland under the [[South African Republic]] as a [[protectorate]]. This continued under the rule of [[Ngwane V]] until the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKing Ngwane V died in December 1899, during [[incwala]], after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. His successor, [[Sobhuza II]], was four months old. Swaziland was indirectly involved in the war with various skirmishes between the British and the Boers occurring in the country until 1902.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===British rule over Swaziland (1906\u20131968)===\nIn 1903, after the British victory in the Second Boer War, Swaziland became a [[British protectorate]]. Much of its early administration (for example, postal services) was carried out from South Africa until 1906 when the [[Transvaal Colony]] was granted self-government. Following this, Swaziland was partitioned into European and non-European (or native reserves) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land. Sobhuza's official coronation was in December 1921 after the regency of [[Labotsibeni Mdluli|Labotsibeni]], after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in London in 1922 regarding the issue of the land.<ref name=Vail91>{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Leroy|title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520074203|pages=295\u2013296|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X4VmAWdXPD0C&dq=Sobhuza+deputation+london}}</ref>\n\nIn the period between 1923 and 1963, Sobhuza II established the Swazi Commercial Amadoda which was to grant licences to small businesses on the Swazi reserves and also established the Swazi National School to counter the dominance of the missions in education. His stature grew with time and the Swazi royal leadership was successful in resisting the weakening power of the British administration and the incorporation of Swaziland into the [[Union of South Africa]].<ref name=Vail91 />\n\nThe constitution for independent Swaziland was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 under the terms of which legislative and executive councils were established. This development was opposed by the Swazi National Council (''liqoqo''). Despite such opposition, elections took place and the first ''Legislative Council of Swaziland'' was constituted on 9 September 1964.

The seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere with December being mid-summer and June mid-winter. Generally speaking, rain falls mostly during the summer months, often in the form of thunderstorms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWinter is the dry season. Annual rainfall is highest on the Highveld in the west, between {{convert|1000|and|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} depending on the year. The further east, the less rain, with the Lowveld recording {{convert|500|to|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per annum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nVariations in temperature are also related to the altitude of the different regions. The Highveld temperature is temperate and seldom uncomfortably hot, while the Lowveld may record temperatures around {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in summer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe average temperatures at Mbabane, according to season:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Spring || September\u2013October || {{convert|18|\u00b0C|1}}\n|-\n| Summer || November\u2013March || {{convert|20|\u00b0C}}\n|-\n| Autumn || April\u2013May || {{convert|17|\u00b0C|1}}\n|-\n| Winter || June\u2013August || {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}}\n|}\n\n===Climate change===\nClimate change in Eswatini is mainly evident in changing precipitation - including variability, persistent drought and heightened storm intensity. In turn, this leads to desertification, increased food insecurity and reduced river flows. Despite being responsible for a negligible portion of total global greenhouse gas emissions Eswatini is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The government of Eswatini has expressed concern that climate change is exacerbating existing social challenges such as poverty, a high HIV prevalence and food insecurity and will drastically restrict the country's ability to develop, as per Vision 2022.<ref>https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Eswatini%20First/Eswatini%27s%20INDC.pdf Retrieved 5 March 2020</ref> Economically, climate change has already adversely impacted Eswatini. For instance, the 2015-2016 drought decreased sugar and soft drink concentrate production export (Eswatini's largest economic export). Many of Eswatini's major exports are raw, agricultural products and are therefore vulnerable to a changing climate.<ref>https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Eswatini%20First/Eswatini%27s%20INDC.pdf Retrieved 5 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Eswatini}}\n{{See also|Category: Flora of Swaziland}}\n[[File:\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 - Grewia villosa.jpg|thumb|''[[Grewia villosa]]'']]\n\nThere are known to be [[List of birds of Swaziland|507 bird species]] in Eswatini, including 11 globally threatened species and four introduced species, and [[List of mammals of Swaziland|107 mammal species]] endemic to Eswatini, including the critically endangered [[South-central black rhinoceros]] and seven other endangered or vulnerable species.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[Protected areas of Eswatini]] include seven nature reserves, four frontier conservation areas and three wildlife or game reserves. [[Hlane Royal National Park]], the largest park in Eswatini, is rich in bird life, including [[white-backed vulture]]s, [[White-headed vulture|white-headed]], [[Lappet-faced vulture|lappet-faced]] and [[Cape vulture]]s, raptors such as [[martial eagle]]s, [[bateleur]]s, and [[long-crested eagle]]s, and the southernmost nesting site of the [[marabou stork]].<ref name=\"bgp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biggameparks.org/3parks_hlane.html|title=Hlane Royal National Park|work=biggameparks.org|publisher=Big Game Parks|accessdate=8 October 2009|location=Malkerns, Swaziland}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Eswatini}}\n[[File:Swaziland treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Swazi exports]]\n\nEswatini's economy is diverse, with agriculture, [[forestry]] and mining accounting for about 13% of GDP, manufacturing (textiles and sugar-related processing) representing 37% of GDP and services&nbsp;\u2013 with government services in the lead&nbsp;\u2013 constituting 50% of GDP. [[Land tenure|Title Deed]] Lands (TDLs), where the bulk of high value crops are grown (sugar, forestry, and citrus) are characterised by high levels of investment and irrigation, and high productivity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAbout 75% of the population is employed in [[subsistence agriculture]] upon [[Swazi Nation Land]] (SNL). In contrast with the commercial farms, Swazi Nation Land suffers from low productivity and investment. This dual nature of the Swazi economy, with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialised agricultural TDLs on the one hand, and declining productivity subsistence agriculture (on SNL) on the other, may well explain the country's overall low growth, high inequality and unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEconomic growth in Eswatini has lagged behind that of its neighbours. Real GDP growth since 2001 has averaged 2.8%, nearly 2 percentage points lower than growth in other [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) member countries. Low agricultural productivity in the SNLs, repeated droughts, the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS and an overly large and inefficient government sector are likely contributing factors. Eswatini's public finances deteriorated in the late 1990s following sizeable surpluses a decade earlier. A combination of declining revenues and increased spending led to significant budget deficits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Central bank swazi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Central Bank in Mbabane]]\n\nThe considerable spending did not lead to more growth and did not benefit the poor.  Much of the increased spending has gone to current expenditures related to wages, transfers, and subsidies.  The wage bill today constitutes over 15% of GDP and 55% of total public spending; these are some of the highest levels on the African continent.  The recent rapid growth in SACU revenues has, however, reversed the fiscal situation, and a sizeable surplus was recorded since 2006. [[SACU]] revenues today account for over 60% of total government revenues.  On the positive side, the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years, and domestic debt is almost negligible; external debt as a percent of GDP was less than 20% in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's economy is very closely linked to the [[economy of South Africa]], from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports. Eswatini's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]&nbsp;\u2013 AGOA&nbsp;\u2013 to the US) and for sugar (to the EU).  Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment.  Textile exports grew by over 200% between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50% over the same period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Southern African Customs Union.svg|thumb|Eswatini is part of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (green).]]\n\nThe continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles, the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries, and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market. Eswatini will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment. A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe recently concluded Investment Climate Assessment provides some positive findings in this regard, namely that Eswatini firms are among the most productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, although they are less productive than firms in the most productive middle-income countries in other regions. They compare more favourably with firms from lower middle income countries, but are hampered by inadequate governance arrangements and infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's currency, the [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]], is pegged to the [[South African rand]], subsuming Eswatini's monetary policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union, which may equal as much as 70% of government revenue this year, and worker [[remittance]]s from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. Eswatini is not poor enough to merit an [[IMF]] programme; however, the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for [[foreign direct investment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Society==\n\n===Demographics===\n{{main|Demographics of Eswatini}}\n[[File:Swaziland-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Eswatini's population in thousands (1961\u20132013)]]\n\nThe majority of Eswatini's population is ethnically [[Swazi people|Swazi]], mixed with a small number of [[Zulus|Zulu]] and [[White Africans]], mostly people of British and [[Afrikaner]] descent. Traditionally Swazi have been [[subsistence farmers]] and herders, but most now mix such activities with work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and African refugees from [[Mozambique]]. Christianity in Eswatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices.

Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.\n\nThe headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often [[polygamous]]. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.\n\nThe [[Sangoma]] is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called \"kwetfwasa\". At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various purposes, such as determining the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on \"kubhula\", a process of communication, through trance, with the natural superpowers. The [[Inyanga]] (a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill (\"kushaya ematsambo\") used to determine the cause of the sickness.\n\nThe most important cultural event in Eswatini is the [[Incwala]] ceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as \"first fruits ceremony\", but the King's tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as \"Kingship Ceremony\": when there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is [[high treason]] for any other person to hold an Incwala.\n\nEvery Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors ([[induna]]s), the chiefs, the regiments, and the \"bemanti\" or \"water people\".\n\nEswatini's most well-known cultural event is the annual [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga Reed Dance]]. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds and present them to the queen mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls' chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen mother, and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be \"induna\" (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King's daughters will be her counterpart.\n\nThe Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old \"[[umchwasho]]\" custom. In \"umchwasho\", all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the [[Sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] of \"umchwasho\" until 19 August 2005.\n\nEswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per ''TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study'', February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\">\nFile:Princess Swaziland 015.jpg|Princess [[Sikhanyiso Dlamini]] at the [[Reed Dance|reed dance (umhlanga)]] festival\nFile:Swaziland - Traditional homes.jpg|A traditional Swazi homestead\nFile:Swazi Warriors.jpg|Swazi warriors at the [[incwala]] ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Africa}}\n* [[Index of Eswatini-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Eswatini]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in Eswatini]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=eSwatini|voy=Swaziland|c=Category:Swaziland|n=Category:Swaziland|v=no|b=no|s=Portal:Swaziland}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|wz|Eswatini}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090521105240/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/swaziland.htm Swaziland] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* {{curlie|Regional/Africa/Swaziland}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303 eSwatini] from the [[BBC News]]\n* {{wikiatlas|Eswatini}}\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=SZ Key Development Forecasts for Swaziland] from [[International Futures]]\n* [http://www.gov.sz/ Government of Eswatini]\n* [http://www.thekingdomofeswatini.com/ Welcome to Eswatini | The Kingdom of Eswatini] (Official Eswatini tourism website)\n\n{{Swaziland topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n | title =Related articles \n | list =\n{{Southern African Development Community}}\n{{African Union}}\n{{Commonwealth of Nations}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n{{Somali Plate}}\n{{Monarchies |collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Eswatini| ]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Swaziland]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth monarchies]]\n[[Category:Countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:English-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Kingdoms]]\n[[Category:Landlocked countries]]\n[[Category:Member states of the African Union]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Southern African countries]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1968]]\n", "name_user": "Mazbel", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:Mswati III King of Swaziland.JPG\u2192File:Mswati III King of Eswatini.jpgCriterion 3(obvious error) \u00b7 The new official name \"Eswatini\" has been officially recognized by the United Nations since August 2018 (UN M49 standard).

For example, it is now generally admitted that St. George cannot safely be identified by the nameless martyr spoken of by Eusebius (Church History VIII.5), who tore down Diocletian's edict of persecution at Nicomedia. The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis.

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on the 23rd of April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

In [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 calendar]] this rank was reduced to \"Simple\", and in [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960 calendar]] to a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|\"Commemoration\"]].

His [[calendar of saints|major feast day]] is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before [[Easter]], it is celebrated on [[Easter Monday]], instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of St. George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the [[consecration]] of a [[cathedral]] dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (305\u201337). When the church was consecrated, the [[relic]]s of the Saint George were transferred there. The other feast is on 26 November for a church dedicated to him in [[Kiev]], ''circa'' 1054.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], Saint George's day ({{lang-bg|\u0413\u0435\u0440\u0433\u044c\u043e\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d}}) is celebrated on 6 May, when it is customary to slaughter and roast a lamb. Saint George's day is also a [[public holiday]].\n\nIn [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] refers to Saint George as ''Sveti Djordje'' (''\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0402\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435'') or ''Sveti Georgije'' (''\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0458\u0435'').

The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on the 23rd of April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

The [[radio format|format]] focuses on [[contemporary hit radio]], specialising [[pop music]] and chart hits from the 1980s to the present. \u00d63 has the biggest [[Audience measurement|audience share]] by far (averaging 31%) of all Austrian radio stations.\n\n==History==\n\u00d63 was launched by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF broadcaster]] in 1967 when the new broadcasting law came into force in Austria. This was enforced by the Austrian population in 1964 with a referendum against the Proporzfunk. \n\nORF General Director Gerd Bacher brought Ernst Grissemann to Vienna and entrusted him with building the entertainment radio in the reformed [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. Frank Elstner acted as advisor. Hermann Egger, head of the entertainment department at the ORF regional studio in Tyrol, was originally \u00d63 boss; but he returned to his old position after a few weeks. The first broadcast of \u00d63 went on the ether on October 1, 1967. The team from the very beginning included Dieter Dorner, Walter Richard Langer (Vocal Instrumental International), Reinhard Mildner, Alfred Komarek (exclusive melody, texts with Ernst Grissemann), Andr\u00e9 Heller (''Die Musicbox''), Rudi Klausnitzer (''\u00d63 Wecker''). With Gerd Bacher's \"Schnulzenerlass\" in 1968, the quota of German-language music was reduced to \u00d63 in favor of music of Anglo-Saxon origin. \n\nIn 1977, \u00d63 started its 24-hour round-the-clock program. In 1984, due to technical developments, all 250,000 music tracks were digitally saved. \u00d63 formats, which were exclusively dedicated to Austrian pop music (''Austropop''), were the \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" from 1982 to 1985 and the ''Austroparade'' from 1985 to 1990. The \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" was founded in 1992 reintroduced. \n\nIn preparation for the liberalization of the broadcasting market in 1998, \u00d63 was converted into a pure format radio in 1996, the \"red-white-red radio\" was no longer authorized, and further cultural programs and alternative programs were largely handed over to [[\u00d61]] or [[FM4]] .The radio quota propagated by the public [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] radio stations in December 2009 based on self-regulation to play a 30 percent share of Austrian music has so far not been implemented by \u00d63 or the other stations (as of June 2016).\n\n\n'''\u00d63 Program Manager since 1967'''\n\n* 1967 Hermann Egger & Ernst Grissemann\n* 1979 Rudi Klausnitzer\n* 1987 Dieter Dorner\n* 1991 Edgar B\u00f6hm\n* 1994 Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107\n* since 2002 Georg Spatt\n\n== General ==\nHitradio \u00d63 is one of the three ORF radio programs broadcast nationwide and the radio with the largest reach in Austria.

The radio is assigned to the Hot AC radio format.\n\n== Broadcasting studio ==\nHitradio \u00d63 is based in the capital city of Vienna. In 1997, the editorial office and broadcast studio moved from the ORF broadcasting center on Argentinerstrasse in Vienna to two open-plan office floors in Heiligenstadt. These offer space for more than 100 employees. The spatial arrangement of the editorial workplaces is intended to achieve maximum cooperation at work. The center of the upper floor is the spacious digital broadcasting studio. It is one of the most modern in Europe.\n\n== Internet presence ==\nAn information platform is offered to the listener on the website of the radio station. Current news, information about the station, charts etc. can be called up here. You can also take a look at the broadcasting studio of the radio station via a web camera, listen to the current radio program via live stream, and use the \u00d63 hit service to track all music tracks that have been played over the past 30 days.

The [[radio format|format]] focuses on [[contemporary hit radio]], specialising [[pop music]] and chart hits from the 1980s to the present. \u00d63 has the biggest [[Audience measurement|audience share]] by far (averaging 31%) of all Austrian radio stations.\n\n==History==\n\u00d63 was launched by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF broadcaster]] in 1967 when the new broadcasting law came into force in Austria. This was enforced by the Austrian population in 1964 with a referendum against the Proporzfunk. \n\nORF General Director Gerd Bacher brought Ernst Grissemann to Vienna and entrusted him with building the entertainment radio in the reformed [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. Frank Elstner acted as advisor. Hermann Egger, head of the entertainment department at the ORF regional studio in Tyrol, was originally \u00d63 boss; but he returned to his old position after a few weeks. The first broadcast of \u00d63 went on the ether on October 1, 1967. The team from the very beginning included Dieter Dorner, Walter Richard Langer (Vocal Instrumental International), Reinhard Mildner, Alfred Komarek (exclusive melody, texts with Ernst Grissemann), Andr\u00e9 Heller (''Die Musicbox''), Rudi Klausnitzer (''\u00d63 Wecker''). With Gerd Bacher's \"Schnulzenerlass\" in 1968, the quota of German-language music was reduced to \u00d63 in favor of music of Anglo-Saxon origin. \n\nIn 1977, \u00d63 started its 24-hour round-the-clock program. In 1984, due to technical developments, all 250,000 music tracks were digitally saved. \u00d63 formats, which were exclusively dedicated to Austrian pop music (''Austropop''), were the \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" from 1982 to 1985 and the ''Austroparade'' from 1985 to 1990. The \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" was founded in 1992 reintroduced. \n\nIn preparation for the liberalization of the broadcasting market in 1998, \u00d63 was converted into a pure format radio in 1996, the \"red-white-red radio\" was no longer authorized, and further cultural programs and alternative programs were largely handed over to [[\u00d61]] or [[FM4]] .The radio quota propagated by the public [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] radio stations in December 2009 based on self-regulation to play a 30 percent share of Austrian music has so far not been implemented by \u00d63 or the other stations (as of June 2016).\n\n\n'''\u00d63 Program Manager since 1967'''\n\n* 1967 Hermann Egger & Ernst Grissemann\n* 1979 Rudi Klausnitzer\n* 1987 Dieter Dorner\n* 1991 Edgar B\u00f6hm\n* 1994 Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107\n* since 2002 Georg Spatt\n\n== General ==\nHitradio \u00d63 is one of the three ORF radio programs broadcast nationwide and the radio with the largest reach in Austria.

The center of the upper floor is the spacious digital broadcasting studio.

{"title_page": "Calculation of radiocarbon dates", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{lead too short|date=January 2016}}\n{{Underlinked|date=August 2014}}\n}}\n\n[[Radiocarbon]] dating methods produce data that must then be further manipulated in order to calculate a resulting \"radiocarbon age\".\n\n==[[Calculation|Calculations]]==\nThe calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used, since beta counters measure the sample's radioactivity, whereas [[accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometers]] (AMS) determine the ratio of the three different [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon isotopes]] in the sample.<ref>McNichol, Jull & Burr, \"Converting AMS Data to Radiocarbon Values: Considerations and Conventions\", pp. 313.</ref>\n\n===Standards===\nThe calculations to convert measured data to an estimate of the age of the sample require the use of several standards. One of these, the standard for normalizing {{delta|13|C}} values, is [[Peedee Formation|Pee Dee]] [[Belemnitella|Belemnite]] (PDB), a fossil which has a {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of 1.12372%.<ref>Dass (2007), p.276.</ref> A related standard is the use of wood, which has a {{delta|13|C}} of -25\u2030, as the material for which radiocarbon ages are calibrated. Since different materials have different {{delta|13|C}} values, it is possible for two samples of different materials, of the same age, to have different levels of radioactivity and different {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios. To compensate for this, the measurements are converted to the activity, or isotope ratio, that would have been measured if the sample had been made of wood. This is possible because the {{delta|13|C}} of wood is known, and the {{delta|13|C}} of the sample material can be measured, or taken from a table of typical values. The details of the calculations for beta counting and AMS are given below.<ref name=\":12\">Aitken, ''Science-based Dating in Archaeology'', p. 92\u201395.</ref>\n\nAnother standard is the use of 1950 as \"present\", in the sense that a calculation that shows that a sample's likely age is 500 years \"before present\" means that it is likely to have come from about the year 1450. This convention is necessary in order to keep published radiocarbon results comparable to each other; without this convention, a given radiocarbon result would be of no use unless the year it was measured was also known\u2014an age of 500 years published in 2010 would indicate a likely sample date of 1510, for example. In order to allow measurements to be converted to the 1950 baseline, a standard activity level is defined for the radioactivity of wood in 1950. Because of the fossil fuel effect, this is not actually the activity level of wood from 1950; the activity would have been somewhat lower.<ref name=\":18\" /> The fossil fuel effect was eliminated from the standard value by measuring wood from 1890, and using the radioactive decay equations to determine what the activity would have been at the year of growth. The resulting standard value, A<sub>abs</sub>, is 226 becquerels per kilogram of carbon.<ref name=\":13\">L'Annunziata, ''Radioactivity'', p. 528.</ref>\n\nBoth beta counting and AMS measure standard samples as part of their methodology. These samples contain carbon of a known activity.<ref name=\":9\">Aitken, ''Science-based Dating in Archaeology'', pp. 82-85.</ref> The first standard, Oxalic Acid SRM 4990B, also referred to as HOxI, was a 1,000&nbsp;lb batch of [[oxalic acid]] created in 1955 by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). Since it was created after the start of atomic testing, it incorporates bomb carbon, so measured activity is higher than the desired standard. This is addressed by defining the standard to be 0.95 times the activity of HOxI.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nAll of this first standard has long since been consumed, and later standards have been created, each of which has a given ratio to the desired standard activity. A secondary standard, Oxalic Acid SRM 4990C, also referred to as HOxII, 1,000&nbsp;lb of which was prepared by NIST in 1977 from French beet harvests, is now in wide use.<ref>J. Terasmae, \"Radiocarbon Dating: Some Problems and Potential Developments\", in Mahaney, ''Quaternary Dating Methods'', p. 5.</ref>\n\n===Calculations for beta counting devices===\nTo determine the age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to the activity of the standard must be found. The equation:<ref name=\":10\">Eriksson Stenstr\u00f6m et al., \"A guide to radiocarbon units and calculations\", p. 3.</ref>\n\n:<math>A_s = A_{std} \\left ( \\frac{M_s - M_b}{M_{std} - M_b} \\right ) </math>\n\ngives the required ratio, where A<sub>s</sub> is the true activity of the sample, A<sub>std</sub> is the true activity of the standard, M<sub>s</sub> is the measured activity of the sample, M<sub>std</sub> is the measured activity of the standard, and M<sub>b</sub> is the measured activity of the blank.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nA correction must also be made for fractionation. The fractionation correction converts the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio for the sample to the ratio it would have had if the material was wood, which has a {{delta|13|C}} value of -25\u2030. This is necessary because determining the age of the sample requires a comparison of the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the sample with what it would have had if it newly formed from the biosphere. The standard used for modern carbon is wood, with a baseline date of 1950.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nCorrecting for fractionation changes the activity measured in the sample to the activity it would have if it were wood of the same age as the sample. The calculation requires the definition of a {{chem|13|C}} fractionation factor, which is defined for any sample material as<ref name=\":18\">Eriksson Stenstrom et al. ''A Guide to Radiocarbon Units and Calculations'', p. 6.</ref>\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{Frac}_\\ce{13/12 (sample)} = \\frac {\\left(\\frac\\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C}\\right)_\\ce{wood}}{\\left(\\frac\\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C}\\right)_\\ce{sample}}</math>\n\nThe {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor, Frac<sub>14/12</sub>, is approximately the square of this, to an accuracy of 1\u2030:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math>\\text{Frac}_\\text{14/12 (sample)} = (\\text{Frac}_\\text{13/12 (sample)})^2</math>\n\nMultiplying the measured activity for the sample by the {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor converts it to the activity that it would have had had the sample been wood:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math>A_{sn} = A_s\\text{Frac}_{14/12(s)}</math>\n\nwhere A<sub>sn</sub> is the normalized activity for the sample, and Frac<sub>14/12 (s)</sub> is the {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor for the sample.<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\nThe equation for \u03b413C given earlier can be rearranged to<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math chem>\\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{sample} = \\left ( 1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C}{1000} \\right ) \\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{PDB}</math>\n\nSubstituting this in the {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor, and also substituting the value for \u03b413C for wood of -25\u2030, gives the following expression:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math chem>A_{sn} = A_s \\left ( \\frac {\\left (1 - \\frac {25}{1000} \\right )\\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{PDB}}{\\left (1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C}{1000} \\right )\\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{PDB}} \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere the \u03b413C value remaining in the equation is the value for the sample itself. This can be measured directly, or simply looked up in a table of characteristic values for the type of sample material&mdash;this latter approach leads to increased uncertainty in the result, as there is a range of possible \u03b413C values for each possible sample material. Cancelling the PDB {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio reduces this to:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math chem>A_{sn} = A_s \\left ( \\frac {\\left (1 - \\frac {25}{1000} \\right )}{\\left (1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C}{1000} \\right )} \\right )^2</math>\n\n===AMS calculations===\nThe results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of {{chem|12|C}}, {{chem|13|C}}, and {{chem|14|C}}. These ratios are used to calculate {{mvar|F<sub>m</sub>}}, the \"fraction modern\", defined as\n\n:<math>F_m = \\frac{R_{norm}}{R_{modern}}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|R<sub>norm</sub>}} is the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio for the sample, after correcting for fractionation, and {{mvar|R<sub>modern</sub>}} is the standard {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio for modern carbon.<ref name=\":11\">McNichol, Jull & Burr, \"Converting AMS Data to Radiocarbon Values: Considerations and Conventions\", pp. 315-318.</ref>\n\nThe calculation begins by subtracting the ratio measured for the machine blank from the other sample measurements. That is:\n\n:<math>R'_s = R_s - R_{mb}</math>\n\n:<math>R'_{std} = R_{std} - R_{mb}</math>\n\n:<math>R'_{pb} = R_{pb} - R_{mb}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|R<sub>s</sub>}} is the measured sample {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio; {{mvar|R<sub>std</sub>}} is the measured ratio for the standard; {{mvar|R<sub>pb</sub>}} is the measured ratio for the process blank, and {{mvar|R<sub>mb</sub>}} is the measured ratio for the machine blank. The next step, to correct for fractionation, can be done using either the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio or the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio, and also depends on which of the two possible standards was measured: HOxI or HoxII. {{mvar|R'<sub>std</sub>}} is then {{mvar|R'}}<sub>HOxI</sub> or {{mvar|R'}}<sub>HOxII</sub>, depending on which standard was used. The four possible equations are as follows. First, if the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is used to perform the fractionation correction, the following two equations apply, one for each standard.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxI,-19} = R'_\\ce{HoxI}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-19} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXI}} {1000}}\\right )^2</math>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxII,-25} = R'_\\ce{HoxII}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXII}} {1000}} \\right )^2</math>\n\nIf the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio is used instead, then the equations for each standard are:<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxI,-19} = R'_\\ce{HoxI}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-19} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXI}} {1000}} \\right )</math>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxII,-25} = R'_\\ce{HoxII}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXII}} {1000}} \\right )</math>\n\nThe \u03b413C values in the equations measure the fractionation in the standards as {{chem|CO|2}}, prior to their conversion to graphite to use as a target in the spectrometer. This assumes that the conversion to graphite does not introduce significant additional fractionation.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nOnce the appropriate value above has been calculated, {{mvar|R<sub>modern</sub>}} can be determined; it is<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math>R_{modern} = 0.95R_\\text{HOxI,-19} = .7459R_\\text{HOxII,-25}</math>\n\nThe values 0.95 and 0.7459 are part of the definition of the two standards; they convert the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the standards to the ratio that modern carbon would have had in 1950 if there had been no fossil fuel effect.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nSince it is common practice to measure the standards repeatedly during an AMS run, alternating the standard target with the sample being measured, there are multiple measurements available for the standard, and these measurements provide a couple of options in the calculation of {{mvar|R<sub>modern</sub>}}. Different labs use this data in different ways; some simply average the values, while others consider the measurements made on the standard target as a series, and interpolate the readings that would have been measured during the sample run, if the standard had been measured at that time instead.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nNext, the uncorrected fraction modern is calculated; \"uncorrected\" means that this intermediate value does not include the fractionation correction.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math>Fm_{uc} = \\frac {R'_s} {R_{modern}}</math>\n\nNow the measured fraction modern can be determined, by correcting for fractionation. As above there are two equations, depending on whether the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} or {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio is being used. If the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is being used:<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>Fm_{ms} = Fm_{uc}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac {\\ce{\\delta^{13}C}_s} {1000}} \\right )^2</math>\n\nIf the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio is being used:<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>Fm_{ms} = Fm_{uc}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac {\\ce{\\delta^{13}C}_s} {1000}} \\right )</math>\n\nThe \u03b413C<sub>s</sub> value is from the sample itself, measured on {{chem|CO|2}} prepared while converting the sample to graphite.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nThe final step is to adjust {{mvar|Fm<sub>ms</sub>}} for the measured fraction modern of the process blank, {{mvar|Fm<sub>pb</sub>}}, which is calculated as above for the sample. One approach{{#tag:ref|McNichol & Burr give two other calculations, one of which can be shown to be equivalent to the one given here. The other depends on the process blank being the same mass as the sample.<ref name=\":11\"/>|group=note}} is to determine the mass of the measured carbon, {{mvar|C<sub>ms</sub>}}, along with {{mvar|C<sub>pb</sub>}}, the mass of the process blank, and C<sub>s</sub>, the mass of the sample. The final fraction modern, {{mvar|Fm<sub>s</sub>}} is then<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>Fm_s = \\frac {Fm_{ms}\\ce{C}_{ms} - Fm_{pb}\\ce{C}_{pb}} {\\ce{C}_s}</math>\n\nThe fraction modern is then converted to an age in \"radiocarbon years\", meaning that the calculation uses Libby's [[half-life]] of 5,568 years, not the more accurate modern value of 5,730 years, and that no calibration has been done:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/nosams/page.do?pid=40146 |title=Radiocarbon Data Calculations: NOSAMS|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|year=2007|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\text{Age} = -8033 \\ln (Fm)</math>\n\n===Errors and reliability===\nThere are several possible sources of error in both the beta counting and AMS methods, although laboratories vary in how they report errors. All laboratories report counting statistics\u2014that is, statistics showing possible errors in counting the decay events or number of atoms\u2014with an error term of 1\u03c3 (i.e. 68% confidence that the true value is within the given range).<ref name=Taylor_102-104 /> These errors can be reduced by extending the counting duration: for example, testing a modern benzene sample will find about eight decay events per minute per gram of benzene, and 250 minutes of counting will suffice to give an error of \u00b1 80 years, with 68% confidence. If the benzene sample contains carbon that is about 5,730 years old (the half-life of {{chem|14|C}}), then there will only be half as many decay events per minute, but the same error term of 80 years could be obtained by doubling the counting time to 500 minutes.<ref name=\"Bowman_38-39\">Bowman, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', pp.&nbsp;38&ndash;39.</ref><ref name=Taylor_124>Taylor, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', p.&nbsp;124.</ref> Note that the error term is not symmetric, though the effect is negligible for recent samples; for a sample with an estimated age of 30,600 years, the error term might be +1600 to -1300.<ref name=Taylor_102-104>Taylor, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', p. 102\u2212104.</ref>\n\nTo be completely accurate, the error term quoted for the reported radiocarbon age should incorporate counting errors not only from the sample, but also from counting decay events for the reference sample, and for blanks. It should also incorporate errors on every measurement taken as part of the dating method, including, for example, the \u03b413C term for the sample, or any laboratory conditions being corrected for such as temperature or voltage. These errors should then be [[Propagation of uncertainty|mathematically combined]] to give an overall term for the error in the reported age, but in practice laboratories differ, not only in the terms they choose to include in their error calculations, but also in the way they combine errors. The resulting 1\u03c3 estimates have been shown to typically underestimate the true error, and it has even been suggested that doubling the given 1\u03c3 error term results in a more accurate value.<ref name=Taylor_102-104 /><ref name=\"Bowman_38-39\" />\n\nThe usual presentation of a radiocarbon date, as a specific date plus or minus an error term, obscures the fact that the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. In 1970, the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory ran weekly measurements on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1\u03c3 confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The extreme measurements included one with a maximum age of under 4,400 years, and another with a minimum age of over 4,500 years.<ref>Taylor, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', pp. 125\u2212126.</ref>\n\nIt is also possible for laboratories to have systematic errors, caused by weaknesses in their methodologies. For example, if 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample is allowed to evaporate, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years. Laboratories work to detect these errors both by testing their own procedures, and by periodic inter-laboratory comparisons of a variety of different samples; any laboratories whose results differ from the consensus radiocarbon age by too great an amount may be suffering from systematic errors. Even if the systematic errors are not corrected, the laboratory can estimate the magnitude of the effect and include this in the published error estimates for their results.<ref>Bowman, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', pp. 40\u221241.</ref>\n\nThe limit of measurability is approximately eight half-lives, or about 45,000 years. Samples older than this will typically be reported as having an infinite age. Some techniques have been developed to extend the range of dating further into the past, including isotopic enrichment, or large samples and very high precision counters. These methods have in some cases increased the maximum age that can be reported for a sample to 60,000 and even 75,000 years.<ref name=\":14\">Mike Walker, Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Wales, Lampeter, UK ''Quaternary Dating Methods'', John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 2005, page 23.

One of these, the standard for normalizing {{delta|13|C}} values, is [[Peedee Formation|Pee Dee]] [[Belemnitella|Belemnite]] (PDB), a fossil which has a {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of 1.12372%.<ref>Dass (2007), p.276.</ref> A related standard is the use of wood, which has a {{delta|13|C}} of -25\u2030, as the material for which radiocarbon ages are calibrated. Since different materials have different {{delta|13|C}} values, it is possible for two samples of different materials, of the same age, to have different levels of radioactivity and different {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios. To compensate for this, the measurements are converted to the activity, or isotope ratio, that would have been measured if the sample had been made of wood. This is possible because the {{delta|13|C}} of wood is known, and the {{delta|13|C}} of the sample material can be measured, or taken from a table of typical values. The details of the calculations for beta counting and AMS are given below.<ref name=\":12\">Aitken, ''Science-based Dating in Archaeology'', p. 92\u201395.</ref>\n\nAnother standard is the use of 1950 as \"present\", in the sense that a calculation that shows that a sample's likely age is 500 years \"before present\" means that it is likely to have come from about the year 1450. This convention is necessary in order to keep published radiocarbon results comparable to each other; without this convention, a given radiocarbon result would be of no use unless the year it was measured was also known\u2014an age of 500 years published in 2010 would indicate a likely sample date of 1510, for example. In order to allow measurements to be converted to the 1950 baseline, a standard activity level is defined for the radioactivity of wood in 1950. Because of the fossil fuel effect, this is not actually the activity level of wood from 1950; the activity would have been somewhat lower.<ref name=\":18\" /> The fossil fuel effect was eliminated from the standard value by measuring wood from 1890, and using the radioactive decay equations to determine what the activity would have been at the year of growth. The resulting standard value, A<sub>abs</sub>, is 226 becquerels per kilogram of carbon.<ref name=\":13\">L'Annunziata, ''Radioactivity'', p. 528.</ref>\n\nBoth beta counting and AMS measure standard samples as part of their methodology. These samples contain carbon of a known activity.<ref name=\":9\">Aitken, ''Science-based Dating in Archaeology'', pp. 82-85.</ref> The first standard, Oxalic Acid SRM 4990B, also referred to as HOxI, was a 1,000&nbsp;lb batch of [[oxalic acid]] created in 1955 by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). Since it was created after the start of atomic testing, it incorporates bomb carbon, so measured activity is higher than the desired standard. This is addressed by defining the standard to be 0.95 times the activity of HOxI.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nAll of this first standard has long since been consumed, and later standards have been created, each of which has a given ratio to the desired standard activity. A secondary standard, Oxalic Acid SRM 4990C, also referred to as HOxII, 1,000&nbsp;lb of which was prepared by NIST in 1977 from French beet harvests, is now in wide use.<ref>J. Terasmae, \"Radiocarbon Dating: Some Problems and Potential Developments\", in Mahaney, ''Quaternary Dating Methods'', p. 5.</ref>\n\n===Calculations for beta counting devices===\nTo determine the age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to the activity of the standard must be found. The equation:<ref name=\":10\">Eriksson Stenstr\u00f6m et al., \"A guide to radiocarbon units and calculations\", p. 3.</ref>\n\n:<math>A_s = A_{std} \\left ( \\frac{M_s - M_b}{M_{std} - M_b} \\right ) </math>\n\ngives the required ratio, where A<sub>s</sub> is the true activity of the sample, A<sub>std</sub> is the true activity of the standard, M<sub>s</sub> is the measured activity of the sample, M<sub>std</sub> is the measured activity of the standard, and M<sub>b</sub> is the measured activity of the blank.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nA correction must also be made for fractionation. The fractionation correction converts the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio for the sample to the ratio it would have had if the material was wood, which has a {{delta|13|C}} value of -25\u2030. This is necessary because determining the age of the sample requires a comparison of the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the sample with what it would have had if it newly formed from the biosphere. The standard used for modern carbon is wood, with a baseline date of 1950.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nCorrecting for fractionation changes the activity measured in the sample to the activity it would have if it were wood of the same age as the sample. The calculation requires the definition of a {{chem|13|C}} fractionation factor, which is defined for any sample material as<ref name=\":18\">Eriksson Stenstrom et al. ''A Guide to Radiocarbon Units and Calculations'', p. 6.</ref>\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{Frac}_\\ce{13/12 (sample)} = \\frac {\\left(\\frac\\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C}\\right)_\\ce{wood}}{\\left(\\frac\\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C}\\right)_\\ce{sample}}</math>\n\nThe {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor, Frac<sub>14/12</sub>, is approximately the square of this, to an accuracy of 1\u2030:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math>\\text{Frac}_\\text{14/12 (sample)} = (\\text{Frac}_\\text{13/12 (sample)})^2</math>\n\nMultiplying the measured activity for the sample by the {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor converts it to the activity that it would have had had the sample been wood:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math>A_{sn} = A_s\\text{Frac}_{14/12(s)}</math>\n\nwhere A<sub>sn</sub> is the normalized activity for the sample, and Frac<sub>14/12 (s)</sub> is the {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor for the sample.<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\nThe equation for \u03b413C given earlier can be rearranged to<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math chem>\\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{sample} = \\left ( 1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C}{1000} \\right ) \\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{PDB}</math>\n\nSubstituting this in the {{chem|14|C}} fractionation factor, and also substituting the value for \u03b413C for wood of -25\u2030, gives the following expression:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math chem>A_{sn} = A_s \\left ( \\frac {\\left (1 - \\frac {25}{1000} \\right )\\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{PDB}}{\\left (1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C}{1000} \\right )\\left ( \\frac \\ce{^{13}C}\\ce{^{12}C} \\right )_\\ce{PDB}} \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere the \u03b413C value remaining in the equation is the value for the sample itself. This can be measured directly, or simply looked up in a table of characteristic values for the type of sample material&mdash;this latter approach leads to increased uncertainty in the result, as there is a range of possible \u03b413C values for each possible sample material. Cancelling the PDB {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio reduces this to:<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n:<math chem>A_{sn} = A_s \\left ( \\frac {\\left (1 - \\frac {25}{1000} \\right )}{\\left (1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C}{1000} \\right )} \\right )^2</math>\n\n===AMS calculations===\nThe results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of {{chem|12|C}}, {{chem|13|C}}, and {{chem|14|C}}. These ratios are used to calculate {{mvar|F<sub>m</sub>}}, the \"fraction modern\", defined as\n\n:<math>F_m = \\frac{R_{norm}}{R_{modern}}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|R<sub>norm</sub>}} is the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio for the sample, after correcting for fractionation, and {{mvar|R<sub>modern</sub>}} is the standard {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio for modern carbon.<ref name=\":11\">McNichol, Jull & Burr, \"Converting AMS Data to Radiocarbon Values: Considerations and Conventions\", pp. 315-318.</ref>\n\nThe calculation begins by subtracting the ratio measured for the machine blank from the other sample measurements. That is:\n\n:<math>R'_s = R_s - R_{mb}</math>\n\n:<math>R'_{std} = R_{std} - R_{mb}</math>\n\n:<math>R'_{pb} = R_{pb} - R_{mb}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|R<sub>s</sub>}} is the measured sample {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio; {{mvar|R<sub>std</sub>}} is the measured ratio for the standard; {{mvar|R<sub>pb</sub>}} is the measured ratio for the process blank, and {{mvar|R<sub>mb</sub>}} is the measured ratio for the machine blank. The next step, to correct for fractionation, can be done using either the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio or the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio, and also depends on which of the two possible standards was measured: HOxI or HoxII. {{mvar|R'<sub>std</sub>}} is then {{mvar|R'}}<sub>HOxI</sub> or {{mvar|R'}}<sub>HOxII</sub>, depending on which standard was used. The four possible equations are as follows. First, if the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is used to perform the fractionation correction, the following two equations apply, one for each standard.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxI,-19} = R'_\\ce{HoxI}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-19} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXI}} {1000}}\\right )^2</math>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxII,-25} = R'_\\ce{HoxII}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXII}} {1000}} \\right )^2</math>\n\nIf the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio is used instead, then the equations for each standard are:<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxI,-19} = R'_\\ce{HoxI}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-19} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXI}} {1000}} \\right )</math>\n\n:<math chem>R_\\ce{HOxII,-25} = R'_\\ce{HoxII}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac \\ce{\\delta^{13}C_{HoXII}} {1000}} \\right )</math>\n\nThe \u03b413C values in the equations measure the fractionation in the standards as {{chem|CO|2}}, prior to their conversion to graphite to use as a target in the spectrometer. This assumes that the conversion to graphite does not introduce significant additional fractionation.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nOnce the appropriate value above has been calculated, {{mvar|R<sub>modern</sub>}} can be determined; it is<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math>R_{modern} = 0.95R_\\text{HOxI,-19} = .7459R_\\text{HOxII,-25}</math>\n\nThe values 0.95 and 0.7459 are part of the definition of the two standards; they convert the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the standards to the ratio that modern carbon would have had in 1950 if there had been no fossil fuel effect.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nSince it is common practice to measure the standards repeatedly during an AMS run, alternating the standard target with the sample being measured, there are multiple measurements available for the standard, and these measurements provide a couple of options in the calculation of {{mvar|R<sub>modern</sub>}}. Different labs use this data in different ways; some simply average the values, while others consider the measurements made on the standard target as a series, and interpolate the readings that would have been measured during the sample run, if the standard had been measured at that time instead.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nNext, the uncorrected fraction modern is calculated; \"uncorrected\" means that this intermediate value does not include the fractionation correction.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math>Fm_{uc} = \\frac {R'_s} {R_{modern}}</math>\n\nNow the measured fraction modern can be determined, by correcting for fractionation. As above there are two equations, depending on whether the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} or {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio is being used. If the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is being used:<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>Fm_{ms} = Fm_{uc}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac {\\ce{\\delta^{13}C}_s} {1000}} \\right )^2</math>\n\nIf the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|13|C}} ratio is being used:<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>Fm_{ms} = Fm_{uc}\\left ( \\frac {1 + \\frac {-25} {1000}} {1 + \\frac {\\ce{\\delta^{13}C}_s} {1000}} \\right )</math>\n\nThe \u03b413C<sub>s</sub> value is from the sample itself, measured on {{chem|CO|2}} prepared while converting the sample to graphite.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nThe final step is to adjust {{mvar|Fm<sub>ms</sub>}} for the measured fraction modern of the process blank, {{mvar|Fm<sub>pb</sub>}}, which is calculated as above for the sample. One approach{{#tag:ref|McNichol & Burr give two other calculations, one of which can be shown to be equivalent to the one given here. The other depends on the process blank being the same mass as the sample.<ref name=\":11\"/>|group=note}} is to determine the mass of the measured carbon, {{mvar|C<sub>ms</sub>}}, along with {{mvar|C<sub>pb</sub>}}, the mass of the process blank, and C<sub>s</sub>, the mass of the sample. The final fraction modern, {{mvar|Fm<sub>s</sub>}} is then<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n:<math chem>Fm_s = \\frac {Fm_{ms}\\ce{C}_{ms} - Fm_{pb}\\ce{C}_{pb}} {\\ce{C}_s}</math>\n\nThe fraction modern is then converted to an age in \"radiocarbon years\", meaning that the calculation uses Libby's [[half-life]] of 5,568 years, not the more accurate modern value of 5,730 years, and that no calibration has been done:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/nosams/page.do?pid=40146 |title=Radiocarbon Data Calculations: NOSAMS|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|year=2007|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\text{Age} = -8033 \\ln (Fm)</math>\n\n===Errors and reliability===\nThere are several possible sources of error in both the beta counting and AMS methods, although laboratories vary in how they report errors. All laboratories report counting statistics\u2014that is, statistics showing possible errors in counting the decay events or number of atoms\u2014with an error term of 1\u03c3 (i.e. 68% confidence that the true value is within the given range).<ref name=Taylor_102-104 /> These errors can be reduced by extending the counting duration: for example, testing a modern benzene sample will find about eight decay events per minute per gram of benzene, and 250 minutes of counting will suffice to give an error of \u00b1 80 years, with 68% confidence. If the benzene sample contains carbon that is about 5,730 years old (the half-life of {{chem|14|C}}), then there will only be half as many decay events per minute, but the same error term of 80 years could be obtained by doubling the counting time to 500 minutes.<ref name=\"Bowman_38-39\">Bowman, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', pp.&nbsp;38&ndash;39.</ref><ref name=Taylor_124>Taylor, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', p.&nbsp;124.</ref> Note that the error term is not symmetric, though the effect is negligible for recent samples; for a sample with an estimated age of 30,600 years, the error term might be +1600 to -1300.<ref name=Taylor_102-104>Taylor, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', p. 102\u2212104.</ref>\n\nTo be completely accurate, the error term quoted for the reported radiocarbon age should incorporate counting errors not only from the sample, but also from counting decay events for the reference sample, and for blanks. It should also incorporate errors on every measurement taken as part of the dating method, including, for example, the \u03b413C term for the sample, or any laboratory conditions being corrected for such as temperature or voltage. These errors should then be [[Propagation of uncertainty|mathematically combined]] to give an overall term for the error in the reported age, but in practice laboratories differ, not only in the terms they choose to include in their error calculations, but also in the way they combine errors. The resulting 1\u03c3 estimates have been shown to typically underestimate the true error, and it has even been suggested that doubling the given 1\u03c3 error term results in a more accurate value.<ref name=Taylor_102-104 /><ref name=\"Bowman_38-39\" />\n\nThe usual presentation of a radiocarbon date, as a specific date plus or minus an error term, obscures the fact that the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. In 1970, the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory ran weekly measurements on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1\u03c3 confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The extreme measurements included one with a maximum age of under 4,400 years, and another with a minimum age of over 4,500 years.<ref>Taylor, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', pp. 125\u2212126.</ref>\n\nIt is also possible for laboratories to have systematic errors, caused by weaknesses in their methodologies. For example, if 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample is allowed to evaporate, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years. Laboratories work to detect these errors both by testing their own procedures, and by periodic inter-laboratory comparisons of a variety of different samples; any laboratories whose results differ from the consensus radiocarbon age by too great an amount may be suffering from systematic errors. Even if the systematic errors are not corrected, the laboratory can estimate the magnitude of the effect and include this in the published error estimates for their results.<ref>Bowman, ''Radiocarbon Dating'', pp. 40\u221241.</ref>\n\nThe limit of measurability is approximately eight half-lives, or about 45,000 years. Samples older than this will typically be reported as having an infinite age. Some techniques have been developed to extend the range of dating further into the past, including isotopic enrichment, or large samples and very high precision counters. These methods have in some cases increased the maximum age that can be reported for a sample to 60,000 and even 75,000 years.<ref name=\":14\">Mike Walker, Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Wales, Lampeter, UK ''Quaternary Dating Methods'', John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 2005, page 23.
