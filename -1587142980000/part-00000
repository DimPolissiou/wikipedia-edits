I dont that she has done so yet, it is distressing.\"{{sic}}]]\n\nThe '''Donner Party''' (sometimes called the '''Donner\u2013Reed Party''') was a group of [[American pioneer]]s who migrated to [[California]] in a [[wagon train]] from the [[Midwest]]. Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846\u201347 snowbound in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. Some of the migrants resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive, eating the bodies of those who had succumbed to starvation and sickness.\n\nThe Donner Party departed [[Missouri]] on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the spring of 1846, behind many other pioneer families who were attempting to make the same overland trip. The journey west usually took between four and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed after electing to follow a new route called the [[Hastings Cutoff]], which bypassed established trails and instead crossed [[Utah]]'s [[Wasatch Mountains]] and the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]]. The desolate and rugged terrain, and the difficulties they later encountered while traveling along the [[Humboldt River]] in present-day [[Nevada]], resulted in the loss of many cattle and wagons, and divisions soon formed within the group.\n\nBy early Novreached the Sierra Nevada but became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]) high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran dangerously low, and in mid-December some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the migrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived the ordeal. Historians have described the episode as one of the most spectacular tragedies in California history, and in the entire record of American westward migration.<ref>McGlashan, p. 16; Stewart, p. 271.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Humboldt River Papa 2.jpg|thumb|An encampment of tents and covered wagons on the [[Humboldt River]] in Nevada, 1859]]<!-- needs [[WP:ALT]] -->\nDuring the 1840s, the United States saw a dramatic increase in settlers who left their homes in the east to resettle in the [[Oregon Territory]] or California, which at the time were only accessible by a very long sea voyage or a daunting overland journey across the American frontier.

To encourage settlers, he published ''The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California''.<ref name=rarick47/> As an alternative to the Oregon Trail's standard route through [[Idaho]]'s [[Snake River Plain]], he proposed a more direct route (which actually increased the trip's mileage) to California across the [[Great Basin]], which would take travelers through the [[Wasatch Range]] and across the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]].<ref name=rarick69/> Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to [[Fort Bridger]]. The fort was a scant supply station run by [[Jim Bridger]] and his partner [[Louis Vasquez]] in [[Blacks Fork]], Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route.<ref name=rarick47>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed the southern part of the Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.<ref name=rarick69/><ref group=upper-alpha>There are no written records of native tribes having crossed the desert, nor did the migrants mention any existing trails in this region.

The Breen family consisted of Patrick Breen (51), a farmer from Iowa, his wife Margaret (\"Peggy\", 40), and seven children: John (14), Edward (13), Patrick, Jr. (9), Simon (8), James (5), Peter (3), and 11-month-old Isabelle.

On July 12, the Reeds and Donners were given one of them.<ref>Johnson, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Hastings warned the migrants they could expect opposition from the Mexican authorities in California and advised them to band together in large groups. He also claimed to have \"worked out a new and better road to California\", and said he would be waiting at Fort Bridger to guide the migrants along the new cutoff.<ref name=Andrews1973>Andrews, Thomas F.

A smaller group opted to head for Fort Bridger and needed a leader. Most of the younger men in the group were European immigrants and not considered to be ideal leaders. James Reed had lived in the U.S. for a considerable time, was older, and had military experience, but his autocratic attitude had rubbed many in the party the wrong way, and they saw him as aristocratic, imperious, and ostentatious.<ref>Stewart, pp. 16\u201318.</ref> By comparison, the mature, experienced, American-born Donner's peaceful and charitable nature made him the group's first choice.<ref>Stewart, p. 14.</ref> The members of the party were comfortably well-off by contemporaneous standards.<ref name=rarick17/> Although they are called pioneers, most of the party lacked skills and experience for traveling through mountains and arid land. Additionally, the party had little knowledge about how to interact with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>Stewart, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Edwin Bryant (alcalde)|Edwin Bryant]] reached Blacks Fork a week ahead of the Donner Party. He saw the first part of the trail and was concerned that it would be difficult for the wagons in the Donner group, especially with so many women and children. He returned to Blacks Fork to leave letters warning several members of the group not to take Hastings' shortcut.<ref>Rarick, p. 56.</ref> By the time the Donner Party reached Blacks Fork on July 27, Hastings had already left, leading the forty wagons of the Harlan-Young group.<ref name=Andrews1973/> Because Jim Bridger's trading post would fare substantially better if people used the Hastings Cutoff, he told the party that the shortcut was a smooth trip, devoid of rugged country and hostile Native Americans, and would therefore shorten their journey by {{convert|350|mi|km}}. Water would be easy to find along the way, although a couple of days crossing a {{convert|30|\u2013|40|mi|km|adj=on}} dry lake bed would be necessary.\n\nReed was very impressed with this information and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.<ref name=Andrews1973/><ref>Stewart, pp. 25\u201327; Rarick, p. 58.</ref> At Fort Laramie, Reed met an old friend named James Clyman who was coming from California. Clyman warned Reed not to take the Hastings Cutoff, telling him that wagons would not be able to make it and that Hastings' information was inaccurate.<ref>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> Fellow pioneer [[Jesse Quinn Thornton]] traveled part of the way with Donner and Reed, and in his book ''From Oregon and California in 1848'' declared Hastings the \"[[Baron Munchausen]] of travelers in these countries\".<ref>Johnson, p. 20</ref> Tamsen Donner, according to Thornton, was \"gloomy, sad, and dispirited\" at the thought of turning off the main trail on the advice of Hastings, whom she considered \"a selfish adventurer\".<ref>Johnson, p. 22.</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 1846, the party left Blacks Fork after four days of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan-Young group. Donner hired a replacement driver, and the company was joined by the McCutcheon family, consisting of 30-year-old William, his 24-year-old wife Amanda, two-year-old daughter Harriet, and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, who claimed to have knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain on the way to California.<ref>Stewart, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Wasatch Mountains===\n[[File:Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah.JPG|thumb|Big Cottonwood Canyon, located several miles south of the Donner route in the heart of the Wasatch mountains of Northern Utah]]\n\nThe party turned south to follow the Hastings Cutoff. Within days, they found the terrain to be much more difficult than described. Drivers were forced to lock the wheels of their wagons to prevent them from rolling down steep inclines. Several years of traffic on the main Oregon Trail had left an easy and obvious path, whereas the Cutoff was more difficult to find. Hastings wrote directions and left letters stuck to trees. On August 6, the party found a letter from him advising them to stop until he could show them an alternate route to that taken by the Harlan-Young Party.<ref group=upper-alpha>While Hastings was otherwise occupied, his guides had led the Harlan-Young Party through [[Weber Canyon]], which was not the route that Hastings had intended to take. (Rarick, p. 61)</ref> Reed, Charles T. Stanton, and William Pike rode ahead to get Hastings. They encountered exceedingly difficult canyons where boulders had to be moved and walls cut off precariously to a river below, a route likely to break wagons. In his letter Hastings had offered to guide the Donner Party around the more difficult areas, but he rode back only part way, indicating the general direction to follow.<ref>Stewart, pp. 31\u201335.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nStanton and Pike stopped to rest, and Reed returned alone to the group, arriving four days after the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of [[Weber Canyon]], or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route.<ref>Rarick, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Their progress slowed to about one and a half miles (2.4 km) a day. All able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.<ref group=upper-alpha>The route that the party followed is now known as [[Emigration Canyon, Utah|Emigration Canyon]]. (Johnson, p. 28)</ref>\n\nAs the Donner Party made its way across the [[Wasatch Mountains]], the Graves family, who had set off to find them, reached them. They consisted of 57-year-old Franklin Ward Graves, his 47-year-old wife Elizabeth, their children Mary (20), William (18), Eleanor (15), Lovina (13), Nancy (9), Jonathan (7), Franklin, Jr. (5), Elizabeth (1), and married daughter Sarah (22), plus son-in-law Jay Fosdick (23), and a 25-year-old teamster named John Snyder, traveling together in three wagons. Their arrival brought the Donner Party to 87 members in 60\u201380 wagons.<ref>Rarick, pp. 67\u201368, Johnson, p. 25.</ref> The Graves family had been part of the last group to leave Missouri, confirming the Donner Party was at the back of the year's western exodus.<ref name=rarick68>Rarick, p. 68.</ref>\n\nIt was August 20 by the time that they reached a point in the mountains where they could look down and see the [[Great Salt Lake]]. It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Mountains. The men began arguing, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular James Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families. Stanton and Pike had ridden out with Reed but had become lost on their way back; by the time that the party found them, they were a day away from eating their horses.<ref>Stewart, pp. 36\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Great Salt Lake Desert===\n[[File:Butte in Great Salt Lake Desert-750px.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Flat expanse with a mountain range in the distance|[[Great Salt Lake Desert]]]]\n\nLuke Halloran died of [[tuberculosis]] on August 25. A few days later, the party came across a torn and tattered letter from Hastings. The pieces indicated there were two days and nights of difficult travel ahead without grass or water. The party rested their oxen and prepared for the trip.<ref name=rarick70and71>Rarick, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> After 36&nbsp;hours they set off to traverse a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain that lay in their path. From its peak, they saw ahead of them a dry, barren plain, perfectly flat and covered with white salt, larger than the one they had just crossed,<ref name=stewart40to44/> and \"one of the most inhospitable places on earth\" according to Rarick.<ref name=rarick69>Rarick, p. 69.</ref> Their oxen were already fatigued, and their water was nearly gone.<ref name=stewart40to44>Stewart, pp. 40\u201344.</ref>\n\nThe party pressed onward on August 30, having no alternative. In the heat of the day, the moisture underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned it into a gummy mass. The wagon wheels sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains and believed they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The rigors of the journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost. Instead of the promised two-day journey over {{convert|40|mi}}, the journey across the {{convert|80|mi}} of [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] had taken six.<ref>Stewart, pp. 44\u201350.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>In 1986, a team of archaeologists attempted to cross the same stretch of desert at the same time of year in four-wheel drive trucks and were unable to do so.

(Rarick, p. 74, Reed's own account \"The Snow-Bound, Starved Emigrants of 1846 Statement by Mr. Reed, One of the Donner Company\" in Johnson, p. 190)</ref> Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to [[Sutter's Fort]] in California; he had heard that [[John Sutter]] was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip.<ref>Rarick, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another {{convert|40|mi}} of [[Lahontan Valley|desert]] lay ahead.<ref name=stewart50to53>Stewart, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nTheir cattle and oxen were now exhausted and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed. The journey seemed to get easier, particularly through the valley next to the [[Ruby Mountains]]. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, they had no choice but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the [[Humboldt River]]. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\">Stewart, pp. 54\u201358.</ref><ref name=rarick80and81>Rarick, pp. 78\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Rejoining the trail==\n\n===Reed banished===\n\nAlong the Humboldt, the group met [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Native Americans, who joined them for a couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner families split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\"/><ref name=rarick80and81 />\n\nThat evening, the witnesses gathered to discuss what was to be done.

The company pressed on to cross the Sierra Nevada before the snows came.

Both the pass and the lake are now called Donner.]]\n\nFaced with one last push over mountains that were described as much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had to decide whether to forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently,<ref>Johnson, p. 43.</ref> an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then the Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graves, and the Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of their wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood but it seemed a superficial wound.<ref>Stewart, pp. 81\u201383.</ref>\n\nSnow began to fall. The Breens made it up the \"massive, nearly vertical slope\" {{convert|1000|ft|m}} to Truckee Lake (now known as [[Donner Lake]]), {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the summit, and camped near a cabin that had been built two years earlier by another group of pioneers.<ref>Rarick, p. 108.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>The cabins were built by three members of another group of migrants known as the Stevens Party, specifically by Joseph Foster, Allen Stevens, and Moses Schallenberger in November 1844.

Over the next few days, several more attempts were made to breach the pass with their wagons and animals, but all efforts failed.{{-}}\n\n===Winter camp===\n[[File:Map of Truckee Lake and Alder Creek.svg|thumb|right|350 px|Map showing the Truckee Lake and Alder Creek sites]]\n\nSixty members and associates of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families set up for the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and the Murphys another, and the Reeds and the Graves the third. Keseberg built a [[lean-to]] for his family against the side of the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, six of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: six men, three women, and twelve children in all.<ref>Stewart, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref><ref>Hardesty, p. 60.</ref> It began to snow again on the evening of November 4\u2014the beginning of a storm that lasted eight days.<ref>Stewart, pp. 84\u201387.</ref>\n\nBy the time the party made camp, very little food remained from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter's Fort. The oxen began to die, and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had little luck after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything. Margret Reed promised to pay double when they got to California for the use of three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25\u2014normally the cost of two healthy oxen\u2014for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.<ref>Stewart, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 44.</ref>\n\nDesperation grew in camp and some reasoned that individuals might succeed in navigating the pass where the wagons could not. On November 12, the storm abated, and a small party tried to reach the summit on foot but found the trek through the soft, deep powder too difficult, and returned that same evening. Over the next week, two more attempts were made by other small parties, but both quickly failed. On November 21, a large party of about 22 persons successfully reached the peak. The party traveled about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} west of the summit, but this trip too was aborted, and they returned to the lake on November 23.\n\n[[File:Truckee Lake camp.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of the Truckee Lake camp based on descriptions by William Graves<ref group=upper-alpha>This drawing is inaccurate in several respects: the cabins were spread so far apart that Patrick Breen in his diary came to call inhabitants of other cabins \"strangers\" whose visits were rare. Furthermore, this scene shows a great deal of activity and livestock, when the migrants were weakened already by low rations and livestock began to die almost immediately. It also neglects to include the snow that met the migrants from the day they arrived.</ref>|alt=Three log cabins with flat roofs set in the midst of tall trees, with mountains in the background. People, livestock, and covered wagons are engaged in various activities in a clearing in the middle of the cabins.]]\n\nPatrick Breen began keeping a diary on November 20. He concerned himself primarily with the weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries.<ref>Rarick, p. 145.</ref> Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a \"disagreeable\" glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay in front of their fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it.<ref>McGlashan, p. 90.</ref> After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the migrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine.<ref>Rarick, p. 146.</ref> Migrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would be able to make the full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger.<ref>Johnson, p. 40. See also McGlashan letter from Leanna Donner, 1879.</ref> George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.<ref>Stewart, pp. 160\u2013167.</ref>\n\nMargret Reed had managed to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, to the delight of her children, but by January they were facing starvation and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning that it would be better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graves came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.<ref>Stewart, pp. 168\u2013175.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 148\u2013150.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===\"The Forlorn Hope\"===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members of \"The Forlorn Hope\"\n|-\n!

Spitzer died, then Baylis Williams (a driver for the Reeds) also died, more from malnutrition than starvation. Franklin Graves fashioned 14 pairs of [[snowshoe]]s out of [[oxbow]]s and hide. A party of 17 men, women, and children set out on foot in an attempt to cross the mountain pass.<ref>McGlashan pp. 66\u201367.</ref> As evidence of how grim their choices were, four of the men were fathers. Three of the women, who were mothers, gave their young children to other women.

The members of the party were neither well-nourished nor accustomed to camping in snow {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep and, by the third day, most were [[Snow blindness|snowblind]]. On the sixth day, Eddy discovered his wife had hidden a half-pound of bear meat in his pack. The group set out again the morning of December 21; Stanton had been straggling for several days, and he remained behind, saying he would follow shortly. His remains were found in that location the following year.<ref>Stewart, pp. 122\u2013125.</ref><ref name=rarick136>Rarick, p. 136.</ref>\n\nThe group became lost and confused. After two more days without food, Patrick Dolan proposed one of them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice.<ref name=rarick136/><ref>Thornton, J. Quinn, excerpt from ''Oregon and California in 1848'' (1849), published in Johnson, p. 52.</ref> Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt.

He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy. They dried them to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.<ref>Stewart, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref><ref>Thornton, J.

Eddy eventually succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began taking apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left.<ref>Thornton, J.

Reed made it out of the Sierra Nevada to [[Rancho Johnson]] in late October. He was safe and recovering at Sutter's Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company.

For example, Colonel Fr\u00e9mont's personnel were occupied at that precise time in capturing Santa Barbara. Throughout the region, roads were blocked, communications compromised, and supplies unavailable. Only three men responded to a call for volunteers to rescue the Donner Party. Reed was laid over in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] until February because of regional uprisings and general confusion. He spent that time speaking with other pioneers and acquaintances. The people of San Jose responded by creating a petition to appeal to the U.S. Navy to assist the people at Truckee Lake. Two local newspapers reported that members of the snowshoe party had resorted to cannibalism, which helped to foster sympathy for those who were still trapped. Residents of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], many of them recent migrants, raised $1,300 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1300|1847|r=-2}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}) and organized relief efforts to build two camps to supply a rescue party for the refugees.<ref>Stewart, pp. 150\u2013159.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nA rescue party including William Eddy started on February 4 from the Sacramento Valley. Rain and a swollen river forced several delays. Eddy stationed himself at Bear Valley, while the others made steady progress through the snow and storms to cross the pass to Truckee Lake, caching their food at stations along the way so they did not have to carry it all. Three of the rescue party turned back, but seven forged on.<ref>Stewart, pp. 176\u2013189.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref>\n\nOn February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Fr\u00e9mont Pass (now Donner Pass); as they neared where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy appeared from a hole in the snow, stared at them and asked, \"Are you men from California, or do you come from heaven?\"<ref>Stewart, p. 191.</ref> The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated migrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the migrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing \"such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description\".<ref>Rarick, p. 173.</ref> George Donner's arm was so [[gangrene|gangrenous]] he could not move.

Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a [[freemasonry|Mason]] that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, \"Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can.\"<ref>Stewart, p. 198.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 174.</ref> Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.<ref>Stewart, pp. 197\u2013203.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 178.</ref>\n\nAfter these rescued migrants made it safely into Bear Valley, William Hook, Jacob Donner's stepson, broke into food stores and fatally gorged himself. The others continued to Sutter's Fort, where Virginia Reed wrote, \"I really thought I had stepped over into paradise\". She was amused to note one of the young men asked her to marry him, although she was only 12 years old and recovering from starvation,<ref>Stewart, pp. 204\u2013206.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 187.</ref> but she turned him down.<ref>McGlashen, p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Second relief===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members rescued by second relief\n|-\n!

These rescuers included veteran [[Mountain man |mountain men]], most notably [[John Turner (fur trapper)|John Turner]],<ref>Stewart, p. 209</ref><ref>McGlashan, p. 161</ref> who accompanied the return of Reed and McCutchen. Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George Stewart, \"passed the limits of description and almost of imagination\". Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind. The children were listless and had not been cleaned in days. Lewis Keseberg had moved into the cabin and could barely move due to an injured leg.<ref>Stewart, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref>\n\nNo one at Truckee Lake had died during the interim between the departure of the first and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body.<ref>Stewart, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by their father's organs.<ref>Rarick, p. 191.</ref> The rescuers discovered three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.<ref>Stewart, pp. 215\u2013219.</ref>\n\n[[File:Donner Lake and snow sheds2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lake beside snowy mountains with railroad construction sheds in foreground|View of Truckee Lake from Donner Pass, taken in 1868 as the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] reached completion]]\n\nThe second relief evacuated 17 migrants from Truckee Lake, only three of whom were adults. Both the Breen and Graves families prepared to go. Only five people remained at Truckee Lake: Keseberg, Mrs. Murphy and her son Simon, and the young Eddy and Foster children. Tamsen Donner elected to stay with her ailing husband after Reed informed her that a third relief party would arrive soon. Mrs. Donner kept her daughters Eliza, Georgia, and Frances with her.<ref>Rarick, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe walk back to Bear Valley was very slow. At one point, Reed sent two men ahead to retrieve the first cache of food, expecting the third relief, a small party led by [[Selim E. Woodworth]], to come at any moment. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days.

Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the ''[[alcalde]]'' near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. These would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On their way back to Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night.\n\nThe salvage party was suspicious of Keseberg's story and found a pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold.

Mary Graves married early, but her first husband was murdered. She cooked his killer's food while he was in prison to ensure the condemned man did not starve before his hanging.

He attempted to follow through on his promise to murder Lewis Keseberg but was dissuaded by James Reed and Edwin Bryant. A year later, Eddy recalled his experiences to J.

The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the ''California Star'' described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party. It reported that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw.

The attention directed at the Donner Party is made possible by reliable accounts of what occurred, according to Stewart, and the fact that \"the cannibalism, although it might almost be called a minor episode, has become in the popular mind the chief fact to be remembered about the Donner Party. For a taboo always allures with as great strength as it repels\".<ref>Stewart, p. 295.</ref> The appeal is the events focused on families and ordinary people, according to Johnson, writing in 1996, instead of on rare individuals, and that the events are \"a dreadful irony that hopes of prosperity, health, and a new life in California's fertile valleys led many only to misery, hunger, and death on her stony threshold\".<ref>Johnson, p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe site of the cabins became a tourist attraction as early as 1854.<ref>State of California, p. 43.</ref> In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting the idea of a monument to mark the site of the Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family, dedicated to the Donner Party, was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have stood.<ref name=rarick243and244>Rarick, pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.<ref>State of California, p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe State of California created the [[Donner Memorial State Park]] in 1927. It originally consisted of {{convert|11|acre|km2}} surrounding the monument. Twenty years later, the site of the Murphy cabin was purchased and added to the park.<ref>State of California, p. 45.</ref> In 1962, the Emigrant Trail Museum was added to tell the history of westward migration into California. The Murphy cabin and Donner monument were established as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963. A large rock served as the back-end of the fireplace of the Murphy cabin, and a bronze plaque has been affixed to the rock listing the members of the Donner Party, indicating who survived and who did not.

Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation,<ref name=hardesty114>Hardesty, p. 114.</ref> such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5&nbsp;years younger than those who died; children aged between six and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and children under the age of six, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were \"extremely high\" among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent.<ref name=GraysonAutumn1990/> Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks, and in this particular instance, the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.<ref name=mccurdy>McCurdy, Stephen (1994).

Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book ''History of the Donner Party'' declined to include some of the more morbid details\u2014such as the suffering of the children and infants before death\u2014or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.<ref>Stewart, pp. 307\u2013313.</ref><ref>McGlashan, p. 161.</ref> The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846\u20131847) it was given only to the youngest children: \"Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else.\" She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster.<ref>Stewart, p. 312.</ref> Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.\n\nArchaeological findings at the Alder Creek camp proved inconclusive for evidence of cannibalism. None of the bones tested at the Alder Creek cooking hearth could be identified with certainty as human.<ref>Dixon et al., 2010; Robbins Schug and Gray, 2011</ref> According to Rarick, only cooked bones would be preserved, and it is unlikely that the Donner Party members would have needed to cook human bones.<ref>Rarick, p. 193.</ref>\n\nEliza Farnham's 1856 account of the Donner Party was based largely on an interview with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted that she and her family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph King\u2014whose account is sympathetic to the Breen family\u2014do not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, would have been able to survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this in her account independently of Margaret Breen.<ref>Farnham, Eliza, excerpt from ''California, In-doors and Out'' (1856), published in Johnson, pp. 139\u2013168.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 164., Rarick, p. 213, King, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nAccording to an account published by H.

He reiterated this in an interview with a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, despite their circumstances and the fact that he eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners.<ref>Stewart, p. 297.</ref> Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of \"common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders\"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton.<ref>Johnson, p. 133.</ref> Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion \"extravagant moralism\", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices.<ref>King, Joseph; Steed, Jack (Summer 1995). \"John Baptiste Trudeau of the Donner Party: Rascal or Hero?\", ''California History'' '''74''' (2) pp. 162\u2013173.</ref> Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, \"more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous\".<ref>Rarick, p. 245.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Donner Party timeline]]\n*[[List of incidents of cannibalism]]\n*[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Andes flight disaster]]\n*[[Alferd Packer]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|16em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Bagley, Will (2010), ''So Rugged and So Mountainous: Blazing the Trails to Oregon and California, 1812\u20131848'', [[University of Oklahoma Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4103-9}}\n* Dixon, Kelly, Shannon Novak, Gwen Robbins, Julie Schablitsky, Richard Scott, and Guy Tasa (2010), \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20170811103950/https://www.unr.edu/Documents/liberal-arts/anthropology/Scott/Dixon%20et%20al.pdf Men, Women, and Children are Starving: Archaeology of the Donner Family Camp]\".

Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846\u201347 snowbound in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. Some of the migrants resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive, eating the bodies of those who had succumbed to starvation and sickness.\n\nThe Donner Party departed [[Missouri]] on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the spring of 1846, behind many other pioneer families who were attempting to make the same overland trip. The journey west usually took between four and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed after electing to follow a new route called the [[Hastings Cutoff]], which bypassed established trails and instead crossed [[Utah]]'s [[Wasatch Mountains]] and the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]]. The desolate and rugged terrain, and the difficulties they later encountered while traveling along the [[Humboldt River]] in present-day [[Nevada]], resulted in the loss of many cattle and wagons, and divisions soon formed within the group.\n\nBy early November, the migrants had reached the Sierra Nevada but became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]) high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran dangerously low, and in mid-December some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the migrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived the ordeal. Historians have described the episode as one of the most spectacular tragedies in California history, and in the entire record of American westward migration.<ref>McGlashan, p. 16; Stewart, p. 271.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Humboldt River Papa 2.jpg|thumb|An encampment of tents and covered wagons on the [[Humboldt River]] in Nevada, 1859]]<!-- needs [[WP:ALT]] -->\nDuring the 1840s, the United States saw a dramatic increase in settlers who left their homes in the east to resettle in the [[Oregon Territory]] or California, which at the time were only accessible by a very long sea voyage or a daunting overland journey across the American frontier. Some, such as Patrick Breen, saw California as a place where they would be free to live in a fully Catholic culture;<ref name=Enright1954>Enright, John Shea (December 1954). \"The Breens of San Juan Bautista: With a Calendar of Family Papers\", ''[[California Historical Society Quarterly]]'' '''33''' (4) pp. 349\u2013359.</ref> others were attracted to the West's burgeoning economic opportunities or inspired by the idea of [[manifest destiny]], the belief that the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans belonged to European Americans and that they should settle it.<ref>Rarick, p. 11.</ref> Most wagon trains followed the [[Oregon Trail]] route from a starting point in [[Independence, Missouri]], to the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], traveling about {{convert|15|mi}} a day<ref name=rarick18and24and45>Rarick, pp. 18, 24, 45.</ref> on a journey that usually took between four and six months.<ref name=bagley130>Bagley, p. 130.</ref> The trail generally followed rivers to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], a [[mountain pass]] in present-day [[Wyoming]] which was relatively easy for wagons to negotiate.<ref name=rarick48>Rarick, p. 48.</ref> From there, pioneers had a choice of routes to their destinations.<ref name=rarick45>Rarick, p. 45.</ref>\n\n[[Lansford Hastings]], an early migrant from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 and saw the promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published ''The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California''.<ref name=rarick47/> As an alternative to the Oregon Trail's standard route through [[Idaho]]'s [[Snake River Plain]], he proposed a more direct route (which actually increased the trip's mileage) to California across the [[Great Basin]], which would take travelers through the [[Wasatch Range]] and across the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]].<ref name=rarick69/> Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to [[Fort Bridger]]. The fort was a scant supply station run by [[Jim Bridger]] and his partner [[Louis Vasquez]] in [[Blacks Fork]], Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route.<ref name=rarick47>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed the southern part of the Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.<ref name=rarick69/><ref group=upper-alpha>There are no written records of native tribes having crossed the desert, nor did the migrants mention any existing trails in this region.

Levinah Murphy (37), a widow from Tennessee, headed a family of thirteen. Her five youngest children were: John Landrum (16), Meriam (\"Mary\", 14), Lemuel (12), William (10), and Simon (8).

(32) and their daughters Naomi (3) and Catherine (1). William H. Eddy (28), a carriage maker from Illinois, brought his wife Eleanor (25) and their two children, James (3) and Margaret (1). The Breen family consisted of Patrick Breen (51), a farmer from Iowa, his wife Margaret (\"Peggy\", 40), and seven children: John (14), Edward (13), Patrick, Jr. (9), Simon (8), James (5), Peter (3), and 11-month-old Isabelle.

On July 12, the Reeds and Donners were given one of them.<ref>Johnson, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Hastings warned the migrants they could expect opposition from the Mexican authorities in California and advised them to band together in large groups. He also claimed to have \"worked out a new and better road to California\", and said he would be waiting at Fort Bridger to guide the migrants along the new cutoff.<ref name=Andrews1973>Andrews, Thomas F. (April 1973). \"Lansford W. Hastings and the Promotion of the Great Salt Lake Cutoff: A Reappraisal\", ''[[The Western Historical Quarterly]]'' '''4''' (2) pp. 133\u2013150.</ref>\n\n[[File:Donner route map.png|thumb|500px|right|Map of the route taken by the Donner Party, showing the [[Hastings Cutoff]]\u2014which added {{convert|150|mi|km}} to their travels\u2014in orange]]\nOn July 20, at the Little Sandy River, most of the wagon train opted to follow the established trail via [[Fort Hall]]. A smaller group opted to head for Fort Bridger and needed a leader. Most of the younger men in the group were European immigrants and not considered to be ideal leaders. James Reed had lived in the U.S. for a considerable time, was older, and had military experience, but his autocratic attitude had rubbed many in the party the wrong way, and they saw him as aristocratic, imperious, and ostentatious.<ref>Stewart, pp. 16\u201318.</ref> By comparison, the mature, experienced, American-born Donner's peaceful and charitable nature made him the group's first choice.<ref>Stewart, p. 14.</ref> The members of the party were comfortably well-off by contemporaneous standards.<ref name=rarick17/> Although they are called pioneers, most of the party lacked skills and experience for traveling through mountains and arid land. Additionally, the party had little knowledge about how to interact with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>Stewart, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Edwin Bryant (alcalde)|Edwin Bryant]] reached Blacks Fork a week ahead of the Donner Party. He saw the first part of the trail and was concerned that it would be difficult for the wagons in the Donner group, especially with so many women and children. He returned to Blacks Fork to leave letters warning several members of the group not to take Hastings' shortcut.<ref>Rarick, p. 56.</ref> By the time the Donner Party reached Blacks Fork on July 27, Hastings had already left, leading the forty wagons of the Harlan-Young group.<ref name=Andrews1973/> Because Jim Bridger's trading post would fare substantially better if people used the Hastings Cutoff, he told the party that the shortcut was a smooth trip, devoid of rugged country and hostile Native Americans, and would therefore shorten their journey by {{convert|350|mi|km}}. Water would be easy to find along the way, although a couple of days crossing a {{convert|30|\u2013|40|mi|km|adj=on}} dry lake bed would be necessary.\n\nReed was very impressed with this information and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.<ref name=Andrews1973/><ref>Stewart, pp. 25\u201327; Rarick, p. 58.</ref> At Fort Laramie, Reed met an old friend named James Clyman who was coming from California. Clyman warned Reed not to take the Hastings Cutoff, telling him that wagons would not be able to make it and that Hastings' information was inaccurate.<ref>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> Fellow pioneer [[Jesse Quinn Thornton]] traveled part of the way with Donner and Reed, and in his book ''From Oregon and California in 1848'' declared Hastings the \"[[Baron Munchausen]] of travelers in these countries\".<ref>Johnson, p. 20</ref> Tamsen Donner, according to Thornton, was \"gloomy, sad, and dispirited\" at the thought of turning off the main trail on the advice of Hastings, whom she considered \"a selfish adventurer\".<ref>Johnson, p. 22.</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 1846, the party left Blacks Fork after four days of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan-Young group. Donner hired a replacement driver, and the company was joined by the McCutcheon family, consisting of 30-year-old William, his 24-year-old wife Amanda, two-year-old daughter Harriet, and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, who claimed to have knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain on the way to California.<ref>Stewart, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Wasatch Mountains===\n[[File:Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah.JPG|thumb|Big Cottonwood Canyon, located several miles south of the Donner route in the heart of the Wasatch mountains of Northern Utah]]\n\nThe party turned south to follow the Hastings Cutoff. Within days, they found the terrain to be much more difficult than described. Drivers were forced to lock the wheels of their wagons to prevent them from rolling down steep inclines. Several years of traffic on the main Oregon Trail had left an easy and obvious path, whereas the Cutoff was more difficult to find. Hastings wrote directions and left letters stuck to trees. On August 6, the party found a letter from him advising them to stop until he could show them an alternate route to that taken by the Harlan-Young Party.<ref group=upper-alpha>While Hastings was otherwise occupied, his guides had led the Harlan-Young Party through [[Weber Canyon]], which was not the route that Hastings had intended to take. (Rarick, p. 61)</ref> Reed, Charles T. Stanton, and William Pike rode ahead to get Hastings. They encountered exceedingly difficult canyons where boulders had to be moved and walls cut off precariously to a river below, a route likely to break wagons. In his letter Hastings had offered to guide the Donner Party around the more difficult areas, but he rode back only part way, indicating the general direction to follow.<ref>Stewart, pp. 31\u201335.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nStanton and Pike stopped to rest, and Reed returned alone to the group, arriving four days after the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of [[Weber Canyon]], or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route.<ref>Rarick, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Their progress slowed to about one and a half miles (2.4 km) a day. All able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.<ref group=upper-alpha>The route that the party followed is now known as [[Emigration Canyon, Utah|Emigration Canyon]]. (Johnson, p. 28)</ref>\n\nAs the Donner Party made its way across the [[Wasatch Mountains]], the Graves family, who had set off to find them, reached them. They consisted of 57-year-old Franklin Ward Graves, his 47-year-old wife Elizabeth, their children Mary (20), William (18), Eleanor (15), Lovina (13), Nancy (9), Jonathan (7), Franklin, Jr. (5), Elizabeth (1), and married daughter Sarah (22), plus son-in-law Jay Fosdick (23), and a 25-year-old teamster named John Snyder, traveling together in three wagons. Their arrival brought the Donner Party to 87 members in 60\u201380 wagons.<ref>Rarick, pp. 67\u201368, Johnson, p. 25.</ref> The Graves family had been part of the last group to leave Missouri, confirming the Donner Party was at the back of the year's western exodus.<ref name=rarick68>Rarick, p. 68.</ref>\n\nIt was August 20 by the time that they reached a point in the mountains where they could look down and see the [[Great Salt Lake]]. It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Mountains. The men began arguing, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular James Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families. Stanton and Pike had ridden out with Reed but had become lost on their way back; by the time that the party found them, they were a day away from eating their horses.<ref>Stewart, pp. 36\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Great Salt Lake Desert===\n[[File:Butte in Great Salt Lake Desert-750px.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Flat expanse with a mountain range in the distance|[[Great Salt Lake Desert]]]]\n\nLuke Halloran died of [[tuberculosis]] on August 25. A few days later, the party came across a torn and tattered letter from Hastings. The pieces indicated there were two days and nights of difficult travel ahead without grass or water. The party rested their oxen and prepared for the trip.<ref name=rarick70and71>Rarick, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> After 36&nbsp;hours they set off to traverse a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain that lay in their path. From its peak, they saw ahead of them a dry, barren plain, perfectly flat and covered with white salt, larger than the one they had just crossed,<ref name=stewart40to44/> and \"one of the most inhospitable places on earth\" according to Rarick.<ref name=rarick69>Rarick, p. 69.</ref> Their oxen were already fatigued, and their water was nearly gone.<ref name=stewart40to44>Stewart, pp. 40\u201344.</ref>\n\nThe party pressed onward on August 30, having no alternative. In the heat of the day, the moisture underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned it into a gummy mass. The wagon wheels sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains and believed they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The rigors of the journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost. Instead of the promised two-day journey over {{convert|40|mi}}, the journey across the {{convert|80|mi}} of [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] had taken six.<ref>Stewart, pp. 44\u201350.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>In 1986, a team of archaeologists attempted to cross the same stretch of desert at the same time of year in four-wheel drive trucks and were unable to do so. (Rarick, p. 71)</ref>\n\nNone of the party had any remaining faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs on the other side of the desert.<ref group=upper-alpha>The location has since been named Donner Spring where the Donner Party recuperated, at the base of [[Pilot Peak (Nevada)|Pilot Peak]]. (Johnson, p. 31)</ref> They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons.<ref group=upper-alpha>Reed's account states that many of the travelers lost cattle and were trying to locate them, although some of the other members thought that they were looking for his cattle. (Rarick, p. 74, Reed's own account \"The Snow-Bound, Starved Emigrants of 1846 Statement by Mr. Reed, One of the Donner Company\" in Johnson, p. 190)</ref> Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to [[Sutter's Fort]] in California; he had heard that [[John Sutter]] was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip.<ref>Rarick, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another {{convert|40|mi}} of [[Lahontan Valley|desert]] lay ahead.<ref name=stewart50to53>Stewart, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nTheir cattle and oxen were now exhausted and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed. The journey seemed to get easier, particularly through the valley next to the [[Ruby Mountains]]. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, they had no choice but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the [[Humboldt River]]. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\">Stewart, pp. 54\u201358.</ref><ref name=rarick80and81>Rarick, pp. 78\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Rejoining the trail==\n\n===Reed banished===\n\nAlong the Humboldt, the group met [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Native Americans, who joined them for a couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner families split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him.

The company pressed on to cross the Sierra Nevada before the snows came.

Luis and Salvador, both Consumne, were Catholic converts employed by John Sutter. Historian Joseph King deduced that Luis' given Miwok name was Eema. He was probably 19 years old in 1846. Salvador's given name was probably Qu\u00e9Yuen, and he would have been 28 years old the same year. (King, Joseph A.

Both the pass and the lake are now called Donner.]]\n\nFaced with one last push over mountains that were described as much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had to decide whether to forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently,<ref>Johnson, p. 43.</ref> an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then the Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graves, and the Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of their wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood but it seemed a superficial wound.<ref>Stewart, pp. 81\u201383.</ref>\n\nSnow began to fall. The Breens made it up the \"massive, nearly vertical slope\" {{convert|1000|ft|m}} to Truckee Lake (now known as [[Donner Lake]]), {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the summit, and camped near a cabin that had been built two years earlier by another group of pioneers.<ref>Rarick, p. 108.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>The cabins were built by three members of another group of migrants known as the Stevens Party, specifically by Joseph Foster, Allen Stevens, and Moses Schallenberger in November 1844.

They turned back for Truckee Lake and, within a day, all the families were camped there except for the Donners, who were {{convert|5|mi|km}} below them\u2014half a day's journey. Over the next few days, several more attempts were made to breach the pass with their wagons and animals, but all efforts failed.{{-}}\n\n===Winter camp===\n[[File:Map of Truckee Lake and Alder Creek.svg|thumb|right|350 px|Map showing the Truckee Lake and Alder Creek sites]]\n\nSixty members and associates of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families set up for the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and the Murphys another, and the Reeds and the Graves the third. Keseberg built a [[lean-to]] for his family against the side of the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, six of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: six men, three women, and twelve children in all.<ref>Stewart, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref><ref>Hardesty, p. 60.</ref> It began to snow again on the evening of November 4\u2014the beginning of a storm that lasted eight days.<ref>Stewart, pp. 84\u201387.</ref>\n\nBy the time the party made camp, very little food remained from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter's Fort. The oxen began to die, and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had little luck after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything. Margret Reed promised to pay double when they got to California for the use of three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25\u2014normally the cost of two healthy oxen\u2014for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.<ref>Stewart, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 44.</ref>\n\nDesperation grew in camp and some reasoned that individuals might succeed in navigating the pass where the wagons could not. On November 12, the storm abated, and a small party tried to reach the summit on foot but found the trek through the soft, deep powder too difficult, and returned that same evening. Over the next week, two more attempts were made by other small parties, but both quickly failed. On November 21, a large party of about 22 persons successfully reached the peak. The party traveled about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} west of the summit, but this trip too was aborted, and they returned to the lake on November 23.\n\n[[File:Truckee Lake camp.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of the Truckee Lake camp based on descriptions by William Graves<ref group=upper-alpha>This drawing is inaccurate in several respects: the cabins were spread so far apart that Patrick Breen in his diary came to call inhabitants of other cabins \"strangers\" whose visits were rare. Furthermore, this scene shows a great deal of activity and livestock, when the migrants were weakened already by low rations and livestock began to die almost immediately. It also neglects to include the snow that met the migrants from the day they arrived.</ref>|alt=Three log cabins with flat roofs set in the midst of tall trees, with mountains in the background. People, livestock, and covered wagons are engaged in various activities in a clearing in the middle of the cabins.]]\n\nPatrick Breen began keeping a diary on November 20. He concerned himself primarily with the weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries.<ref>Rarick, p. 145.</ref> Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a \"disagreeable\" glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay in front of their fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it.<ref>McGlashan, p. 90.</ref> After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the migrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine.<ref>Rarick, p. 146.</ref> Migrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would be able to make the full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger.<ref>Johnson, p. 40. See also McGlashan letter from Leanna Donner, 1879.</ref> George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.<ref>Stewart, pp. 160\u2013167.</ref>\n\nMargret Reed had managed to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, to the delight of her children, but by January they were facing starvation and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning that it would be better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graves came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.<ref>Stewart, pp. 168\u2013175.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 148\u2013150.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===\"The Forlorn Hope\"===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members of \"The Forlorn Hope\"\n|-\n!

Spitzer died, then Baylis Williams (a driver for the Reeds) also died, more from malnutrition than starvation. Franklin Graves fashioned 14 pairs of [[snowshoe]]s out of [[oxbow]]s and hide. A party of 17 men, women, and children set out on foot in an attempt to cross the mountain pass.<ref>McGlashan pp. 66\u201367.</ref> As evidence of how grim their choices were, four of the men were fathers. Three of the women, who were mothers, gave their young children to other women.

The members of the party were neither well-nourished nor accustomed to camping in snow {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep and, by the third day, most were [[Snow blindness|snowblind]]. On the sixth day, Eddy discovered his wife had hidden a half-pound of bear meat in his pack. The group set out again the morning of December 21; Stanton had been straggling for several days, and he remained behind, saying he would follow shortly.

After two more days without food, Patrick Dolan proposed one of them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice.<ref name=rarick136/><ref>Thornton, J. Quinn, excerpt from ''Oregon and California in 1848'' (1849), published in Johnson, p. 52.</ref> Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt.

He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy. They dried them to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.<ref>Stewart, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref><ref>Thornton, J.

Eddy eventually succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began taking apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left.<ref>Thornton, J.

For example, Colonel Fr\u00e9mont's personnel were occupied at that precise time in capturing Santa Barbara. Throughout the region, roads were blocked, communications compromised, and supplies unavailable. Only three men responded to a call for volunteers to rescue the Donner Party. Reed was laid over in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] until February because of regional uprisings and general confusion. He spent that time speaking with other pioneers and acquaintances. The people of San Jose responded by creating a petition to appeal to the U.S. Navy to assist the people at Truckee Lake. Two local newspapers reported that members of the snowshoe party had resorted to cannibalism, which helped to foster sympathy for those who were still trapped. Residents of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], many of them recent migrants, raised $1,300 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1300|1847|r=-2}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}) and organized relief efforts to build two camps to supply a rescue party for the refugees.<ref>Stewart, pp. 150\u2013159.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nA rescue party including William Eddy started on February 4 from the Sacramento Valley. Rain and a swollen river forced several delays. Eddy stationed himself at Bear Valley, while the others made steady progress through the snow and storms to cross the pass to Truckee Lake, caching their food at stations along the way so they did not have to carry it all. Three of the rescue party turned back, but seven forged on.<ref>Stewart, pp. 176\u2013189.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref>\n\nOn February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Fr\u00e9mont Pass (now Donner Pass); as they neared where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy appeared from a hole in the snow, stared at them and asked, \"Are you men from California, or do you come from heaven?\"<ref>Stewart, p. 191.</ref> The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated migrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the migrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing \"such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description\".<ref>Rarick, p. 173.</ref> George Donner's arm was so [[gangrene|gangrenous]] he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving twenty-one in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.<ref>Stewart, pp. 190\u2013196.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 170.</ref>\n\nThe rescuers concealed the fate of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued migrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten.<ref>Rarick, p. 171.</ref> Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a [[freemasonry|Mason]] that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, \"Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can.\"<ref>Stewart, p. 198.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 174.</ref> Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed.

These rescuers included veteran [[Mountain man |mountain men]], most notably [[John Turner (fur trapper)|John Turner]],<ref>Stewart, p. 209</ref><ref>McGlashan, p. 161</ref> who accompanied the return of Reed and McCutchen. Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George Stewart, \"passed the limits of description and almost of imagination\". Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind. The children were listless and had not been cleaned in days. Lewis Keseberg had moved into the cabin and could barely move due to an injured leg.<ref>Stewart, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref>\n\nNo one at Truckee Lake had died during the interim between the departure of the first and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body.<ref>Stewart, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by their father's organs.<ref>Rarick, p. 191.</ref> The rescuers discovered three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.<ref>Stewart, pp. 215\u2013219.</ref>\n\n[[File:Donner Lake and snow sheds2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lake beside snowy mountains with railroad construction sheds in foreground|View of Truckee Lake from Donner Pass, taken in 1868 as the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] reached completion]]\n\nThe second relief evacuated 17 migrants from Truckee Lake, only three of whom were adults. Both the Breen and Graves families prepared to go. Only five people remained at Truckee Lake: Keseberg, Mrs. Murphy and her son Simon, and the young Eddy and Foster children. Tamsen Donner elected to stay with her ailing husband after Reed informed her that a third relief party would arrive soon. Mrs. Donner kept her daughters Eliza, Georgia, and Frances with her.<ref>Rarick, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe walk back to Bear Valley was very slow. At one point, Reed sent two men ahead to retrieve the first cache of food, expecting the third relief, a small party led by [[Selim E. Woodworth]], to come at any moment. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party had no choice but to leave without them.<ref>Stewart, pp. 220\u2013230.</ref><ref>Reed, James \"The Snow Bound Starved Emigrants of 1846 Statement by Mr. Reed, One of the Donner Company\" (1871), in Johnson, p. 199.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 199\u2013203.</ref>\n\n<!---the following paragraph is nearly incomprehensible; it needs to be made more clear as to who did what to whom and when and why--->\nThree members of the relief party stayed, one at Truckee Lake and two at Alder Creek. When one, Nicholas Clark, went hunting, the other two, Charles Cady and Charles Stone, made plans to return to California. According to Stewart, Tamsen Donner arranged for them to carry three of her children to California, perhaps for $500 cash. Cady and Stone took the children to Truckee Lake but then left alone, overtaking Reed and the others within days.<ref>Stewart, pp. 231\u2013236.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 207\u2013208.</ref> Several days later, Clark and Trudeau agreed to leave together.

After one day, they met Reed helping his children, all frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save the healthiest, each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. He picked up two children and all the provisions and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graves to Bear Valley.<ref>Stewart, pp. 237\u2013246.</ref><ref>King, pp. 92\u201393.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 214\u2013215.</ref>\n\n===Third relief===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members rescued by third relief\n|-\n!

Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the ''[[alcalde]]'' near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. These would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On their way back to Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night.\n\nThe salvage party was suspicious of Keseberg's story and found a pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. The men threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, so that it could one day benefit her children.<ref>Stewart, pp. 258\u2013265.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 222\u2013226.</ref> On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.\n\n===Response===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 30em\n| quote = A more revolting or appalling spectacle I never witnessed.

He attempted to follow through on his promise to murder Lewis Keseberg but was dissuaded by James Reed and Edwin Bryant. A year later, Eddy recalled his experiences to J.

The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the ''California Star'' described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party. It reported that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw.

The attention directed at the Donner Party is made possible by reliable accounts of what occurred, according to Stewart, and the fact that \"the cannibalism, although it might almost be called a minor episode, has become in the popular mind the chief fact to be remembered about the Donner Party. For a taboo always allures with as great strength as it repels\".<ref>Stewart, p. 295.</ref> The appeal is the events focused on families and ordinary people, according to Johnson, writing in 1996, instead of on rare individuals, and that the events are \"a dreadful irony that hopes of prosperity, health, and a new life in California's fertile valleys led many only to misery, hunger, and death on her stony threshold\".<ref>Johnson, p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe site of the cabins became a tourist attraction as early as 1854.<ref>State of California, p. 43.</ref> In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting the idea of a monument to mark the site of the Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family, dedicated to the Donner Party, was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have stood.<ref name=rarick243and244>Rarick, pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.<ref>State of California, p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe State of California created the [[Donner Memorial State Park]] in 1927.

The Murphy cabin and Donner monument were established as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963. A large rock served as the back-end of the fireplace of the Murphy cabin, and a bronze plaque has been affixed to the rock listing the members of the Donner Party, indicating who survived and who did not.

Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation,<ref name=hardesty114>Hardesty, p. 114.</ref> such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5&nbsp;years younger than those who died; children aged between six and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and children under the age of six, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were \"extremely high\" among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent.<ref name=GraysonAutumn1990/> Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks, and in this particular instance, the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.<ref name=mccurdy>McCurdy, Stephen (1994).

Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book ''History of the Donner Party'' declined to include some of the more morbid details\u2014such as the suffering of the children and infants before death\u2014or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.<ref>Stewart, pp. 307\u2013313.</ref><ref>McGlashan, p. 161.</ref> The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846\u20131847) it was given only to the youngest children: \"Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else.\" She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster.<ref>Stewart, p. 312.</ref> Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.\n\nArchaeological findings at the Alder Creek camp proved inconclusive for evidence of cannibalism. None of the bones tested at the Alder Creek cooking hearth could be identified with certainty as human.<ref>Dixon et al., 2010; Robbins Schug and Gray, 2011</ref> According to Rarick, only cooked bones would be preserved, and it is unlikely that the Donner Party members would have needed to cook human bones.<ref>Rarick, p. 193.</ref>\n\nEliza Farnham's 1856 account of the Donner Party was based largely on an interview with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted that she and her family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph King\u2014whose account is sympathetic to the Breen family\u2014do not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, would have been able to survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this in her account independently of Margaret Breen.<ref>Farnham, Eliza, excerpt from ''California, In-doors and Out'' (1856), published in Johnson, pp. 139\u2013168.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 164., Rarick, p. 213, King, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nAccording to an account published by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted of his own heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and said he had eaten a baby raw.<ref>Wise, H. A., excerpt from ''Los Gringos'' (1849), published in Johnson, pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone. He reiterated this in an interview with a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, despite their circumstances and the fact that he eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners.<ref>Stewart, p. 297.</ref> Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of \"common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders\"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton.<ref>Johnson, p. 133.</ref> Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion \"extravagant moralism\", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices.<ref>King, Joseph; Steed, Jack (Summer 1995). \"John Baptiste Trudeau of the Donner Party: Rascal or Hero?\", ''California History'' '''74''' (2) pp. 162\u2013173.</ref> Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, \"more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous\".<ref>Rarick, p. 245.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Donner Party timeline]]\n*[[List of incidents of cannibalism]]\n*[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Andes flight disaster]]\n*[[Alferd Packer]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|16em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Bagley, Will (2010), ''So Rugged and So Mountainous: Blazing the Trails to Oregon and California, 1812\u20131848'', [[University of Oklahoma Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4103-9}}\n* Dixon, Kelly, Shannon Novak, Gwen Robbins, Julie Schablitsky, Richard Scott, and Guy Tasa (2010), \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20170811103950/https://www.unr.edu/Documents/liberal-arts/anthropology/Scott/Dixon%20et%20al.pdf Men, Women, and Children are Starving: Archaeology of the Donner Family Camp]\".

Bol played for the Bullets and three other teams over the course of his NBA career, which lasted from 1985 to 1995. A [[center (basketball)|center]], Bol was considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport; however, other aspects of his game were considered below average. \n\nBol is the only NBA player to retire with more career blocked shots than points scored. {{As of|2020}}, he ranked second in NBA history in [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] per game and 16th in [[List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders|total blocked shots]].\n\nBol was notable for his efforts to promote human rights in his native Sudan and aid for Sudanese refugees.\n\n==Early life==\nManute Bol was born to Madute and Okwok Bol in Turalei or Gogrial, Sudan (now South Sudan) and raised near Gogrial.

Feeley eventually convinced Bol to go to the United States and play basketball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/manute-bol|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://plus2clothing.com/happened-manute-bol/|title=What Happened to Manute Bol|first=Steve|last=Rogers|date=7 April 2016|website=Plus 2 Clothing}}</ref>\n\nWith Feeley's input, Bol first landed in [[Cleveland]]. According to [[Cleveland State University]] basketball coach [[Kevin Mackey]], Bol could not provide a record of his birth date. Mackey listed it as October 16, 1962 on Cleveland State documents, but believed Bol was actually much older.<ref name=\"NYDN birthday\"/><ref name=\"Y birthday\"/><ref name=\"cbssports.com\"/> Bol did not speak or write English at the time of his arrival in Cleveland. He improved his English skills after months of classes at [[ELS Language Centers]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]], but not enough to qualify for enrollment at Cleveland State. Bol never played a game for Cleveland State. (Five years later, Cleveland State was placed on two years' probation for providing improper financial assistance to Bol and two other African players.)<ref>{{cite news |last = Associated Press |title = Penalties Upheld for Cleveland State |newspaper = The New York Times |pages = |date = Apr 22, 1988 |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9173AF931A15757C0A96E948260 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1985-02-20-8501060790-story.html|title=THE KING DINKA DUNKER: 7\u20136 HERDSMAN TO NBA?|first=Mitch Albom|last=Columnist|website=Sun-Sentinel.com}}</ref>\n\nAgain with Feeley's influence, Bol declared his intention to play professionally in the NBA. The [[Los Angeles Clippers]] drafted him in the fifth round of the [[1983 NBA draft]] (97th overall). Clippers Coach [[Jim Lynam]] received a call about Bol from Feeley, whom he knew from coaching circles. \"So, I said, 'Have you told anyone else about this?'\", Lynam recalled. \"Feeley said the only one in the NBA he had called was Frank Layden at Utah. He said Frank said he couldn't take another big guy like this. He already had Mark Eaton. I was the second guy Feeley had called. I told him he didn't have to call anyone else.\"<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1990/12/17/123285/a-tall-story-manute-bol-the-sixers-7-ft7-in-center-views-life-from-a-unique-perspective|title=A TALL STORY|first=Leigh|last=Montville|website=Vault}}</ref>\n\nAfter the June 1983 draft, Lynam traveled to Cleveland and watched Bol play pickup games. In speaking with Bol, through a fellow Sudanese player, Lynam learned that he had become hesitant about playing professionally because he did not know the language well enough to understand coaches.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Lynam said, \"One of the things everyone was looking at was his passport. His passport said he was 19 years old. His passport also said he was five feet two.\" When Lynam asked Bol about the discrepancy between his real height and his passport height, Bol said he had been sitting down when measured by Sudan officials.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nLanguage and passport concerns were set aside when the NBA ruled that Bol had not been eligible for the draft and declared the pick invalid. Bol had not declared 45 days before the draft as required.<ref name=\"USAToday\">{{cite news|title=Scouts: Bol has slim chance at success|date=April 12, 1985|first=Kathy|last=Blumenstock|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=}}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the NCAA questioning his eligibility for [[NCAA Division I]] basketball, Bol enrolled at the [[University of Bridgeport]], an [[NCAA Division II]] school with an English program for foreign students. There he played for the Purple Knights in the 1984\u201385 season. His coach was [[Bruce Webster]], a friend of Feeley. Bol averaged 22.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.1 blocks per game for Bridgeport.

Listed at {{height|ft=7|in=6}} tall, Bol was one of the tallest players in the history of the [[National Basketball Association]].<ref name=\"MBNBA\"/>\n\nAfter playing college basketball at the [[University of Bridgeport]], Bol was chosen by the [[Washington Bullets]] in the 1985 NBA Draft. Bol played for the Bullets and three other teams over the course of his NBA career, which lasted from 1985 to 1995. A [[center (basketball)|center]], Bol was considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport; however, other aspects of his game were considered below average. \n\nBol is the only NBA player to retire with more career blocked shots than points scored. {{As of|2020}}, he ranked second in NBA history in [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] per game and 16th in [[List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders|total blocked shots]].\n\nBol was notable for his efforts to promote human rights in his native Sudan and aid for Sudanese refugees.\n\n==Early life==\nManute Bol was born to Madute and Okwok Bol in Turalei or Gogrial, Sudan (now South Sudan) and raised near Gogrial. Bol's father, a [[Dinka people|Dinka]] tribal elder, gave him the name Manute, which means \"special blessing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2002-03-31-0203310024-story.html|title=FOR MANUTE BOL, A HARROWING COMEBACK|first=LYNNE TUOHY; Courant Staff|last=Writer|date=|website=courant.com|accessdate=7 February 2019}}</ref> Bol had no formal record of his birthdate.<ref name=\"NYDN birthday\">{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Stefan|title=Manute Bol lied about his age, may have been 50 years old when he played in the NBA: report|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/manute-bol-lied-age-50-played-nba-article-1.3649488|website=NY Daily News|accessdate=November 22, 2017|date=November 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Y birthday\">{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/manute-bols-birthday-allegedly-made-mightve-played-age-50-220526309.html|title=Manute Bol's birthday was allegedly made up, and he might've played at age 50|author=|date=|website=sports.yahoo.com|accessdate=7 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"cbssports.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/ex-coach-says-he-made-up-manute-bols-birthday-he-couldve-been-40-or-50-in-nba/|title=Ex-coach says he made up Manute Bol's birthday: He could've been '40 or 50' in NBA|author=|date=|website=CBSSports.com|accessdate=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nBol came from a family of extraordinarily tall men and women. \"My mother was {{height|ft=6|in=10}}, my father {{height|ft=6|in=8}}, and my sister is {{height|ft=6|in=8}}\", he said. \"And my great-grandfather was even taller\u2014{{height|ft=7|in=10}}.\" His ethnic group, the Dinka, and the [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic people]]<ref>{{cite journal |last = Roberts |first = D.

Feeley eventually convinced Bol to go to the United States and play basketball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/manute-bol|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://plus2clothing.com/happened-manute-bol/|title=What Happened to Manute Bol|first=Steve|last=Rogers|date=7 April 2016|website=Plus 2 Clothing}}</ref>\n\nWith Feeley's input, Bol first landed in [[Cleveland]]. According to [[Cleveland State University]] basketball coach [[Kevin Mackey]], Bol could not provide a record of his birth date. Mackey listed it as October 16, 1962 on Cleveland State documents, but believed Bol was actually much older.<ref name=\"NYDN birthday\"/><ref name=\"Y birthday\"/><ref name=\"cbssports.com\"/> Bol did not speak or write English at the time of his arrival in Cleveland. He improved his English skills after months of classes at [[ELS Language Centers]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]], but not enough to qualify for enrollment at Cleveland State. Bol never played a game for Cleveland State. (Five years later, Cleveland State was placed on two years' probation for providing improper financial assistance to Bol and two other African players.)<ref>{{cite news |last = Associated Press |title = Penalties Upheld for Cleveland State |newspaper = The New York Times |pages = |date = Apr 22, 1988 |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9173AF931A15757C0A96E948260 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1985-02-20-8501060790-story.html|title=THE KING DINKA DUNKER: 7\u20136 HERDSMAN TO NBA?|first=Mitch Albom|last=Columnist|website=Sun-Sentinel.com}}</ref>\n\nAgain with Feeley's influence, Bol declared his intention to play professionally in the NBA. The [[Los Angeles Clippers]] drafted him in the fifth round of the [[1983 NBA draft]] (97th overall). Clippers Coach [[Jim Lynam]] received a call about Bol from Feeley, whom he knew from coaching circles. \"So, I said, 'Have you told anyone else about this?'\", Lynam recalled. \"Feeley said the only one in the NBA he had called was Frank Layden at Utah. He said Frank said he couldn't take another big guy like this. He already had Mark Eaton. I was the second guy Feeley had called. I told him he didn't have to call anyone else.\"<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1990/12/17/123285/a-tall-story-manute-bol-the-sixers-7-ft7-in-center-views-life-from-a-unique-perspective|title=A TALL STORY|first=Leigh|last=Montville|website=Vault}}</ref>\n\nAfter the June 1983 draft, Lynam traveled to Cleveland and watched Bol play pickup games. In speaking with Bol, through a fellow Sudanese player, Lynam learned that he had become hesitant about playing professionally because he did not know the language well enough to understand coaches.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Lynam said, \"One of the things everyone was looking at was his passport. His passport said he was 19 years old. His passport also said he was five feet two.\" When Lynam asked Bol about the discrepancy between his real height and his passport height, Bol said he had been sitting down when measured by Sudan officials.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nLanguage and passport concerns were set aside when the NBA ruled that Bol had not been eligible for the draft and declared the pick invalid. Bol had not declared 45 days before the draft as required.<ref name=\"USAToday\">{{cite news|title=Scouts: Bol has slim chance at success|date=April 12, 1985|first=Kathy|last=Blumenstock|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=}}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the NCAA questioning his eligibility for [[NCAA Division I]] basketball, Bol enrolled at the [[University of Bridgeport]], an [[NCAA Division II]] school with an English program for foreign students. There he played for the Purple Knights in the 1984\u201385 season. His coach was [[Bruce Webster]], a friend of Feeley. Bol averaged 22.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.1 blocks per game for Bridgeport. The team, which previously drew 500\u2013600 spectators, routinely sold out the 1,800-seat gym.<ref name=\"USAToday\"/> With Bol, Bridgeport qualified for the [[1985 NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament]].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Professional basketball career==\n\nBol turned professional in May 1985, signing with the [[Rhode Island Gulls]] of the spring [[United States Basketball League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/17/sports/sports-people-bol-may-turn-pro.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE; Bol May Turn Pro|date=17 May 1985|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-07/sports/sp-9482_1_gulls|title=Unusual Gulls Are Favorite in This Town|first=Associated|last=Press|date=7 July 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1985/06/24/628058/a-taste-of-high-society|title=A Taste Of High Society|first=Bruce|last=Newman|website=Vault}}</ref> Going into the [[1985 NBA draft]], scouts believed that Bol needed another year or two of college, but Bol opted for the draft because he felt it was the only way to earn enough money to get his sister out of Sudan, which was in a state of political unrest at the time.<ref name=\"USAToday\"/> In 1985, the Washington Bullets drafted Bol as the seventh pick in the second round (31st overall).<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/> He played in the NBA for ten seasons, from 1985 to 1995, spending parts of four seasons with the Bullets, parts of three with the [[Golden State Warriors]], parts of four with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and part of one with the [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===Washington Bullets (1985\u20131988) ===\nBol's first tenure with the Bullets lasted three seasons, from 1985 to 1988.

It is headquartered in [[Stockholm]] and its stock is traded on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] and on the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]].\n\n==History==\nTelia Company in its current form was first established as TeliaSonera, as the result of a 2002 [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] between the Swedish and Finnish telecommunications companies, '''Telia''' and '''Sonera'''. This merger followed shortly after Telia's failed merger attempt with [[Norway|Norwegian]] telecommunications company [[Telenor]], now its chief competitor in the Nordic countries.\n\nBefore [[privatisation]], Telia was a state telephone [[monopoly]]. Sonera, on the other hand, had a monopoly only on [[Trunking|trunk network]] calls, while most (c. 75%) of local telecommunication was provided by [[utility cooperative|telephone cooperative]]s. The separate brand names Telia and Sonera have continued to be used in the Swedish and Finnish markets respectively. Of the [[share (finance)|stock]], 37.3% is owned by the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]], and the rest by institutions, companies, and private investors worldwide. The [[Government of Finland|Finnish government]] (through [[Solidium]]) had 3.2% of shares, but disposed them in February 2018.\n\n===Telia===\n{{See also|Televerket (Sweden)}}\nThe Swedish '''Kungl. Telegrafverket''' (literally: ''Royal Telegraph Agency'') was founded in 1853, when the first electric [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] line was established between Stockholm and [[Uppsala]]. [[Allm\u00e4nna Telefon]] found an equipment supplier in Lars Magnus [[Ericsson]]. In this early competition, Telegrafverket with its brand '''Rikstelefon''' was a latecomer. However, by securing a national monopoly on [[long-distance operator|long-distance telephone]] lines, it was able with time to control and take over the local networks of quickly growing private telephone companies.\n\nA [[de facto]] telephone monopoly position was reached around 1920, and never needed legal sanction. In 1953 the name was modernised to '''Televerket.''' On 1 July 1992 this huge government agency's regulating functions was split off into the [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority]] ({{lang-sv|Post- och telestyrelsen}}, PTS), with similar functions as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] of the United States. The operation of the state radio and TV broadcast network was spun off into a company named [[Teracom]]. On 1 July 1993 the remaining telephone and mobile network operator was transformed into a government-owned shareholding company, named '''Telia AB.''' At the height of the [[dot-com bubble]], on 13 June 2000, close to one-third of Telia's shares were introduced on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Televerket was a pioneering mobile network operator with the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]] system, followed in the 1990s by [[GSM]]. Private competition in analogue mobile phone systems had already broken the telephone monopoly, and the growing [[internet]] allowed more opportunities for competitors. The most important of Telia's Swedish competitors in these areas has been [[Tele2]]. When PTS awarded four licenses for the [[3G|3rd generation]] mobile networks in December 2000, Telia was not among the winners, but later established an agreement to build a 3G network jointly with Tele2 using Tele2's licence. [[SUNAB]] was founded as the jointly owned company that would in turn build, own and operate the joint 3G network. In December 2018, Telia in cooperation with [[Ericsson]] launched Sweden's first 5G network at [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref>KP Krishna, Previewtech. \"[https://previewtech.net/5g-launch-verizon-sweden-south-korea-2342/ Telia and Ericsson launch 5G Network in Sweden KTH Campus].\" December 05, 2018. Retrieved December 06, 2018.</ref>\n\n===Sonera===\nThe history of [[Sonera]] dates back to 1917, when [[Suomen Lenn\u00e4tinlaitos]] (Finnish Telegraph Agency) was founded. In 1927, the telegraph agency was merged with the Finnish Post to form a new agency, Post and Telegraph Agency. This agency governed all long distance and international calls until 1994, when competitors were allowed to enter the Finnish market. In the same year, the Post and Telegraph Agency was divided to form two companies, [[Suomen Posti Oy]] (Finnish Post), and [[Telecom Finland Oy]]. Telecom Finland then changed its name to Sonera in 1998.\n\n===After merger===\nDuring the run up to the [[2006 Swedish general election|2006 general election]] the Swedish liberal-conservative [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]] stated as one of its policy aims to reduce government ownership in commercial entities, and specifically to sell its stake in TeliaSonera. The Alliance went on to win the election and formed a [[coalition government]]. The sale of TeliaSonera was however presented to the parliament only after the next [[2010 Swedish general election|election in 2010]], when the Alliance lost its majority but stayed on as a minority administration.\n\nOn 16 March 2011 the Alliance administration lost a parliamentary vote on sale of publicly owned commercial entities, including TeliaSonera, when a coalition of all opposition parties - the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] and [[Sweden Democrats]] - united against the Alliance.<ref>[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=4405131 F\u00f6rs\u00e4ljning av statliga bolag stoppas] Sveriges Radio, 16 March 2011</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of 2008,

No Ncell' to boycott services of Ncell in Nepal.\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL LIST -->\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n* [[List of Finnish companies]]\n* [[List of Swedish companies]]\n* [[Skanova]]\n* [[Telia Carrier]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{official website|http://www.teliasonera.com/}}\n* [http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/44/44746.html Yahoo! - TeliaSonera AB Company Profile]\n* [http://cdn.teliasonera.com TeliaSonera CDN]\n\n{{TeliaSonera}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Finnishmobileoperators}}\n{{OMX Helsinki 25 companies}}\n{{OMX Stockholm 30 companies}}\n{{CATV}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 2003]]\n[[Category:2003 establishments in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications monopolies]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Partly privatized companies of Finland]]\n[[Category:Partly privatized companies of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2003]]\n[[Category:Companies formed by merger]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Telia Company AB\n| logo = Telia Company logo.svg\n| logo_size = 250px\n| image = Mall of Scandinavia 2016.jpg\n| type = [[Public company|Publicly traded]] [[Aktiebolag]]\n| traded_as = {{OMX|SSE5095|TELIA}}<br />{{OMX|HEX24381|TELIA1}}\n| foundation = {{start date and age|df=yes|2003}}\n| location = [[Solna]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]\n| area_served = Europe, Asia\n| key_people = [[Johan Dennelind]] <small>(President and [[chief executive officer|CEO]])</small>, [[Marie Ehrling]] <small>([[Chairman]])</small>\n| industry = [[Telecommunication]]s\n| products = [[Tier 1 network|Tier-1 network provider]], [[mobile network operator]], [[Internet access|Internet service Provider]] , [[Landline|Fixed-line communications]], [[IT hosting]]\n| revenue = [[EUR|\u20ac]]9.7 billion <small>(2014)</small><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=101000000000&From=SEK&To=EUR|title=XE: Convert SEK/EUR.

It is headquartered in [[Stockholm]] and its stock is traded on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] and on the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]].\n\n==History==\nTelia Company in its current form was first established as TeliaSonera, as the result of a 2002 [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] between the Swedish and Finnish telecommunications companies, '''Telia''' and '''Sonera'''. This merger followed shortly after Telia's failed merger attempt with [[Norway|Norwegian]] telecommunications company [[Telenor]], now its chief competitor in the Nordic countries.\n\nBefore [[privatisation]], Telia was a state telephone [[monopoly]]. Sonera, on the other hand, had a monopoly only on [[Trunking|trunk network]] calls, while most (c. 75%) of local telecommunication was provided by [[utility cooperative|telephone cooperative]]s. The separate brand names Telia and Sonera have continued to be used in the Swedish and Finnish markets respectively. Of the [[share (finance)|stock]], 37.3% is owned by the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]], and the rest by institutions, companies, and private investors worldwide. The [[Government of Finland|Finnish government]] (through [[Solidium]]) had 3.2% of shares, but disposed them in February 2018.\n\n===Telia===\n{{See also|Televerket (Sweden)}}\nThe Swedish '''Kungl. Telegrafverket''' (literally: ''Royal Telegraph Agency'') was founded in 1853, when the first electric [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] line was established between Stockholm and [[Uppsala]]. [[Allm\u00e4nna Telefon]] found an equipment supplier in Lars Magnus [[Ericsson]]. In this early competition, Telegrafverket with its brand '''Rikstelefon''' was a latecomer. However, by securing a national monopoly on [[long-distance operator|long distance telephone]] lines, it was able with time to control and take over the local networks of quickly growing private telephone companies.\n\nA [[de facto]] telephone monopoly position was reached around 1920, and never needed legal sanction. In 1953 the name was modernised to '''Televerket.''' On 1 July 1992 this huge government agency's regulating functions was split off into the [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority]] ({{lang-sv|Post- och telestyrelsen}}, PTS), with similar functions as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] of the United States. The operation of the state radio and TV broadcast network was spun off into a company named [[Teracom]]. On 1 July 1993 the remaining telephone and mobile network operator was transformed into a government-owned shareholding company, named '''Telia AB.''' At the height of the [[dot-com bubble]], on 13 June 2000, close to one-third of Telia's shares were introduced on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Televerket was a pioneering mobile network operator with the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]] system, followed in the 1990s by [[GSM]]. Private competition in analogue mobile phone systems had already broken the telephone monopoly, and the growing [[internet]] allowed more opportunities for competitors. The most important of Telia's Swedish competitors in these areas has been [[Tele2]]. When PTS awarded four licenses for the [[3G|3rd generation]] mobile networks in December 2000, Telia was not among the winners, but later established an agreement to build a 3G network jointly with Tele2 using Tele2's licence. [[SUNAB]] was founded as the jointly owned company that would in turn build, own and operate the joint 3G network. In December 2018, Telia in cooperation with [[Ericsson]] launched Sweden's first 5G network at [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref>KP Krishna, Previewtech. \"[https://previewtech.net/5g-launch-verizon-sweden-south-korea-2342/ Telia and Ericsson launch 5G Network in Sweden KTH Campus].\" December 05, 2018. Retrieved December 06, 2018.</ref>\n\n===Sonera===\nThe history of [[Sonera]] dates back to 1917, when [[Suomen Lenn\u00e4tinlaitos]] (Finnish Telegraph Agency) was founded. In 1927, the telegraph agency was merged with the Finnish Post to form a new agency, Post and Telegraph Agency. This agency governed all long distance and international calls until 1994, when competitors were allowed to enter the Finnish market. In the same year, the Post and Telegraph Agency was divided to form two companies, [[Suomen Posti Oy]] (Finnish Post), and [[Telecom Finland Oy]]. Telecom Finland then changed its name to Sonera in 1998.\n\n===After merger===\nDuring the run up to the [[2006 Swedish general election|2006 general election]] the Swedish liberal-conservative [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]] stated as one of its policy aims to reduce government ownership in commercial entities, and specifically to sell its stake in TeliaSonera. The Alliance went on to win the election and formed a [[coalition government]]. The sale of TeliaSonera was however presented to the parliament only after the next [[2010 Swedish general election|election in 2010]], when the Alliance lost its majority but stayed on as a minority administration.\n\nOn 16 March 2011 the Alliance administration lost a parliamentary vote on sale of publicly owned commercial entities, including TeliaSonera, when a coalition of all opposition parties - the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] and [[Sweden Democrats]] - united against the Alliance.<ref>[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=4405131 F\u00f6rs\u00e4ljning av statliga bolag stoppas] Sveriges Radio, 16 March 2011</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of 2008,

Telia was the fourth operator to launch 3G services and is the only operator to have a nationwide [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE network]].\n\nTelia Broadband was relaunched in 2008 because of the need for TeliaSonera to offer both mobile and broadband in all of their home markets (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland).

Most federal law-enforcement agencies are under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]. The head of each agency is an IPS officer. The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing\u2014including the apprehension of criminals\u2014is done by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organization by authorizing the creation of the Indian Police Service.\n[[File:National Police Museum New Delhi India.jpg|alt=Museum exhibit, with uniformed mannequins|thumb|upright=1.2|Exhibit of the [[Railway Protection Force]], [[Rapid Action Force]], [[National Security Guard]], and [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] at the [[National Police Memorial (India)|National Police Memorial and Museum]] in [[New Delhi]].]]\nCentral police forces can assist a state's police force if requested by a state government. During the 1975-77 [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]], the constitution was amended on 1 February 1976 to permit the central government to deploy its armed police forces without state permission. The amendment was unpopular, and use of the central police forces was controversial. After the Emergency was lifted, the constitution was again amended in December 1978 to restore the status quo.\n\n===Ministry of Home Affairs===\nThe principal national ministry concerned with law enforcement is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which supervises a large number of government functions and agencies operated and administered by the central government. The ministry is concerned with matters pertaining to the maintenance of public peace and order, the staffing and administration of the public services, delineation of internal boundaries, and the administration of [[Union territory|union territories]].\n\nIn addition to controlling the IPS, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains several agencies and organizations dealing with police and security. Police in the union territories are under the MHA. The [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] is the cabinet minister responsible for the ministry; the [[Home Secretary of India|Home Secretary]], an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer, is the ministry's administrative head.\n\n===Central Armed Police Forces===\n{{Main|Central Armed Police Forces}}\n====Border Security Force====\nThe [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) is responsible for policing India's land borders in peacetime and preventing trans-border crimes. A central police force under the Ministry of Home Affairs, its duties include VIP security, election supervision, guarding vital installations and [[Naxalite|counter-naxal]] operations.\n\nThe [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], which highlighted the inadequacy of the existing border-management system, led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central armed police force mandated with guarding India's boundary with [[Pakistan]]. The BSF's policing capability was used in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], against the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]], in areas which were the least threatened. During wartime or when ordered by the central government, the BSF is commanded by the [[Indian Army]]; BSF troops participated in the 1971 [[Battle of Longewala]] in this capacity. After the 1971 war (which led to the creation of [[Bangladesh]]), responsibility for policing the border with Bangladesh was assigned to the force.\n[[File:Indian BSF Soldier.jpg|alt=Two women conducting a ceremonial border retreat|thumb|Indian Border Security Officer in ceremonial uniform.]]\nOriginally charged with guarding India's external borders, the BSF has been tasked with [[counter-insurgency]] and [[counter-terrorism]] operations. When [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]] broke out in 1989 and the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state police and the thinly-deployed [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF) needed extra force to cope with spiraling violence, the central government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat [[Islamic terrorism|Kashmiri militants]].\n\nBSF operates a Tear-Smoke Unit at its [[Police academy|academy]] in [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], which supplies [[tear gas]] and [[Shell (projectile)#Smoke|smoke shells]] for riot prevention to all [[State police#India|state police]] forces. It operates [[Police dog|dog squads]], and runs the National Dog Training and Research Centre. The BSF, one of several Indian police forces which have its own [[Wing (military aviation unit)|air]] and water wings, provides helicopter, dog and other support services to the state police.\n\n====Central Industrial Security Force====\nThe [[Central Industrial Security Force]]'s (CISF) primary task is to provide industrial security.{{cn|date=July 2019}} It guards industrial installations nationwide which are owned by the central government, secures [[seaport]]s and [[airport]]s, and provides security for certain [[non-governmental organization]]s. The CISF provides security for nuclear-power plants, space installations, mints, oil fields and refineries, heavy-engineering and steel plants, [[Barrage (dam)|barrages]], fertilizer units, hydroelectric and [[thermal power station]]s, and other installations partially (or wholly) run by the government.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Central Reserve Police Force====\nThe [[Central Reserve Police Force|Central Reserve Police Force's]] (CRPF) main objective is to assist states and union territories' law-enforcement agencies in maintaining law and order and containing [[insurgency]]. It is deployed as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] unit in several regions, and operates abroad as part of [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Indo-Tibetan Border Police====\nThe 90,000-member [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP) is responsible for security along the {{convert|2115|km|adj=on}} Indo-[[Tibet]]an border and its surrounding areas. ITBP personnel are trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security.\n\n===={{anchor|National Security Guards}}National Security Guard====\nThe [[National Security Guard]] (NSG) is a [[commando]] unit originally created for counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue missions. Founded in 1986, it is popularly known as the \"Black Cats\" for its uniform. Like most military and elite-security units in India, it avoids the media and the Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details.\n\nThe NSG draws its core members from the Indian Army, and the balance is support staff from other central police units. An NSG team and a transport aircraft is stationed at [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] in New Delhi, ready to deploy in 30 minutes.\n\n===={{anchor|Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)}}Sashastra Seema Bal====\n[[Sashastra Seema Bal]] (SSB), founded in 1963, is deployed at the Indo-[[Nepal]] and Indo-[[Bhutan]] borders. SSB, with over 82,000 personnel, is trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security. Its personnel are also deployed to the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW), [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), National Security Guard. Officers begin as an [[assistant commandant]] (equivalent to deputy superintendent of police on a state force), and retire with the rank of [[Inspector general#India|inspector general]] (IG).\n\n===Special Protection Group===\nThe [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), the central government's [[executive protection]] agency, is responsible for the protection of the [[Prime Minister of India]] and their immediate family. The force was established in 1985, after the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]]. It provides [[24/7 service|daily, round-the-clock]] security throughout India to the present Prime Minister and his family.\n\n===Central investigation and intelligence institutions===\n\n====Central Bureau of Investigation====\nThe [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) is India's premier investigative agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[criminal]] and [[national security]] matters. Often cited as established with the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, it was formed by the central government (which controls the Delhi police) with a resolution. Its constitutionality was questioned in the [[Gauhati High Court]] ''Narendra Kumar vs Union of India'' case on the basis that all areas of policing are exclusive to state governments, and the CBI is a central-government agency. The court ruled that despite the lack of legislation, the CBI is an authorized agency of the central government for national policing. Its ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of India]], which cited the CBI's national importance.\n\nThe bureau is controlled by the Department of Personnel and Training in the [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]] of the [[government of India]], usually headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] as the [[Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]]. India's [[Interpol]] unit, the CBI draws its personnel from IPS officers throughout the country. Specializing in crimes involving high-ranking government officials and politicians, the CBI has also accepted other criminal because of media and public pressure (usually due to local-police investigative incompetence).\n\n===={{anchor|Indian Income-tax Department}}Income Tax Department====\n{{Main|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation|Investigation Division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes|Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Central}}\n[[File:ALH Dhruv, Indian Air Force.jpg|alt=Indian Navy helicopter, seen from below|thumb|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation helicopters are supplied by the Indian Air Force.]]\nThe [[Income Tax Department]] (ITD) is India's premier financial agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[financial]] and [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] matters.

Each state and union territory has a state police force (headed by a [[director general of police]], an Indian Police Service officer), which is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state's townships and rural areas.\n\n[[West Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]] have taken steps to train their police forces by advanced police-training schools such as [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Atlanta Police Department]] and the World Police Academy in [[Canada]]. The [[Tamil Nadu Police]] Academy is seeking university status, and the [[Kerala Police]] is South Asia's first police force to adopt [[community policing]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Police Act of 1861 established the principles of organization for police forces in India and, with minor modifications, continues in effect. Although state police forces are separate and may differ in quality of equipment and resources, their patterns of organization and operation are similar.\n\nThe director (or inspector general) of police reports to the head of the home department of the state, generally an Indian Administrative Service officer at the rank of additional chief secretary or principal secretary to the state government. Under the inspector general are police ranges composed of three to six districts, headed by deputy inspectors general. District police headquarters are commanded by [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendents of police]] (SP), who have discretionary powers and oversee subordinate police stations, criminal-investigation detachments, equipment storehouses and armories, and traffic police.\n\nMost preventive police work is carried out by constables assigned to police stations. Depending on the number of stations, a district may be subdivided and further divided into police circles to facilitate supervision by district headquarters. Most major metropolitan areas, such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, have police commissionerates under the state police and headed by commissioners. Police in the states and [[Union territory|union territories]] are assisted by units of volunteer [[Home Guard (India)|Home Guards]] under guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nIn most states and territories, police forces are divided into civil (unarmed) police and armed contingents. Civil police staff police stations, conduct investigations, answer routine complaints, perform traffic duties, and patrol the streets. They usually carry [[Fighting stick|lathis]]: bamboo staffs, weighted (or tipped) with iron.\n[[File:Karnataka Police Tata Vehicle.JPG|alt=Two motorcycle police officers in front of a police car|thumb|Armed SWAT vehicle of the Karnataka Police]]\nArmed police are divided into two groups: district armed police and the [[Provincial Armed Constabulary]] (Pradeshik). District armed police are organized like an army infantry battalion. Assigned to police stations, they perform guard and escort duties. States which maintain armed contingents use them as an emergency reserve strike force. The units are organized as a mobile armed force under state control or, in the case of district armed police (who are not as well equipped), as a force directed by district superintendents and generally used for riot control.\n\nThe Provincial Armed Constabulary is an armed reserve maintained at key locations in some states and activated on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities. Armed constabulary are not usually in contact with the public unless they are assigned to VIP duty or maintaining order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They may be sent to quell outbreaks of student or labour unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts, and to participate in anti-terrorism operations. Depending on the assignment, the Provincial Armed Constabulary may only carry lathis.\n\nSenior police officers answer to the police [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and respond to the general direction of designated civilian officials. In the municipal force, the chain of command runs to the state home secretary rather than the district superintendent or district officials.\n\nWorking conditions and pay are poor, especially in the lower echelons.

Female officers were first used in 1972, and a number of women hold key positions in state police organizations. Their absolute numbers, however, are small. Uniformed and undercover women police officers have been deployed in New Delhi as the Anti-Eve Teasing Squad, which combats the [[sexual harassment]] of women (\"Eves\"). Several women-only police stations have been established in Tamil Nadu to handle sex crimes against women. \n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:Ranks of Police National Police Museum New Delhi India.jpg|thumb|alt=Mannequins in khaki uniforms|Exhibit of Indian police ranks and uniforms at the [[National Police Memorial (India)|National Police Memorial and Museum]], New Delhi]]\nUniforms of state and local police vary by grade, region, and type of duty. The main service uniform for state police is khaki. Some cities, such as [[Kolkata]], have white uniforms.

Other DG rank officers head autonomous bodies not controlled by the DGP, such as the police recruitment board, fire service and police training. State forces are organised into zones, which consist of two (or more) ranges. Important zones are headed by an additional director general of police, and other zones are headed by an [[Inspector-general of police#India|inspector-general of police]] (IG). Ranges consist of several districts. Important ranges are headed by an IG, and other ranges are headed by a DIG.\n\nImportant districts are headed by a senior [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]] (SSP), and other districts are headed by a superintendent of police (SP). If an SSP is heading the district, they are assisted by two (or more) SPs. If an SP is heading the district, they are generally assisted by one or two) SPs. Each district is divided into sub-divisions or circles, under a [[deputy superintendent of police]] (DSP). Each sub-division consists of several police stations commanded by an [[Inspector|inspector of police]], who is assisted by [[sub-inspector]]s (SIs) and [[Assistant sub-inspector of police|assistant sub-inspectors]] (ASIs). In rural areas, a sub-inspector is in charge of a police station; sub-inspectors (and higher) can file a charge sheet in court.\n\nDistrict SPs are not empowered as executive magistrates. The [[District magistrate (India)|district magistrate]] (DM, an IAS officer) exercises these powers, which include promulgating Section 144 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (India)|Code of Criminal Procedure]] (CrPC) and issuing arms licenses.\n\n==={{anchor|Criminal Investigation Department}}Criminal investigation department===\nA [[Criminal investigation department#India|criminal investigation department]] (CID) is constituted in each district under a deputy inspector general to collect and distribute information about organized crime.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Police commissionerates===\n[[File:India - Kolkata traffic cop - 3661.jpg|alt=Two mounted-police officers|thumb|Traffic Police directing cars in Kolkata.]]\nSome cities use the police commissionerate system (like [[Kolkata Police Force|Kolkata]], [[Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate]], [[Mumbai Police|Mumbai]], [[Delhi Police|Delhi]] ,[[Pune Police|Pune]] etc.), headed by a [[Police commissioner#India|police commissioner]].Demand for this system is increasing as it gives police a free hand to act freely and take control of any situation.71 large cities and suburban areas currently have this system.Even in British Raj, the presidency towns of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Chennai|Madras]] had commissionerate system.Reporting to the Police Commissioner(CP) are the Joint Police Commissioner(Joint CPs), Deputy Commissioner of Police(DCPs) and Assistant Commissioner of Police(ACPs).Commissioners of police and their deputies are empowered as executive magistrates to enforce [[Unlawful assembly#India|Section 144 of the CrPC]] and issue arms licenses. Police commissionerates are subordinate to the state police except for the [[Kolkata Police Force]], which independently reports to the [[Department of Home (West Bengal)|Department of Home]] of [[Government of West Bengal]].\n\n===Traffic police===\nHighway and traffic police in small towns are under the state police; traffic police in cities are under the metropolitan and state police. Traffic police maintain a smooth traffic flow and stop offenders. Highway police secure the highways and catch speeders. Accidents, registrations, and vehicle data are checked by traffic police.\n\n==={{anchor|State armed police forces}}State Armed Police Forces===\nThe [[State Armed Police Forces]] provide a state with policing in particularly violent or serious situations, such as combating [[banditry]] and [[Naxalite]]s. Like the [[Central Armed Police Forces]], they are known unofficially as paramilitary forces. Each state police force maintains an armed force, with names such as Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and Special Armed Police, which is responsible for emergencies and crowd control. They are generally activated on orders from a [[Deputy inspector general of police#India|deputy inspector general]] or higher-level authorities.

Educational requirements increase for higher posts.\n\nAssistant superintendents of police (ASP) are recruited annually by the independent [[Union Public Service Commission]] by competitive examination, and are appointed to the Indian Police Service. The IPS officers are then assigned to a state force. Trainee officers undergo 44 weeks of initial training, which includes invited lawyers and management consultants. At the end of their probation, they have several weeks of orientation at the state police academy.\n\nNon-managerial positions are selected by the state (or central) government, and are trained at police recruit schools. The length of training for inspectors is about a year; for constables, it is nearly nine months. School training staff is drawn from the police force. Police are trained in basic law, self-protection, weapons handling and other skills at recruit stations. Superior recruits receive special training.\n\nRecruitment for state police is conducted by state police recruitment boards. Eligibility standards are set by the central government, depending on state demographics.\n\n==Transport==\n{|| class=\"wikitable\" \n! Vehicle\n! Origin\n! Use\n!

The [[Mahindra Legend]] Jeep had been the most common police car in India;  other SUVs, such as the [[Maruti Gypsy]], [[Mahindra Bolero]], [[Tata Sumo]], [[Tata Safari]], [[Chevrolet Tavera]] and [[Toyota Qualis]], are now used. SUVs are known for their capability in varied terrain.\n\n[[Minivan]]s are used by police in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, where the Chevrolet Tavera ([[Delhi]], [[Kochi]], [[Kozhikode]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]]), Toyota Qualis ([[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]] and [[Chennai]]) and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga ([[Bangalore]] and Pune) are extensively used. Although most cities use SUVs and minivans, Chennai has adopted [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] such as the [[Hyundai Accent]]; [[Kolkata]] has adopted the [[Tata Indigo]]. In [[Kerala]] cities such as [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kochi]] and [[Kozhikode]], the Pink Patrol (to protect women) uses the [[Toyota Etios]]. \n\nDepending upon the state, police vehicles may have revolving lights, strobes or light bars. A modernisation drive has ensured that vehicles are equipped with [[two-way radio]]s in communication with a central control room. Highway police vehicles generally have [[Speed limit enforcement|radar equipment]], [[Breathalyzer|breath analysers]] and emergency [[first aid kit]]s. For traffic regulation and city patrol, [[motorcycle]]s are also used; most were the Indian version of the [[Royal Enfield Bullet]], but the [[Bajaj Pulsar]] and [[TVS Apache]] are also used.\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\nWeapons and equipment vary from state to state and agency to agency. Standard equipment for a [[constable]] on the [[Beat (police)|beat]] is the lathi, or baton\u2014generally made of [[bamboo]], but currently also made of [[polymer]]. Riot police have other equipment, including [[tear gas]] and [[taser]]s.\n\nAlthough police constables do not generally carry firearms on regular duty, they are available at police stations. Officers at and above the rank of [[sub-inspector]] or head constable are authorized to carry a [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]], generally a [[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]] or a [[Glock 17]]. Officers always carry side arms. Traffic police officers have fine books and other equipment.\n\nFirearms previously stocked at police stations included [[Lee\u2013Enfield|.303 Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles (now replaced), [[FN FAL|7.62 1A]] self-loading rifles and [[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1s]], which have been replaced by [[AK-47]] and [[INSAS rifle]]s. The [[Ordnance Factory Board]] is a supplier of arms, ammunition, uniforms, bullet-proof vehicles, and mine-protected vehicles to the police. Only a station officer can allow the use of reserve guns in emergencies. During public unrest, protests or possible terrorist attacks, police are equipped by the state (or central) government.\n\nSpecial units at the state and federal level have automatic weapons, such as the AK-47, [[AKM]] and INSAS [[assault rifle]]s and [[Bren light machine gun|Bren guns]]. Special-forces and [[SWAT]] units use [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]s, [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9]]s, [[AK-103]]s, [[M4 carbine|M4A1 Carbine]]s and others.

Most federal law-enforcement agencies are under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]. The head of each agency is an IPS officer. The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing\u2014including the apprehension of criminals\u2014is done by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organization by authorizing the creation of the Indian Police Service.\n[[File:National Police Museum New Delhi India.jpg|alt=Museum exhibit, with uniformed mannequins|thumb|upright=1.2|Exhibit of the [[Railway Protection Force]], [[Rapid Action Force]], [[National Security Guard]], and [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] at the [[National Police Memorial (India)|National Police Memorial and Museum]] in [[New Delhi]].]]\nCentral police forces can assist a state's police force if requested by a state government. During the 1975-77 [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]], the constitution was amended on 1 February 1976 to permit the central government to deploy its armed police forces without state permission. The amendment was unpopular, and use of the central police forces was controversial. After the Emergency was lifted, the constitution was again amended in December 1978 to restore the status quo.\n\n===Ministry of Home Affairs===\nThe principal national ministry concerned with law enforcement is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which supervises a large number of government functions and agencies operated and administered by the central government. The ministry is concerned with matters pertaining to the maintenance of public peace and order, the staffing and administration of the public services, delineation of internal boundaries, and the administration of [[Union territory|union territories]].\n\nIn addition to controlling the IPS, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains several agencies and organizations dealing with police and security. Police in the union territories are under the MHA. The [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] is the cabinet minister responsible for the ministry; the [[Home Secretary of India|Home Secretary]], an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer, is the ministry's administrative head.\n\n===Central Armed Police Forces===\n{{Main|Central Armed Police Forces}}\n====Border Security Force====\nThe [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) is responsible for policing India's land borders in peacetime and preventing trans-border crimes. A central police force under the Ministry of Home Affairs, its duties include VIP security, election supervision, guarding vital installations and [[Naxalite|counter-naxal]] operations.\n\nThe [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], which highlighted the inadequacy of the existing border-management system, led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central armed police force mandated with guarding India's boundary with [[Pakistan]]. The BSF's policing capability was used in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], against the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]], in areas which were the least threatened. During wartime or when ordered by the central government, the BSF is commanded by the [[Indian Army]]; BSF troops participated in the 1971 [[Battle of Longewala]] in this capacity. After the 1971 war (which led to the creation of [[Bangladesh]]), responsibility for policing the border with Bangladesh was assigned to the force.\n[[File:Indian BSF Soldier.jpg|alt=Two women conducting a ceremonial border retreat|thumb|Indian Border Security Officer in ceremonial uniform.]]\nOriginally charged with guarding India's external borders, the BSF has been tasked with [[counter-insurgency]] and [[counter-terrorism]] operations. When [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]] broke out in 1989 and the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state police and the thinly-deployed [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF) needed extra force to cope with spiraling violence, the central government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat [[Islamic terrorism|Kashmiri militants]].\n\nBSF operates a Tear-Smoke Unit at its [[Police academy|academy]] in [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], which supplies [[tear gas]] and [[Shell (projectile)#Smoke|smoke shells]] for riot prevention to all [[State police#India|state police]] forces. It operates [[Police dog|dog squads]], and runs the National Dog Training and Research Centre. The BSF, one of several Indian police forces which have its own [[Wing (military aviation unit)|air]] and water wings, provides helicopter, dog and other support services to the state police.\n\n====Central Industrial Security Force====\nThe [[Central Industrial Security Force]]'s (CISF) primary task is to provide industrial security.{{cn|date=July 2019}} It guards industrial installations nationwide which are owned by the central government, secures [[seaport]]s and [[airport]]s, and provides security for certain [[non-governmental organization]]s. The CISF provides security for nuclear-power plants, space installations, mints, oil fields and refineries, heavy-engineering and steel plants, [[Barrage (dam)|barrages]], fertilizer units, hydroelectric and [[thermal power station]]s, and other installations partially (or wholly) run by the government.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Central Reserve Police Force====\nThe [[Central Reserve Police Force|Central Reserve Police Force's]] (CRPF) main objective is to assist states and union territories' law-enforcement agencies in maintaining law and order and containing [[insurgency]]. It is deployed as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] unit in several regions, and operates abroad as part of [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Indo-Tibetan Border Police====\nThe 90,000-member [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP) is responsible for security along the {{convert|2115|km|adj=on}} Indo-[[Tibet]]an border and its surrounding areas. ITBP personnel are trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security.\n\n===={{anchor|National Security Guards}}National Security Guard====\nThe [[National Security Guard]] (NSG) is a [[commando]] unit originally created for counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue missions. Founded in 1986, it is popularly known as the \"Black Cats\" for its uniform. Like most military and elite-security units in India, it avoids the media and the Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details.\n\nThe NSG draws its core members from the Indian Army, and the balance is support staff from other central police units. An NSG team and a transport aircraft is stationed at [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] in New Delhi, ready to deploy in 30 minutes.\n\n===={{anchor|Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)}}Sashastra Seema Bal====\n[[Sashastra Seema Bal]] (SSB), founded in 1963, is deployed at the Indo-[[Nepal]] and Indo-[[Bhutan]] borders. SSB, with over 82,000 personnel, is trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security. Its personnel are also deployed to the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW), [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), National Security Guard. Officers begin as an [[assistant commandant]] (equivalent to deputy superintendent of police on a state force), and retire with the rank of [[Inspector general#India|inspector general]] (IG).\n\n===Special Protection Group===\nThe [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), the central government's [[executive protection]] agency, is responsible for the protection of the [[Prime Minister of India]] and their immediate family. The force was established in 1985, after the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]]. It provides [[24/7 service|daily, round-the-clock]] security throughout India to the present Prime Minister and his family.\n\n===Central investigation and intelligence institutions===\n\n====Central Bureau of Investigation====\nThe [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) is India's premier investigative agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[criminal]] and [[national security]] matters. Often cited as established with the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, it was formed by the central government (which controls the Delhi police) with a resolution. Its constitutionality was questioned in the [[Gauhati High Court]] ''Narendra Kumar vs Union of India'' case on the basis that all areas of policing are exclusive to state governments, and the CBI is a central-government agency. The court ruled that despite the lack of legislation, the CBI is an authorized agency of the central government for national policing. Its ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of India]], which cited the CBI's national importance.\n\nThe bureau is controlled by the Department of Personnel and Training in the [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]] of the [[government of India]], usually headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] as the [[Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]]. India's [[Interpol]] unit, the CBI draws its personnel from IPS officers throughout the country. Specializing in crimes involving high-ranking government officials and politicians, the CBI has also accepted other criminal because of media and public pressure (usually due to local-police investigative incompetence).\n\n===={{anchor|Indian Income-tax Department}}Income Tax Department====\n{{Main|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation|Investigation Division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes|Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Central}}\n[[File:ALH Dhruv, Indian Air Force.jpg|alt=Indian Navy helicopter, seen from below|thumb|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation helicopters are supplied by the Indian Air Force.]]\nThe [[Income Tax Department]] (ITD) is India's premier financial agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[financial]] and [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] matters. The department is controlled by the Department of Revenue in the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], headed by a [[Union Council of Ministers|minister]] who reports directly to the prime minister. The [[Taxation in India|Central Board of Direct Taxes]] (CBDT) is also part of the Department of Revenue. It provides input for policy and planning of [[Direct tax#Direct taxation in India|direct taxes]], and is responsible for the administration of direct-tax laws through the Income Tax Department. The CBDT operates in accordance with the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. The board members, in their ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' capacity, are also a division of the ministry dealing with matters relating to the levy and collection of taxes, tax evasion and revenue intelligence. It is India's official [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) unit.

In September 1979, the institute became a department of the Ministry of Home Affairs with a full-time director. It is headed by senior [[Indian Police Service]] officers. The institute trains in [[cybercrime]] investigations, and researches aspects of criminology and forensics (including cyberforensics). It is listed as a science and technology organization by the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]].\n\n==State police==\n{{main|State_police#India|l1=List of state police forces of India}}\n[[File:City of Taj Police Car.jpg|alt=A smiling constable|thumb|Agra Police Patrol Car]]\nAuthority over a state police force is held by the state's home department, led by a [[Chief secretary (India)|chief]] or [[Principal Secretary (India)|principal secretary]] (generally an [[Indian Administrative Service]] officer). Each state and union territory has a state police force (headed by a [[director general of police]], an Indian Police Service officer), which is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state's townships and rural areas.\n\n[[West Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]] have taken steps to train their police forces by advanced police-training schools such as [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Atlanta Police Department]] and the World Police Academy in [[Canada]]. The [[Tamil Nadu Police]] Academy is seeking university status, and the [[Kerala Police]] is South Asia's first police force to adopt [[community policing]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Police Act of 1861 established the principles of organization for police forces in India and, with minor modifications, continues in effect. Although state police forces are separate and may differ in quality of equipment and resources, their patterns of organization and operation are similar.\n\nThe director (or inspector general) of police reports to the head of the home department of the state, generally an Indian Administrative Service officer at the rank of additional chief secretary or principal secretary to the state government. Under the inspector general are police ranges composed of three to six districts, headed by deputy inspectors general. District police headquarters are commanded by [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendents of police]] (SP), who have discretionary powers and oversee subordinate police stations, criminal-investigation detachments, equipment storehouses and armories, and traffic police.\n\nMost preventive police work is carried out by constables assigned to police stations. Depending on the number of stations, a district may be subdivided and further divided into police circles to facilitate supervision by district headquarters. Most major metropolitan areas, such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, have police commissionerates under the state police and headed by commissioners. Police in the states and [[Union territory|union territories]] are assisted by units of volunteer [[Home Guard (India)|Home Guards]] under guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nIn most states and territories, police forces are divided into civil (unarmed) police and armed contingents. Civil police staff police stations, conduct investigations, answer routine complaints, perform traffic duties, and patrol the streets. They usually carry [[Fighting stick|lathis]]: bamboo staffs, weighted (or tipped) with iron.\n[[File:Karnataka Police Tata Vehicle.JPG|alt=Two motorcycle police officers in front of a police car|thumb|Armed SWAT vehicle of the Karnataka Police]]\nArmed police are divided into two groups: district armed police and the [[Provincial Armed Constabulary]] (Pradeshik). District armed police are organized like an army infantry battalion. Assigned to police stations, they perform guard and escort duties. States which maintain armed contingents use them as an emergency reserve strike force. The units are organized as a mobile armed force under state control or, in the case of district armed police (who are not as well equipped), as a force directed by district superintendents and generally used for riot control.\n\nThe Provincial Armed Constabulary is an armed reserve maintained at key locations in some states and activated on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities. Armed constabulary are not usually in contact with the public unless they are assigned to VIP duty or maintaining order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They may be sent to quell outbreaks of student or labour unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts, and to participate in anti-terrorism operations. Depending on the assignment, the Provincial Armed Constabulary may only carry lathis.\n\nSenior police officers answer to the police [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and respond to the general direction of designated civilian officials. In the municipal force, the chain of command runs to the state home secretary rather than the district superintendent or district officials.\n\nWorking conditions and pay are poor, especially in the lower echelons. Recruits receive about {{INR}}9,000 per month (about US$150). Opportunities for promotion are limited because of the system of horizontal entry into higher grades.{{clarify|date=July 2019}} Allegations of bribery, attributable to low pay and poor working conditions, have been widespread.{{cn|date=July 2019}} A 2016 article on the Maharashtra state police describes why reform is needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/news/Fixing-Mumbai-Free-the-police/article14494203.ece|title=Fixing Mumbai: Free the police|first=Vappala|last=Balachandran|date=17 July 2016|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\nWomen have entered into the higher echelons of Indian police in greater numbers since the late 1980s, primarily through the Indian Police Service system. Female officers were first used in 1972, and a number of women hold key positions in state police organizations. Their absolute numbers, however, are small. Uniformed and undercover women police officers have been deployed in New Delhi as the Anti-Eve Teasing Squad, which combats the [[sexual harassment]] of women (\"Eves\").

The main service uniform for state police is khaki. Some cities, such as [[Kolkata]], have white uniforms. Headgear differs by rank and state; officers usually wear a [[peaked cap]], and constables wear [[beret]]s or [[sidecap]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://persmin.gov.in/Archive/Acts_Rules_Archive/AISRules_Archive/IPSRules/IPS(Uniform)Rules(Revised).htm#_ftnref21 |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208194152/http://persmin.gov.in/Archive/Acts_Rules_Archive/AISRules_Archive/IPSRules/IPS(Uniform)Rules(Revised).htm#_ftnref21 |archive-date=8 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Branches such as the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] do not have a uniform; business dress (shirt, tie, blazer, etc.) is worn with a badge. Special-service armed police have tactical uniforms in accordance with their function, and traffic police generally wear a white uniform.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Organisation===\n[[File:Delhi police headquarters.JPG|alt=A pensive-looking Pune police commissioner Meeran Borwankar|thumb|Delhi Police Headquarters]]\nThe state police is headed by an IPS officer with the rank of [[director general of police]] (DGP), assisted by two (or more) [[Additional director general of police|additional directors general of police]] (ADGs). Other DG rank officers head autonomous bodies not controlled by the DGP, such as the police recruitment board, fire service and police training. State forces are organised into zones, which consist of two (or more) ranges. Important zones are headed by an additional director general of police, and other zones are headed by an [[Inspector-general of police#India|inspector-general of police]] (IG). Ranges consist of several districts. Important ranges are headed by an IG, and other ranges are headed by a DIG.\n\nImportant districts are headed by a senior [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]] (SSP), and other districts are headed by a superintendent of police (SP). If an SSP is heading the district, they are assisted by two (or more) SPs. If an SP is heading the district, they are generally assisted by one or two) SPs. Each district is divided into sub-divisions or circles, under a [[deputy superintendent of police]] (DSP). Each sub-division consists of several police stations commanded by an [[Inspector|inspector of police]], who is assisted by [[sub-inspector]]s (SIs) and [[Assistant sub-inspector of police|assistant sub-inspectors]] (ASIs). In rural areas, a sub-inspector is in charge of a police station; sub-inspectors (and higher) can file a charge sheet in court.\n\nDistrict SPs are not empowered as executive magistrates. The [[District magistrate (India)|district magistrate]] (DM, an IAS officer) exercises these powers, which include promulgating Section 144 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (India)|Code of Criminal Procedure]] (CrPC) and issuing arms licenses.\n\n==={{anchor|Criminal Investigation Department}}Criminal investigation department===\nA [[Criminal investigation department#India|criminal investigation department]] (CID) is constituted in each district under a deputy inspector general to collect and distribute information about organized crime.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Police commissionerates===\n[[File:India - Kolkata traffic cop - 3661.jpg|alt=Two mounted-police officers|thumb|Traffic Police directing cars in Kolkata.]]\nSome cities use the police commissionerate system (like [[Kolkata Police Force|Kolkata]], [[Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate]], [[Mumbai Police|Mumbai]], [[Delhi Police|Delhi]] ,[[Pune Police|Pune]] etc.), headed by a [[Police commissioner#India|police commissioner]].Demand for this system is increasing as it gives police a free hand to act freely and take control of any situation.71 large cities and suburban areas currently have this system.Even in British Raj, the presidency towns of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Chennai|Madras]] had commissionerate system.Reporting to the Police Commissioner(CP) are the Joint Police Commissioner(Joint CPs), Deputy Commissioner of Police(DCPs) and Assistant Commissioner of Police(ACPs).Commissioners of police and their deputies are empowered as executive magistrates to enforce [[Unlawful assembly#India|Section 144 of the CrPC]] and issue arms licenses. Police commissionerates are subordinate to the state police except for the [[Kolkata Police Force]], which independently reports to the [[Department of Home (West Bengal)|Department of Home]] of [[Government of West Bengal]].\n\n===Traffic police===\nHighway and traffic police in small towns are under the state police; traffic police in cities are under the metropolitan and state police. Traffic police maintain a smooth traffic flow and stop offenders. Highway police secure the highways and catch speeders. Accidents, registrations, and vehicle data are checked by traffic police.\n\n==={{anchor|State armed police forces}}State Armed Police Forces===\nThe [[State Armed Police Forces]] provide a state with policing in particularly violent or serious situations, such as combating [[banditry]] and [[Naxalite]]s. Like the [[Central Armed Police Forces]], they are known unofficially as paramilitary forces. Each state police force maintains an armed force, with names such as Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and Special Armed Police, which is responsible for emergencies and crowd control. They are generally activated on orders from a [[Deputy inspector general of police#India|deputy inspector general]] or higher-level authorities.

Educational requirements increase for higher posts.\n\nAssistant superintendents of police (ASP) are recruited annually by the independent [[Union Public Service Commission]] by competitive examination, and are appointed to the Indian Police Service. The IPS officers are then assigned to a state force. Trainee officers undergo 44 weeks of initial training, which includes invited lawyers and management consultants. At the end of their probation, they have several weeks of orientation at the state police academy.\n\nNon-managerial positions are selected by the state (or central) government, and are trained at police recruit schools. The length of training for inspectors is about a year; for constables, it is nearly nine months. School training staff is drawn from the police force. Police are trained in basic law, self-protection, weapons handling and other skills at recruit stations. Superior recruits receive special training.\n\nRecruitment for state police is conducted by state police recruitment boards. Eligibility standards are set by the central government, depending on state demographics.\n\n==Transport==\n{|| class=\"wikitable\" \n! Vehicle\n! Origin\n! Use\n!

The [[Mahindra Legend]] Jeep had been the most common police car in India;  other SUVs, such as the [[Maruti Gypsy]], [[Mahindra Bolero]], [[Tata Sumo]], [[Tata Safari]], [[Chevrolet Tavera]] and [[Toyota Qualis]], are now used. SUVs are known for their capability in varied terrain.\n\n[[Minivan]]s are used by police in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, where the Chevrolet Tavera ([[Delhi]], [[Kochi]], [[Kozhikode]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]]), Toyota Qualis ([[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]] and [[Chennai]]) and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga ([[Bangalore]] and Pune) are extensively used. Although most cities use SUVs and minivans, Chennai has adopted [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] such as the [[Hyundai Accent]]; [[Kolkata]] has adopted the [[Tata Indigo]]. In [[Kerala]] cities such as [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kochi]] and [[Kozhikode]], the Pink Patrol (to protect women) uses the [[Toyota Etios]]. \n\nDepending upon the state, police vehicles may have revolving lights, strobes or light bars. A modernisation drive has ensured that vehicles are equipped with [[two-way radio]]s in communication with a central control room. Highway police vehicles generally have [[Speed limit enforcement|radar equipment]], [[Breathalyzer|breath analysers]] and emergency [[first aid kit]]s. For traffic regulation and city patrol, [[motorcycle]]s are also used; most were the Indian version of the [[Royal Enfield Bullet]], but the [[Bajaj Pulsar]] and [[TVS Apache]] are also used.\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\nWeapons and equipment vary from state to state and agency to agency. Standard equipment for a [[constable]] on the [[Beat (police)|beat]] is the lathi, or baton\u2014generally made of [[bamboo]], but currently also made of [[polymer]]. Riot police have other equipment, including [[tear gas]] and [[taser]]s.\n\nAlthough police constables do not generally carry firearms on regular duty, they are available at police stations. Officers at and above the rank of [[sub-inspector]] or head constable are authorized to carry a [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]], generally a [[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]] or a [[Glock 17]]. Officers always carry side arms. Traffic police officers have fine books and other equipment.\n\nFirearms previously stocked at police stations included [[Lee\u2013Enfield|.303 Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles (now replaced), [[FN FAL|7.62 1A]] self-loading rifles and [[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1s]], which have been replaced by [[AK-47]] and [[INSAS rifle]]s. The [[Ordnance Factory Board]] is a supplier of arms, ammunition, uniforms, bullet-proof vehicles, and mine-protected vehicles to the police. Only a station officer can allow the use of reserve guns in emergencies. During public unrest, protests or possible terrorist attacks, police are equipped by the state (or central) government.\n\nSpecial units at the state and federal level have automatic weapons, such as the AK-47, [[AKM]] and INSAS [[assault rifle]]s and [[Bren light machine gun|Bren guns]]. Special-forces and [[SWAT]] units use [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]s, [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9]]s, [[AK-103]]s, [[M4 carbine|M4A1 Carbine]]s and others. Bulletproof jackets are generally not worn by state police, although special units carry tactical vests, gear, and weapons according to function.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Weapon \n!Type\n!Caliber\n!Origin\n!Note\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Handgun|Handguns]]\n|-\n|[[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]]\n|[[File:Pistol Auto 9 mm 1A - Kolkata 2012-01-23 8779.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|[[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n|[[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n|India\n|Standard issue firearm\n|-\n|[[Glock 17]]\n|[[File:Glock 17.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n|}\n|[[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n|Austria\n|Standard Issue Firearm\n|-\n|[[IOF .32 revolver]]\n|[[File:IOF-32-REV-1.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|[[Revolver]]\n|7.65mm x 23mm\n|India\n|Standard issue firearm\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n=== [[Shotgun]] ===\n|-\n|[[OFB pump action Shotgun]]\n|\n|[[Pump action]]\n|[[12-gauge shotgun]]\n|India\n|Used mostly by prison service\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Submachine gun|Sub-Machine Gun]]\n|-\n![[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1]]\n![[File:Sterling SMG.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!India\n!Used by armed police and reserve police\n|-\n![[Heckler & Koch MP5]]\n![[File:Heckler & Koch MP5 b.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!India\n!Used mainly by Police SWAT \n|-\n![[Sten|Sten Sub Machine]]\n![[File:Sten Mk II IMG 4781 (Nemo5576) noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!UK\n!Being phased out\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Assault Rifle/ Battle Rifles\n|-\n![[Ishapore 2A1 rifle]]\n![[File:RFI Rifle 7.62mm 2A1.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Bolt action|bolt-action]]\n![[.303 British|.303 Mk VII SAA Ball]]\n!India\n!Being phased out, mainly retain for ceremonial purpose\n|-\n![[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]]\n![[File:SLRL1A1.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n![[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Being phased out\n|-\n![[AKM]]\n![[File:AKM automatkarbin Ryssland - 7,62x39mm - Arm\u00e9museum rightside noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Assault rifle|Assault  Rifle]]\n![[7.62\u00d739mm]]\n!Bulgaria\n!\n|-\n![[INSAS|1B1 INSAS]]\n![[File:INSAS Standard Issue Assualt Rifle noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Assault rifle|Assault  Rifle]]\n![[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Mainstay of police force\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Light Machine Gun\n|-\n![[Bren light machine gun|GUN MACHINE 7.62MM IA]]\n![[File:Bren wog.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Light machine gun|Light machine Gun]]\n![[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62 x 51 mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Being phased out\n|-\n!INSAS LMG\n![[File:INSAS LMG.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Light machine gun|Light machine Gun]]\n![[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n!India\n!\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|Mukhbir informers network|Mukhbir|Mukhbirs|Informers network|Informers}}''Mukhbir''==\n{{anchor | Mukhbir informers network | Mukhbir }}\n{{Main|Police Mitra scheme}}\nInformers (''mukhbir'') provide information for financial compensation.
