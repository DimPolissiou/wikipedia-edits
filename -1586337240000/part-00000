Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison. The community was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1899, a [[town]] in 1904, and a [[city]] in 1985.<ref name=\"AMACityProfiles\" />\n=== Arrival of the railway ===\n[[File:CNR Station Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=CN Station in Fort Saskatchewan.|left|thumb|300px|Historic [[Fort Saskatchewan station|Fort Saskatchewan railway station]]]]\nPrior to the arrival of the railway, people travelling to and from Edmonton had to traverse a dirt trail that wound around woods and swamps.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

Blue bins were used for recycling in the pilot program, but the city reverted to blue bags when launching the new waste system city-wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/spring-changes-coming-for-waste-collection-in-fort|title=Spring changes coming for the Fort's waste collection|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> This was because objects could get jammed in the blue bins, and crews could not easily tell if the loads inside blue bins were contaminated like they could with blue bags.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]].

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).\n\n===''The Love Song of J.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S.

I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T.

S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), \"[[The Hollow Men]]\" (1925), \"[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]\" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot \"Thomas Stearns Eliot\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].'' He said the results were gloomy and despairing and he destroyed them.<ref name=Hall>Hall, Donald.

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ...

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair.

S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''.

This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin.

The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S.

I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T.

Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W.

For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]].

Both father and son fell ill of malaria. Mongkut died on 1 October 1868. Assuming the 15 year-old Chulalongkorn to be dying as well, King Mongkut on his deathbed wrote, \"My brother, my son, my grandson, whoever you all the senior officials think will be able to save our country will succeed my throne, choose at your own will.\"  [[Si Suriyawongse]], the most powerful government official of the day, managed the succession of Chulalongkorn to the throne and his own appointment as [[regent]]. The first [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation]] was held on 11 November 1868. Chulalongkorn's health improved, and he was tutored in public affairs.\n\nThe young Chulalongkorn was an enthusiastic reformer. He visited Singapore and [[Java]] in 1870 and [[British India]] in 1872 to study the administration of British colonies. He toured the administrative centres of Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, and back to Calcutta in early 1872. This journey was a source of his later ideas for the modernization of Siam. He was crowned king in his own right as Rama V on 16 November 1873.<ref name=YourDictionary/>{{clarify|reason=how is this different from the coronation of 11 November 1868?|date=July 2017}}\n\nSi Suriyawongse then arranged for the [[Front Palace]] of King [[Pinklao]] (who was his uncle) to be bequeathed to King Pinklao's son, Prince [[Yingyot]] (who was Chulalongkorn's cousin).\n\nAs regent, Si Suriyawongse wielded great influence. Si Suriyawongse continued the works of King Mongkut. He supervised the digging of several important [[khlong]]s, such as Padung Krungkasem and Damneun Saduak, and the paving of roads such as Charoen Krung and Silom. He was also a patron of Thai literature and performing arts.\n\n==Early reign==\n[[Image:Rama V c1870.jpg|210px|thumb|upright|right|King Chulalongkorn after his second coronation ceremony in 16 November 1873.]]\nAt the end of his regency, Si Suriyawonse was raised to [[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdej Chao Phraya|Somdet Chao Phraya]], the highest title a noble could attain. Si Suriyawongse was the most powerful noble of the 19th century. His family, [[Bunnag]], was a powerful one, of Persian descent.

As tax collectors had been under the aegis of various nobles and thus a source of their wealth, this reform caused great consternation among the nobility, especially the Front Palace. From the time of King Mongkut, the Front Palace had been the equivalent of a \"second king\", with one-third of national revenue allocated to it. Prince Yingyot of the Front Palace was known to be on friendly terms with many Britons, at a time when the British Empire was considered the enemy of Siam.\n\nIn 1874, Chulalongkorn established the Council of State as a legislative body and a privy council as his personal advisory board based on the British [[privy council]]. Council members were appointed by the monarch.\n\n===Front Palace crisis===\n{{Main|Front Palace crisis}}\n\nOn the night of 28 December 1874, a fire broke out near the gunpowder storehouse and gasworks in the main palace. Front Palace troops quickly arrived, fully armed, \"to assist in putting out the fire\". They were denied entrance and the fire was extinguished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wyatt|first=David K.|title=Thailand: A Short History|year=1982|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0-300-03054-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thailand00davi}}</ref>{{RP|193}} The incident demonstrated the considerable power wielded by aristocrats and royal relatives, leaving the king little power. Reducing the power held by the nobility became one of his main motives in reforming Siam's feudal politics.\n\nWhen Prince Yingyot died in 1885, Chulalongkorn took the opportunity to abolish the titular Front Palace and created the title of \"[[Crown Prince of Thailand|Crown Prince of Siam]]\" in line with Western custom. Chulalongkorn's son, Prince [[Vajirunhis]], was appointed the first Crown Prince of Siam, though he never reigned. In 1895, when the prince died of typhoid at age 16, he was succeeded by his half-brother [[Vajiravudh]], who was then at boarding school in England.\n\n===Haw insurgency===\n[[Image:KING-CHULALONG-KORN.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The young king in western dress]]\n{{Main|Haw wars}}\nIn the northern [[Laos|Laotian lands]] bordering China, the insurgents of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] had taken refuge since the reign of King Mongkut. These Chinese were called ''Haw'' and became bandits, pillaging the villages. In 1875, Chulalongkorn sent troops from Bangkok to crush the Haw who had ravaged as far as [[Vientiane]]. However, they met strong Chinese resistance and retreated to [[Isan]] in 1885. New, modernized forces were sent again and were divided into two groups approaching the Haw from Chiang Kam and Pichai. The Haw scattered and some fled to [[Vietnam]]. The Siamese armies proceeded to eliminate the remaining Haw. The city of [[Nong Khai]] maintains memorials for the Siamese dead.\n\n===Third Anglo-Burmese War===\n{{Main|Third Anglo-Burmese War}}\nIn Burma, while the British Army fought the Burmese [[Konbaung Dynasty]], Siam remained neutral. Britain had agreements with the Bangkok government, which stated that if the British were in conflict with Burma, Siam would send food supplies to the British Army. Chulalongkorn honored the agreement. The British thought that he would send an army to help defeat the Burmese, but he did not do so.\n\n===Military and political reforms===\n[[File:Devavongse, Chulalongkorn, Damrong.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Prince [[Devawongse Varopakarn]] (Foreign Minister), King Chulalongkorn and Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] (Interior Minister).

His upgraded forces provided the king much more power to centralize the country.\n\nThe government of Siam had remained largely unchanged since the 15th century. The central government was headed by the ''Samuha Nayok'' (i.e., prime minister), who controlled the northern parts of Siam, and the ''Samuha Kalahom'' (i.e., grand commander), who controlled southern Siam in both civil and military affairs. The Samuha Nayok presided over the ''Chatu Sadombh'' (i.e., Four Pillars). The responsibilities of each pillar overlapped and were ambiguous. In 1888, Chulalongkorn moved to institute a government of ministries. Ministers were, at the outset, members of the royal family. Ministries were established in 1892, with all ministries having equal status.\n\nThe Council of State proved unable to veto legal drafts or to give Chulalongkorn advice because the members regarded Chulalongkorn as an absolute monarch, far above their station. Chulalongkorn dissolved the council altogether and transferred advisory duties to the cabinet in 1894.\n\nChulalongkorn abolished the traditional Nakorn Bala methods of torture in the judiciary process, which were seen as inhumane and barbaric to Western eyes, and introduced a Western judicial code. His Belgian advisor, [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns|Rolin-Jaequemyns]], played a great role in the development of modern Siamese law and its judicial system.\n\n===Call for democracy===\n{{Chakri Kings}}\n[[Image:Chulalongkorn and Princes.jpg|thumb|left|King Chulalongkorn with a few of his sons at [[Eton College]] in the United Kingdom in 1907]]\nChulalongkorn was the first Siamese king to send royal princes to [[Europe]] to be educated. In 19th century Europe, nationalism flourished and there were calls for more liberty. The princes were influenced by the liberal notions of [[democracy]] and elections they encountered in republics like [[Third French Republic|France]] and [[constitutional monarchies]] like the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\nIn 1884 (year 103 of the [[Thai solar calendar|Rattakosin Era]]), Siamese officials in London and Paris warned Chulalongkorn of threats from European colonialism. They advised that Siam should be reformed like [[Meiji Era|Meiji Japan]] and that Siam should become a constitutional monarchy. Chulalongkorn demurred, stating that the time was not ripe and that he himself was making reforms.\n\nThroughout Chulalongkorn's reign, writers with radical ideas had their works published for the first time. The most notable ones included [[Thianwan Wannapho]], who had been imprisoned for 17 years and from prison produced many works criticizing traditional Siamese society.\n\n==Conflict with French Indochina==\n[[File:Young king Chulalongkorn 1872.jpg|thumb|left|King Chulalongkorn in 1872]]\n{{main|Franco-Siamese War}}\nIn 1863, King [[Norodom]] of Cambodia was forced to put his country under French protection. The cession of Cambodia was officially formulated in 1867. However, Inner Cambodia (as called in Siam) consisting of [[Battambang]], [[Siem Reap]], and [[Srisopon]], remained a Siamese possession. This was the first of many territorial cessions.\n\nIn 1887, French Indochina was formed from Vietnam and [[Cambodia]]. In 1888, French troops invaded northern Laos to subjugate the Heo insurgents. However, the French troops never left, and the French demanded more Laotian lands. In 1893 [[Auguste Pavie]], the French vice-consul of [[Luang Prabang]], requested the cession of all Laotian lands east of the [[Mekong River]]. Siam resented the demand, leading to the [[Franco\u2013Siamese War]] of 1893.\n\nThe French gunboat ''Le Lutin'' entered the [[Chao Phraya]] and anchored near the French consulate ready to attack. Fighting was observed in Laos. ''Inconstant'' and ''Comete'' were attacked in Chao Phraya, and the French sent an ultimatum: an indemnity of three million francs, as well as the cession of and withdrawal from Laos. Siam did not accept the ultimatum. French troops then blockaded the [[Gulf of Siam]] and occupied [[Chantaburi]] and [[Trat]]. Chulalongkorn sent Rolin-Jacquemyns to negotiate. The issue was eventually settled with the cession of Laos in 1893, but the French troops in Chantaburi and Trat refused to leave.\n\nThe cession of vast Laotian lands had a major impact on Chulalongkorn's spirit. Prince [[Vajirunhis]] died in 1894. Prince [[Vajiravudh]] was created crown prince to replace him. Chulalongkorn realised the importance of maintaining the navy and established the [[Royal Thai Navy Academy|Royal Thai Naval Academy]] in 1898.\n\nDespite Siamese concessions, French armies continued the occupation of Chantaburi and Trat for another 10 years. An agreement was reached in 1903 that French troops would leave Chantaburi but hold the coast land from Trat to [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]]. In 1906, the final agreement was reached. Trat was returned to Siam but the French kept Koh Kong and received Inner Cambodia.\n\nSeeing the seriousness of foreign affairs, Chulalongkorn visited Europe in 1897. He was the first Siamese monarch to do so, and he desired European recognition of Siam as a fully independent power. He appointed his queen, Saovabha, as regent in Siam during his travel to Europe.\n\n==Reforms==\n[[File:Ruling-monarchs.jpg|210px|right|thumb|upright|Postcard from 1908, depicting King Chulalongkorn (above left) with contemporary monarchs]]\nSiam had been composed of a network of cities according to the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala system]] codified by King [[Trailokanat#Reforms|Trailokanat]] in 1454, with local rulers owing tribute to [[Bangkok]]. Each city retained a substantial degree of autonomy, as Siam was not a \"state\" but a \"network\" of city-states.  With the rise of European colonialism, the Western concept of state and territorial division was introduced. It had to define explicitly which lands were \"Siamese\" and which lands were \"foreign\". The conflict with the French in 1893 was an example.\n\n=== Sukhaphiban districts ===\n[[Sukhaphiban]] ({{lang|th|\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e32\u0e20\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25}}) [[sanitary district]]s were the first sub-autonomous entities established in Thailand. The first such was created in Bangkok, by royal decree of King Chulalongkorn in 1897. During his European tour earlier that year, he had learned about the sanitary districts of England, and wanted to try out this local administrative unit in his capital.\n\n=== Monthon system ===\nWith his experiences during the travel to British colonies and the suggestion of [[Prince Damrong]], Chulalongkorn established the hierarchical system of [[monthon]]s in 1897, composed of [[Provinces of Thailand|province]], [[Mueang#Thailand|city]], ''[[amphoe]]'', ''[[tambon]]'', and ''[[muban]]'' (village) in descending order. (Though an entire monthon, the Eastern Province, Inner Cambodia, was ceded to the French in 1906).  Each monthon was overseen by an [[intendant]] of the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]]. This had a major impact, as it ended the power of all local dynasties. Central authority now spread all over the country through the administration of intendants. For example, the [[Lanna]] states in the north (including the [[Kingdom of Chiangmai]], Principalities of [[Lampang]], [[Lamphun]], [[Nan, Thailand|Nan]], and [[Prae]], tributaries to Bangkok) were made into two monthons, neglecting the existence of the [[List of the Kings of Lanna#Lanna states under Siamese tributary 1775\u20131899|Lanna kings]].\n\nLocal rulers did not cede power willingly. Three rebellions sprang up in 1901: the [[Ngeaw rebellion]] in [[Phrae]], the 1901\u20131902 Holy Man's Rebellion<ref name=\"JSS_062_1e_Murdoch\">{{cite journal | last = Murdoch | first =  John B. | authorlink = |year= 1974\n|title=  The 1901\u20131902 Holy Man's Rebellion |journal= [[Journal of the Siam Society]] |volume= JSS Vol.62.1 |issue= digital |page= |pages=  |nopp= <!-- hides automatic 'p' or 'pp'. -->|publisher= Siam Heritage Trust |doi= |url= http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_062_1e_Murdoch_1901to1902HolyMansRebellion.pdf|accessdate= 2 April 2013\n|quote= The background to the rebellion must be sought in the factors that led up to the situation in the Lower Mekong at the turn of the century.

Second were the outer provinces, which were situated between the inner provinces and further distant tributary states.

Each man at the time of his majority had to register with a government bureau, department, or leading member of the royalty called {{lang|th-Latn|krom}} ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e21}}) as a {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Luang}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07}})  or under a nobleman's dominion ({{lang|th-Latn|Moon Nai}} or {{lang|th-Latn|Chao Khun Moon Nai}} {{lang|th|\u0e21\u0e39\u0e25\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e21\u0e39\u0e25\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22}}) as a {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Som}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e21}}). {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai}} owed service to sovereign or master for three months of the year. {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Suay}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22}}) were those who could make payment [[in kind]] (cattle) in lieu of service. Those conscripted into military service were called {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Tahan}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23}}).\n\nChulalongkorn was best known for his abolition of [[Siamese slavery]] ([[:th:\u0e17\u0e32\u0e2a|\u0e17\u0e32\u0e2a]].) He associated the abolition of slavery in the United States with the bloodshed of the [[American Civil War]]. Chulalongkorn, to prevent such a bloodbath in Siam, provided several steps towards the abolition of slavery, not an extreme turning point from servitude to total freedom. Those who found themselves unable to live on their own sold themselves into slavery by rich noblemen. Likewise, when a debt was defaulted, the borrower would become a slave of the lender. If the debt was redeemed, the slave regained freedom.\n\nHowever, those whose parents were household slaves (\u0e17\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e49\u0e22) were bound to be slaves forever because their redemption price was extremely high.\n\nBecause of economic conditions, people sold themselves into slavery in great numbers and in turn they produced a large number of household slaves. In 1867 they accounted for one-third of Siamese population. In 1874, Chulalongkorn enacted a law that lowered the redemption price of household slaves born in 1867 (his ascension year) and freed all of them when they had reached 21.\n\nThe newly freed slaves would have time to settle themselves as farmers or merchants so they would not become unemployed. In 1905, the ''[[Slave Abolition Act]]'' ended Siamese slavery in all forms. The reverse of 100 [[Thai baht|baht]] banknotes in circulation since the 2005 centennial depict Chulalongkorn in navy uniform abolishing the slave tradition.\n\nThe traditional corv\u00e9e system declined after the [[Bowring Treaty]], which gave rise to a new class of employed labourers not regulated by the government, while many noblemen continued to hold sway over large numbers of {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Som}}. Chulalongkorn needed  more effective control of manpower to undo the power of nobility. After the establishment of the [[monthon]] system, Chulalongkorn instituted a census to count all men available to the government. The ''[[Employment Act (Siam)|Employment Act]]'' of 1900 required that all workers be paid, not forced to work.\n\n===Establishment of a modern army and modern land ownership===\n[[File:Grand Palace Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|thumb|right|The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall in the [[Grand Palace]] was completed in 1882.]]\n[[File:VimanmekMansion.jpg|thumb|right|The king built the [[Vimanmek Palace]], 1900.

The first [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation]] was held on 11 November 1868. Chulalongkorn's health improved, and he was tutored in public affairs.\n\nThe young Chulalongkorn was an enthusiastic reformer. He visited Singapore and [[Java]] in 1870 and [[British India]] in 1872 to study the administration of British colonies. He toured the administrative centres of Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, and back to Calcutta in early 1872. This journey was a source of his later ideas for the modernization of Siam. He was crowned king in his own right as Rama V on 16 November 1873.<ref name=YourDictionary/>{{clarify|reason=how is this different from the coronation of 11 November 1868?|date=July 2017}}\n\nSi Suriyawongse then arranged for the [[Front Palace]] of King [[Pinklao]] (who was his uncle) to be bequeathed to King Pinklao's son, Prince [[Yingyot]] (who was Chulalongkorn's cousin).\n\nAs regent, Si Suriyawongse wielded great influence. Si Suriyawongse continued the works of King Mongkut. He supervised the digging of several important [[khlong]]s, such as Padung Krungkasem and Damneun Saduak, and the paving of roads such as Charoen Krung and Silom.

As tax collectors had been under the aegis of various nobles and thus a source of their wealth, this reform caused great consternation among the nobility, especially the Front Palace. From the time of King Mongkut, the Front Palace had been the equivalent of a \"second king\", with one-third of national revenue allocated to it. Prince Yingyot of the Front Palace was known to be on friendly terms with many Britons, at a time when the British Empire was considered the enemy of Siam.\n\nIn 1874, Chulalongkorn established the Council of State as a legislative body and a privy council as his personal advisory board based on the British [[privy council]]. Council members were appointed by the monarch.\n\n===Front Palace crisis===\n{{Main|Front Palace crisis}}\n\nOn the night of 28 December 1874, a fire broke out near the gunpowder storehouse and gasworks in the main palace. Front Palace troops quickly arrived, fully armed, \"to assist in putting out the fire\".

Reducing the power held by the nobility became one of his main motives in reforming Siam's feudal politics.\n\nWhen Prince Yingyot died in 1885, Chulalongkorn took the opportunity to abolish the titular Front Palace and created the title of \"[[Crown Prince of Thailand|Crown Prince of Siam]]\" in line with Western custom. Chulalongkorn's son, Prince [[Vajirunhis]], was appointed the first Crown Prince of Siam, though he never reigned. In 1895, when the prince died of typhoid at age 16, he was succeeded by his half-brother [[Vajiravudh]], who was then at boarding school in England.\n\n===Haw insurgency===\n[[Image:KING-CHULALONG-KORN.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The young king in western dress]]\n{{Main|Haw wars}}\nIn the northern [[Laos|Laotian lands]] bordering China, the insurgents of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] had taken refuge since the reign of King Mongkut. These Chinese were called ''Haw'' and became bandits, pillaging the villages. In 1875, Chulalongkorn sent troops from Bangkok to crush the Haw who had ravaged as far as [[Vientiane]]. However, they met strong Chinese resistance and retreated to [[Isan]] in 1885. New, modernized forces were sent again and were divided into two groups approaching the Haw from Chiang Kam and Pichai. The Haw scattered and some fled to [[Vietnam]]. The Siamese armies proceeded to eliminate the remaining Haw. The city of [[Nong Khai]] maintains memorials for the Siamese dead.\n\n===Third Anglo-Burmese War===\n{{Main|Third Anglo-Burmese War}}\nIn Burma, while the British Army fought the Burmese [[Konbaung Dynasty]], Siam remained neutral. Britain had agreements with the Bangkok government, which stated that if the British were in conflict with Burma, Siam would send food supplies to the British Army. Chulalongkorn honored the agreement. The British thought that he would send an army to help defeat the Burmese, but he did not do so.\n\n===Military and political reforms===\n[[File:Devavongse, Chulalongkorn, Damrong.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Prince [[Devawongse Varopakarn]] (Foreign Minister), King Chulalongkorn and Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] (Interior Minister).

His upgraded forces provided the king much more power to centralize the country.\n\nThe government of Siam had remained largely unchanged since the 15th century. The central government was headed by the ''Samuha Nayok'' (i.e., prime minister), who controlled the northern parts of Siam, and the ''Samuha Kalahom'' (i.e., grand commander), who controlled southern Siam in both civil and military affairs. The Samuha Nayok presided over the ''Chatu Sadombh'' (i.e., Four Pillars). The responsibilities of each pillar overlapped and were ambiguous. In 1888, Chulalongkorn moved to institute a government of ministries. Ministers were, at the outset, members of the royal family. Ministries were established in 1892, with all ministries having equal status.\n\nThe Council of State proved unable to veto legal drafts or to give Chulalongkorn advice because the members regarded Chulalongkorn as an absolute monarch, far above their station. Chulalongkorn dissolved the council altogether and transferred advisory duties to the cabinet in 1894.\n\nChulalongkorn abolished the traditional Nakorn Bala methods of torture in the judiciary process, which were seen as inhumane and barbaric to Western eyes, and introduced a Western judicial code. His Belgian advisor, [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns|Rolin-Jaequemyns]], played a great role in the development of modern Siamese law and its judicial system.\n\n===Call for democracy===\n{{Chakri Kings}}\n[[Image:Chulalongkorn and Princes.jpg|thumb|left|King Chulalongkorn with a few of his sons at [[Eton College]] in the United Kingdom in 1907]]\nChulalongkorn was the first Siamese king to send royal princes to [[Europe]] to be educated. In 19th century Europe, nationalism flourished and there were calls for more liberty. The princes were influenced by the liberal notions of [[democracy]] and elections they encountered in republics like [[Third French Republic|France]] and [[constitutional monarchies]] like the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\nIn 1884 (year 103 of the [[Thai solar calendar|Rattakosin Era]]), Siamese officials in London and Paris warned Chulalongkorn of threats from European colonialism. They advised that Siam should be reformed like [[Meiji Era|Meiji Japan]] and that Siam should become a constitutional monarchy. Chulalongkorn demurred, stating that the time was not ripe and that he himself was making reforms.\n\nThroughout Chulalongkorn's reign, writers with radical ideas had their works published for the first time. The most notable ones included [[Thianwan Wannapho]], who had been imprisoned for 17 years and from prison produced many works criticizing traditional Siamese society.\n\n==Conflict with French Indochina==\n[[File:Young king Chulalongkorn 1872.jpg|thumb|left|King Chulalongkorn in 1872]]\n{{main|Franco-Siamese War}}\nIn 1863, King [[Norodom]] of Cambodia was forced to put his country under French protection. The cession of Cambodia was officially formulated in 1867. However, Inner Cambodia (as called in Siam) consisting of [[Battambang]], [[Siem Reap]], and [[Srisopon]], remained a Siamese possession. This was the first of many territorial cessions.\n\nIn 1887, French Indochina was formed from Vietnam and [[Cambodia]]. In 1888, French troops invaded northern Laos to subjugate the Heo insurgents. However, the French troops never left, and the French demanded more Laotian lands. In 1893 [[Auguste Pavie]], the French vice-consul of [[Luang Prabang]], requested the cession of all Laotian lands east of the [[Mekong River]]. Siam resented the demand, leading to the [[Franco\u2013Siamese War]] of 1893.\n\nThe French gunboat ''Le Lutin'' entered the [[Chao Phraya]] and anchored near the French consulate ready to attack. Fighting was observed in Laos. ''Inconstant'' and ''Comete'' were attacked in Chao Phraya, and the French sent an ultimatum: an indemnity of three million francs, as well as the cession of and withdrawal from Laos. Siam did not accept the ultimatum. French troops then blockaded the [[Gulf of Siam]] and occupied [[Chantaburi]] and [[Trat]]. Chulalongkorn sent Rolin-Jacquemyns to negotiate. The issue was eventually settled with the cession of Laos in 1893, but the French troops in Chantaburi and Trat refused to leave.\n\nThe cession of vast Laotian lands had a major impact on Chulalongkorn's spirit. Prince [[Vajirunhis]] died in 1894. Prince [[Vajiravudh]] was created crown prince to replace him. Chulalongkorn realised the importance of maintaining the navy and established the [[Royal Thai Navy Academy|Royal Thai Naval Academy]] in 1898.\n\nDespite Siamese concessions, French armies continued the occupation of Chantaburi and Trat for another 10 years. An agreement was reached in 1903 that French troops would leave Chantaburi but hold the coast land from Trat to [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]]. In 1906, the final agreement was reached. Trat was returned to Siam but the French kept Koh Kong and received Inner Cambodia.\n\nSeeing the seriousness of foreign affairs, Chulalongkorn visited Europe in 1897. He was the first Siamese monarch to do so, and he desired European recognition of Siam as a fully independent power. He appointed his queen, Saovabha, as regent in Siam during his travel to Europe.\n\n==Reforms==\n[[File:Ruling-monarchs.jpg|210px|right|thumb|upright|Postcard from 1908, depicting King Chulalongkorn (above left) with contemporary monarchs]]\nSiam had been composed of a network of cities according to the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala system]] codified by King [[Trailokanat#Reforms|Trailokanat]] in 1454, with local rulers owing tribute to [[Bangkok]]. Each city retained a substantial degree of autonomy, as Siam was not a \"state\" but a \"network\" of city-states.  With the rise of European colonialism, the Western concept of state and territorial division was introduced. It had to define explicitly which lands were \"Siamese\" and which lands were \"foreign\". The conflict with the French in 1893 was an example.\n\n=== Sukhaphiban districts ===\n[[Sukhaphiban]] ({{lang|th|\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e32\u0e20\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25}}) [[sanitary district]]s were the first sub-autonomous entities established in Thailand. The first such was created in Bangkok, by royal decree of King Chulalongkorn in 1897. During his European tour earlier that year, he had learned about the sanitary districts of England, and wanted to try out this local administrative unit in his capital.\n\n=== Monthon system ===\nWith his experiences during the travel to British colonies and the suggestion of [[Prince Damrong]], Chulalongkorn established the hierarchical system of [[monthon]]s in 1897, composed of [[Provinces of Thailand|province]], [[Mueang#Thailand|city]], ''[[amphoe]]'', ''[[tambon]]'', and ''[[muban]]'' (village) in descending order. (Though an entire monthon, the Eastern Province, Inner Cambodia, was ceded to the French in 1906).  Each monthon was overseen by an [[intendant]] of the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]]. This had a major impact, as it ended the power of all local dynasties. Central authority now spread all over the country through the administration of intendants. For example, the [[Lanna]] states in the north (including the [[Kingdom of Chiangmai]], Principalities of [[Lampang]], [[Lamphun]], [[Nan, Thailand|Nan]], and [[Prae]], tributaries to Bangkok) were made into two monthons, neglecting the existence of the [[List of the Kings of Lanna#Lanna states under Siamese tributary 1775\u20131899|Lanna kings]].\n\nLocal rulers did not cede power willingly. Three rebellions sprang up in 1901: the [[Ngeaw rebellion]] in [[Phrae]], the 1901\u20131902 Holy Man's Rebellion<ref name=\"JSS_062_1e_Murdoch\">{{cite journal | last = Murdoch | first =  John B. | authorlink = |year= 1974\n|title=  The 1901\u20131902 Holy Man's Rebellion |journal= [[Journal of the Siam Society]] |volume= JSS Vol.62.1 |issue= digital |page= |pages=  |nopp= <!-- hides automatic 'p' or 'pp'. -->|publisher= Siam Heritage Trust |doi= |url= http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_062_1e_Murdoch_1901to1902HolyMansRebellion.pdf|accessdate= 2 April 2013\n|quote= The background to the rebellion must be sought in the factors that led up to the situation in the Lower Mekong at the turn of the century.

Each man at the time of his majority had to register with a government bureau, department, or leading member of the royalty called {{lang|th-Latn|krom}} ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e21}}) as a {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Luang}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07}})  or under a nobleman's dominion ({{lang|th-Latn|Moon Nai}} or {{lang|th-Latn|Chao Khun Moon Nai}} {{lang|th|\u0e21\u0e39\u0e25\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e21\u0e39\u0e25\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22}}) as a {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Som}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e21}}). {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai}} owed service to sovereign or master for three months of the year. {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Suay}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22}}) were those who could make payment [[in kind]] (cattle) in lieu of service. Those conscripted into military service were called {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Tahan}} ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23}}).\n\nChulalongkorn was best known for his abolition of [[Siamese slavery]] ([[:th:\u0e17\u0e32\u0e2a|\u0e17\u0e32\u0e2a]].) He associated the abolition of slavery in the United States with the bloodshed of the [[American Civil War]]. Chulalongkorn, to prevent such a bloodbath in Siam, provided several steps towards the abolition of slavery, not an extreme turning point from servitude to total freedom. Those who found themselves unable to live on their own sold themselves into slavery by rich noblemen. Likewise, when a debt was defaulted, the borrower would become a slave of the lender. If the debt was redeemed, the slave regained freedom.\n\nHowever, those whose parents were household slaves (\u0e17\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e49\u0e22) were bound to be slaves forever because their redemption price was extremely high.\n\nBecause of economic conditions, people sold themselves into slavery in great numbers and in turn they produced a large number of household slaves. In 1867 they accounted for one-third of Siamese population. In 1874, Chulalongkorn enacted a law that lowered the redemption price of household slaves born in 1867 (his ascension year) and freed all of them when they had reached 21.\n\nThe newly freed slaves would have time to settle themselves as farmers or merchants so they would not become unemployed. In 1905, the ''[[Slave Abolition Act]]'' ended Siamese slavery in all forms. The reverse of 100 [[Thai baht|baht]] banknotes in circulation since the 2005 centennial depict Chulalongkorn in navy uniform abolishing the slave tradition.\n\nThe traditional corv\u00e9e system declined after the [[Bowring Treaty]], which gave rise to a new class of employed labourers not regulated by the government, while many noblemen continued to hold sway over large numbers of {{lang|th-Latn|Phrai Som}}. Chulalongkorn needed  more effective control of manpower to undo the power of nobility. After the establishment of the [[monthon]] system, Chulalongkorn instituted a census to count all men available to the government. The ''[[Employment Act (Siam)|Employment Act]]'' of 1900 required that all workers be paid, not forced to work.\n\n===Establishment of a modern army and modern land ownership===\n[[File:Grand Palace Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|thumb|right|The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall in the [[Grand Palace]] was completed in 1882.]]\n[[File:VimanmekMansion.jpg|thumb|right|The king built the [[Vimanmek Palace]], 1900.

It was cast in bronze by a Parisian metallurgist.\n\nChulalongkorn had visited Europe twice, in 1897 and 1907. In 1897 he travelled widely through Europe, learning all he could on many subjects to benefit the Siamese  people. He travelled and visited many European royal families. He spent much time in Britain and was inspired, among other things, to improve the health of his people by creating public health, or sanitary districts. In Sweden he studied the Forestry system. The 1907 visit was to his sons at school in Britain and to consult with European doctors in pursuit of a cure for his kidney disease.\n\nHis last accomplishment was the establishment of a public sanitary sewer and plumbing system in 1908 {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. He died on 23 October 1910 of kidney disease at the [[Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall]] in the [[Dusit Palace]], and was succeeded by his son [[Vajiravudh]] (King Rama VI).\n\n[[Chulalongkorn University]], founded in 1917 as the first university in Thailand, was named in his honour. On the campus stand the statues of Rama V and his son, Rama VI.\n\nIn 1997 a [[King Chulalongkorn Memorial Building|memorial pavilion]] was raised in honour of King Chulalongkorn in [[Ragunda]], Sweden. This was done to commemorate King Chulalongkorn's visit to [[Sweden]] in 1897 when he also visited the [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|World's Fair in Brussels]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thai-blogs.com/2010/11/16/hm-king-chulalongkorns-1897-journey-to-europe/ | title=HM King Chulalongkorn's 1897 Journey to Europe | publisher=WordPress | work=Thai Blogs | date=16 November 2010 | accessdate=6 July 2018 | author=Tips, Walter E.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis as soldiers served in the all of the [[Princely state|Princely States]] of Gujarat.

By the year 1734, Kolis of Gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They were well known for their infamous activities at sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked Koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of Koli pirates after six months, and ten more vessels were fired by British. Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli.

Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time.

Regulations specify which such deductions must be verifiable to be allowed (e.g., receipts for donations of $250 or more).\n\nDue to the tax deductions associated with donations, loss of 501(c)(3) status can be highly challenging if not fatal to a charity's continued operation, as many foundations and corporate [[matching funds]] do not grant funds to a charity without such status, and individual donors often do not donate to such a charity due to the unavailability of the deduction.\n\n== Types ==\nThe two exempt classifications of 501(c)(3) organizations are as follows:<ref>IRS, [https://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=136459,00.html \"Life Cycle of a Public Charity/Private Foundation\"], IRS.gov, Retrieved March 9, 2009.</ref>\n* A [[Charitable organization#United States|public charity]], identified by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as \"not a private foundation\", normally receives a substantial part of its income, directly or indirectly, from the general public or from the government. The public support must be fairly broad, not limited to a few individuals or families. Public charities are defined in the Internal Revenue Code under sections 509(a)(0) through 509(a)(4).\n* A [[private foundation (United States)|private foundation]], sometimes called a non-operating foundation, receives most of its income from investments and endowments. This income is used to make grants to other organizations, rather than being disbursed directly for charitable activities. Private foundations are defined in the Internal Revenue Code under section 509(a) as 501(c)(3) organizations, which do not qualify as public charities.\n\n== Obtaining status ==\nThe basic requirement of obtaining tax-exempt status is that the organization is specifically limited in powers to purposes that the IRS classifies as tax-exempt purposes. Unlike for-profit corporations that benefit from broad and general purposes, non-profit organizations need to be limited in powers to function with tax-exempt status, but a non-profit corporation is by default not limited in powers until it specifically limits itself in the articles of incorporation or nonprofit corporate bylaws. This limiting of the powers is crucial to obtaining tax exempt status with the IRS and then on the state level.<ref>\"[https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations IRS Exemption requirements: 501(c)(3) organizations]\".

For example, certain voter education activities (including presenting public forums and publishing voter education guides) conducted in a non-partisan manner do not constitute prohibited political campaign activity. In addition, other activities intended to encourage people to participate in the electoral process, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, would not be prohibited political campaign activity if conducted in a non-partisan manner.\n\nOn the other hand, voter education or registration activities with evidence of bias that (a) favor one candidate over another, (b) oppose a candidate in some manner, or (c) favor a candidate or group of candidates, constitute prohibited participation or intervention.}}\n\n===Constitutionality===\nSince section 501(c)(3)'s political-activity prohibition was enacted, \"commentators and litigants have challenged the provision on numerous constitutional grounds,\" such as [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]], [[Vagueness doctrine|vagueness]], and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] and selective prosecution.<ref name=\"Klapach\">Joseph S.

Regulations specify which such deductions must be verifiable to be allowed (e.g., receipts for donations of $250 or more).\n\nDue to the tax deductions associated with donations, loss of 501(c)(3) status can be highly challenging if not fatal to a charity's continued operation, as many foundations and corporate [[matching funds]] do not grant funds to a charity without such status, and individual donors often do not donate to such a charity due to the unavailability of the deduction.\n\n== Types ==\nThe two exempt classifications of 501(c)(3) organizations are as follows:<ref>IRS, [https://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=136459,00.html \"Life Cycle of a Public Charity/Private Foundation\"], IRS.gov, Retrieved March 9, 2009.</ref>\n* A [[Charitable organization#United States|public charity]], identified by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as \"not a private foundation\", normally receives a substantial part of its income, directly or indirectly, from the general public or from the government. The public support must be fairly broad, not limited to a few individuals or families. Public charities are defined in the Internal Revenue Code under sections 509(a)(0) through 509(a)(4).\n* A [[private foundation (United States)|private foundation]], sometimes called a non-operating foundation, receives most of its income from investments and endowments. This income is used to make grants to other organizations, rather than being disbursed directly for charitable activities. Private foundations are defined in the Internal Revenue Code under section 509(a) as 501(c)(3) organizations, which do not qualify as public charities.\n\n== Obtaining status ==\nThe basic requirement of obtaining tax-exempt status is that the organization is specifically limited in powers to purposes that the IRS classifies as tax-exempt purposes. Unlike for-profit corporations that benefit from broad and general purposes, non-profit organizations need to be limited in powers to function with tax-exempt status, but a non-profit corporation is by default not limited in powers until it specifically limits itself in the articles of incorporation or nonprofit corporate bylaws. This limiting of the powers is crucial to obtaining tax exempt status with the IRS and then on the state level.<ref>\"[https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations IRS Exemption requirements: 501(c)(3) organizations]\".

Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.\n\nCertain activities or expenditures may not be prohibited depending on the facts and circumstances.  For example, certain voter education activities (including presenting public forums and publishing voter education guides) conducted in a non-partisan manner do not constitute prohibited political campaign activity. In addition, other activities intended to encourage people to participate in the electoral process, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, would not be prohibited political campaign activity if conducted in a non-partisan manner.\n\nOn the other hand, voter education or registration activities with evidence of bias that (a) favor one candidate over another, (b) oppose a candidate in some manner, or (c) favor a candidate or group of candidates, constitute prohibited participation or intervention.}}\n\n===Constitutionality===\nSince section 501(c)(3)'s political-activity prohibition was enacted, \"commentators and litigants have challenged the provision on numerous constitutional grounds,\" such as [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]], [[Vagueness doctrine|vagueness]], and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] and selective prosecution.<ref name=\"Klapach\">Joseph S.
