''[[The Hard Goodbye]]'' is about an ex-convict who embarks on a rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer. ''[[The Big Fat Kill]]'' follows a private investigator<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/fj5jnd/sin-city/|title=Sin City \u2013 review {{!}} cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> who gets caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police and the mob. ''[[That Yellow Bastard]]'' focuses on an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured [[serial killer]]. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story \"The Customer is Always Right\" which is collected in ''Booze, Broads & Bullets'', the sixth book in the comic series.\n\nThe film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Jessica Alba]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Elijah Wood]]. Featuring [[Alexis Bledel]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Jaime King]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Nick Stahl]], and [[Makenzie Vega]] among others.\n\n''Sin City'' opened to wide critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film's unique color processing which rendered most of the film in black and white while retaining or adding color for selected objects. The film was screened at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in competition and won the Technical Grand Prize for the film's \"visual shaping\".<ref name=\"Festival-Cannes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4278140/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Sin City |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |work=Festival-Cannes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cannes_Film_Festival/2005#Technical_Grand_Prize |title=Cannes Film Festival (2005) |work=IMDb |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228072730/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cannes_Film_Festival/2005#Technical_Grand_Prize |archivedate=December 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n===\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part I)\"===\nThe Salesman walks onto a penthouse balcony where The Customer looks out over Basin City. He offers her a cigarette and says that she looks like someone who is tired of running and that he will save her. The two share a kiss and he shoots her; she dies in his arms. He says he will never know what she was running from but that he will cash her <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE. -->check <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE. -->in the morning. <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE.-->\n\n===\"That Yellow Bastard (Part I)\"===\nOn the docks of Sin City, aging police officer [[John Hartigan]] tries to stop serial child-killer [[Roark Junior]] from raping and killing his fourth known victim, eleven-year-old [[Nancy Callahan]]. Junior is the son of [[Roark family#Senator Roark|Senator Roark]], who has bribed the police to cover up his son's crimes. Hartigan's corrupt partner, Bob tries to convince Hartigan to walk away; Hartigan knocks him out.\n\nHartigan, experiencing pain from a [[Angina pectoris|bad heart]], heads into the warehouse where Roark Junior and several henchmen are holding Nancy. Junior shoots Hartigan in the shoulder and tries to escape. Hartigan catches up and shoots off Junior's ear, hand and genitals. Bob, now recovered, shoots Hartigan in the back. As the sirens approach, Bob leaves and Nancy lies down in Hartigan's lap. Hartigan passes out, reasoning his death is a fair trade for the girl's life.\n\n===\"The Hard Goodbye\"===\nAfter a [[one-night stand]], [[Marv (Sin City)|Marv]] awakens to find [[Goldie and Wendy|Goldie]] has been killed while he slept. He flees the frame-up as the police arrive, vowing to avenge her death. His [[parole officer]], Lucille, warns him to give up on this mission, believing Marv may have imagined it all due to his \"condition\". Marv interrogates several informants, working up to a corrupt priest, who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. Marv kills the priest but is then attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie, which he dismisses as a hallucination.\n\nMarv goes to the Roark family farm and is subdued by the silent stalker who killed Goldie. He awakens in the basement to find Lucille has been captured after looking into his story. She tells Marv that the killer is a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] and that Goldie was a prostitute. He learns that the killer's name is Kevin and escapes. Lucille is shot by the leader of a squad of corrupt cops. Marv kills the cops except for their leader, whom he interrogates. He learns that Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie's murder.\n\nMarv goes to Old Town, Sin City's prostitute-run [[red-light district]], to learn more about Goldie and is captured by her twin sister, [[Goldie and Wendy|Wendy]], the attacker Marv previously dismissed as a hallucination. Once he convinces Wendy that he is not the killer, the two return to the farm where Marv kills Kevin. He confronts Cardinal Roark, who confesses his part in the murders. Kevin was the cardinal's ward; the two men ate the prostitutes to \"consume their souls\". Marv kills the cardinal but is then shot and captured by his guards.\n\nMarv is taken to a hospital where cops threaten to kill his mother, to get him to confess to killing Roark, Kevin and their victims. He is [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in the [[electric chair]]. Wendy visits him on [[death row]] and thanks him for avenging her sister. Marv is then executed.\n\n===\"The Big Fat Kill\"===\nShellie is being harassed by her [[domestic violence|abusive]] ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy and his cronies. Her boyfriend, Dwight violently warns him to leave Shellie alone. Jackie Boy and his cronies flee to Old Town. Dwight follows and sees them harass Becky, a young prostitute. Gail, the prostitutes' leader and Dwight's on-and-off lover, also witnesses the scene. When Jackie Boy threatens Becky with a gun, [[Miho (Sin City)|Miho]], a martial arts expert, kills Jackie Boy and his friends. They realize Jackie Boy is actually Detective Lieutenant [[Jack Rafferty]] of the Basin City Police, considered a \"hero cop\" by the press. If the cops learn how he died, their truce with the prostitutes would end and the mob would be free to wage war on Old Town.\n\nDwight takes the bodies to a [[tar pit]], where he is attacked by an ex-[[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] mercenary hired by mob boss Wallenquist. He nearly drowns in the tar before Miho saves him. The mercenary flees to the sewer with Jackie Boy's severed head but Dwight and Miho retrieve it and return to Old Town. Meanwhile, mob enforcer Manute kidnaps Gail. Becky, threatened with the death of her mother by the mob, betrays the prostitutes. Manute prepares the mob's invasion of Old Town. Dwight trades Jackie Boy's head for Gail's freedom but the head is stuffed with explosives; Dwight detonates it, destroying the evidence and Gail's captors. The other prostitutes gun down the mercenaries while Becky, injured in the fight, escapes.\n\n===\"That Yellow Bastard (Part II)\"===\nHartigan is recovering in a hospital when Senator Roark informs him that Junior is in a [[coma]] and the Roark legacy is in serious jeopardy. Hartigan will be framed for Junior's crimes; if he tells anyone the truth, they will die. A grateful Nancy promises to write letters every week while he is in prison. Hartigan goes to jail, though he refuses to confess. He receives a weekly letter from Nancy, as promised. After eight years, the letters stop and he receives a severed finger instead. Hartigan confesses to all charges leading to his parole and searches for an adult Nancy, not knowing he is being followed by a deformed, yellow man. He eventually finds her at Kadie's Bar, where she has become an [[exotic dancing|exotic dancer]].\n\nHe realizes he was set up to lead the yellow man to Nancy and the two escape in Nancy's car. Hiding in the trunk of Hartigan's car, the deformed man returns, revealing himself as Roark Junior, disfigured by years of surgery to regenerate his body parts. Junior attacks Hartigan and takes Nancy to the Roark farm to finish what he started eight years before. Hartigan follows and fakes a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], giving him a chance to kill Junior. Knowing that Senator Roark will never stop hunting them, Hartigan commits [[suicide]] to ensure Nancy's safety. Again, he justifies his life for Nancy's as a fair trade.\n\n===\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part II)\"===\nAn injured Becky departs from a hospital, talking on a cell phone with her mother. In the elevator she encounters The Salesman, dressed as a doctor. He offers her a cigarette, calling her by name, and she abruptly ends the call with her mother.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n<!-- Listed in alphabetical order, as shown in the film's opening credits.

An example of the film's neo-noir atmosphere.]]\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{See also|Shot-for-shot}}\nPrincipal photography began on March 29, 2004. Several of the scenes were shot before every actor had signed on; as a result, several stand-ins were used before the actual actors were digitally added into the film during post-production. Rodriguez, an aficionado of cinematic technology, has used similar techniques in the past. In [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the film, he recalled Rodriguez's speech during production of ''[[Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams]]'': \"This is the future! You don't wait six hours for a scene to be lighted. You want a light over here, you grab a light and put it over here. You want a nuclear submarine, you make one out of thin air and put your characters into it.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050331/REVIEWS/50322001 |title='Sin City' Review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film was noted throughout production for Rodriguez's plan to stay faithful to the source material, unlike most other comic book adaptations. Rodriguez stated that he considered the film to be \"less of an adaptation than a translation\". As a result, there is no screenwriting in the credits; simply \"Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller\". There were several minor changes, such as dialogue trimming, new colorized objects, removal of some nudity, slightly edited violence, and minor deleted scenes. These scenes were later added in the release of the ''Sin City'' Collectors DVD, which also split the books into four separate stories.<ref>{{cite web |last=Miller III |first=Randy |title=Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut, Extended, Unrated |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19223/frank-millers-sin-city-recut-extended-unrated |work=DVDTalk.com |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Sin City (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack was composed by Rodriguez, [[John Debney]], and [[Graeme Revell]]. The film's three main stories were each scored by an individual composer: Revell scored \"The Hard Goodbye\", Debney scored \"The Big Fat Kill\", and Rodriguez scored \"That Yellow Bastard\". Additionally, Rodriguez co-scored with the other two composers on several tracks.\n\nAnother notable piece of music used was the instrumental version of the song \"Cells\" by the London-based alternative group [[The Servant (band)|The Servant]]. The song was heavily featured in the film's publicity, including the promotional trailers and television spots, and being featured on the film's DVD menus.\n\n\"Sensemay\u00e1\" by [[Silvestre Revueltas]] is also used on the end sequence of \"That Yellow Bastard\". [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]]'s track \"Absurd\" is also used when Hartigan first enters Kadie's.\n\n=== Credits ===\nThree directors received credit for ''Sin City'': Miller, Rodriguez, and [[Quentin Tarantino]], the last for directing the drive-to-the-pits scene in which Dwight talks with a dead Jack Rafferty ([[Benicio del Toro]]). Miller and Rodriguez worked as a team directing the rest of the film.\n\nWhen the [[Directors Guild of America]] refused to allow two directors that were not an established team to be credited (especially since Miller had never directed before), Rodriguez first planned to give Miller full credit. Miller would not accept this. Rodriguez, also refusing to take full credit, decided to resign from the Guild so that the joint credit could remain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rodriguez Quits DGA |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/rodgriguez-quits-dga |work=ContactMusic.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on DVD on August 16, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Latchem|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7501|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511013353/http://www.hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7501|title=Dimension Confesses 'Sin'|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=May 11, 2005|date=May 9, 2005|accessdate=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception {{Anchor|Critics}} ===\nThe film opened on April 1, 2005 to generally positive reviews.

Yes, and brilliant.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Online critical reaction was particularly strong: [[James Berardinelli]] placed the film on his list of the \"Top Ten\" films of 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/sin_city.html |title=Review: Sin City |author=Berardinelli, James |work=ReelViews.net}}</ref> Chauncey Mabe of the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' wrote: \"Really, there will be no reason for anyone to make a comic-book film ever again.

William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' described it as a celebration of \"helpless people being tortured&nbsp;...I kept thinking of those clean-cut young American guards at [[Abu Ghraib]].

Scott]], identifying ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' as its chief cinematic predecessor, argued that \"Something is missing&nbsp;\u2013 something human. Don't let the movies fool you: Roger Rabbit was guilty,\" with regard to the increasing use of digitisation within films to replace the human elements. He applauds the fact Rodriguez \"has rendered a gorgeous world of silvery shadows that updates the expressionist cinematography of postwar noir\" but bemoans that several elements of \"old film noirs has been digitally broomed away\", resulting instead in a film that \"offers sensation without feeling, death without grief, sin without guilt, and, ultimately, novelty without surprise\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/movies/24scot.html?ex=1271995200&en=83f36c443f1c41eb&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work=NYTimes.com |title=The Unreal Road From Toontown to 'Sin City' |date=April 24, 2005 |author=Scott, A.

''[[The Hard Goodbye]]'' is about an ex-convict who embarks on a rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer. ''[[The Big Fat Kill]]'' follows a private investigator<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/fj5jnd/sin-city/|title=Sin City \u2013 review {{!}} cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> who gets caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police and the mob. ''[[That Yellow Bastard]]'' focuses on an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured [[serial killer]]. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story \"The Customer is Always Right\" which is collected in ''Booze, Broads & Bullets'', the sixth book in the comic series.\n\nThe film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Jessica Alba]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Elijah Wood]]. Featuring [[Alexis Bledel]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Jaime King]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Nick Stahl]], and [[Makenzie Vega]] among others.\n\n''Sin City'' opened to wide critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film's unique color processing which rendered most of the film in black and white while retaining or adding color for selected objects. The film was screened at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in competition and won the Technical Grand Prize for the film's \"visual shaping\".<ref name=\"Festival-Cannes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4278140/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Sin City |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |work=Festival-Cannes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cannes_Film_Festival/2005#Technical_Grand_Prize |title=Cannes Film Festival (2005) |work=IMDb |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228072730/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cannes_Film_Festival/2005#Technical_Grand_Prize |archivedate=December 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n===\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part I)\"===\nThe Salesman walks onto a penthouse balcony where The Customer looks out over Basin City. He offers her a cigarette and says that she looks like someone who is tired of running and that he will save her. The two share a kiss and he shoots her; she dies in his arms. He says he will never know what she was running from but that he will cash her <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE. -->check <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE. -->in the morning. <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE.-->\n\n===\"That Yellow Bastard (Part I)\"===\nOn the docks of Sin City, aging police officer [[John Hartigan]] tries to stop serial child-killer [[Roark Junior]] from raping and killing his fourth known victim, eleven-year-old [[Nancy Callahan]]. Junior is the son of [[Roark family#Senator Roark|Senator Roark]], who has bribed the police to cover up his son's crimes. Hartigan's corrupt partner, Bob tries to convince Hartigan to walk away; Hartigan knocks him out.\n\nHartigan, experiencing pain from a [[Angina pectoris|bad heart]], heads into the warehouse where Roark Junior and several henchmen are holding Nancy. Junior shoots Hartigan in the shoulder and tries to escape. Hartigan catches up and shoots off Junior's ear, hand and genitals. Bob, now recovered, shoots Hartigan in the back. As the sirens approach, Bob leaves and Nancy lies down in Hartigan's lap. Hartigan passes out, reasoning his death is a fair trade for the girl's life.\n\n===\"The Hard Goodbye\"===\nAfter a [[one-night stand]], [[Marv (Sin City)|Marv]] awakens to find [[Goldie and Wendy|Goldie]] has been killed while he slept. He flees the frame-up as the police arrive, vowing to avenge her death. His [[parole officer]], Lucille, warns him to give up on this mission, believing Marv may have imagined it all due to his \"condition\". Marv interrogates several informants, working up to a corrupt priest, who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. Marv kills the priest but is then attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie, which he dismisses as a hallucination.\n\nMarv goes to the Roark family farm and is subdued by the silent stalker who killed Goldie. He awakens in the basement to find Lucille has been captured after looking into his story. She tells Marv that the killer is a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] and that Goldie was a prostitute. He learns that the killer's name is Kevin and escapes. Lucille is shot by the leader of a squad of corrupt cops. Marv kills the cops except for their leader, whom he interrogates. He learns that Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie's murder.\n\nMarv goes to Old Town, Sin City's prostitute-run [[red-light district]], to learn more about Goldie and is captured by her twin sister, [[Goldie and Wendy|Wendy]], the attacker Marv previously dismissed as a hallucination. Once he convinces Wendy that he is not the killer, the two return to the farm where Marv kills Kevin. He confronts Cardinal Roark, who confesses his part in the murders. Kevin was the cardinal's ward; the two men ate the prostitutes to \"consume their souls\". Marv kills the cardinal but is then shot and captured by his guards.\n\nMarv is taken to a hospital where cops threaten to kill his mother, to get him to confess to killing Roark, Kevin and their victims. He is [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in the [[electric chair]]. Wendy visits him on [[death row]] and thanks him for avenging her sister. Marv is then executed.\n\n===\"The Big Fat Kill\"===\nShellie is being harassed by her [[domestic violence|abusive]] ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy and his cronies. Her boyfriend, Dwight violently warns him to leave Shellie alone. Jackie Boy and his cronies flee to Old Town. Dwight follows and sees them harass Becky, a young prostitute. Gail, the prostitutes' leader and Dwight's on-and-off lover, also witnesses the scene. When Jackie Boy threatens Becky with a gun, [[Miho (Sin City)|Miho]], a martial arts expert, kills Jackie Boy and his friends. They realize Jackie Boy is actually Detective Lieutenant [[Jack Rafferty]] of the Basin City Police, considered a \"hero cop\" by the press. If the cops learn how he died, their truce with the prostitutes would end and the mob would be free to wage war on Old Town.\n\nDwight takes the bodies to a [[tar pit]], where he is attacked by an ex-[[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] mercenary hired by mob boss Wallenquist. He nearly drowns in the tar before Miho saves him. The mercenary flees to the sewer with Jackie Boy's severed head but Dwight and Miho retrieve it and return to Old Town. Meanwhile, mob enforcer Manute kidnaps Gail. Becky, threatened with the death of her mother by the mob, betrays the prostitutes. Manute prepares the mob's invasion of Old Town. Dwight trades Jackie Boy\u2019s head for Gail's freedom but the head is stuffed with explosives; Dwight detonates it, destroying the evidence and Gail's captors. The other prostitutes gun down the mercenaries while Becky, injured in the fight, escapes.\n\n===\"That Yellow Bastard (Part II)\"===\nHartigan is recovering in a hospital when Senator Roark informs him that Junior is in a [[coma]] and the Roark legacy is in serious jeopardy. Hartigan will be framed for Junior's crimes; if he tells anyone the truth, they will die. A grateful Nancy promises to write letters every week while he is in prison. Hartigan goes to jail, though he refuses to confess. He receives a weekly letter from Nancy, as promised. After eight years, the letters stop and he receives a severed finger instead. Hartigan confesses to all charges leading to his parole and searches for an adult Nancy, not knowing he is being followed by a deformed, yellow man. He eventually finds her at Kadie's Bar, where she has become an [[exotic dancing|exotic dancer]].\n\nHe realizes he was set up to lead the yellow man to Nancy and the two escape in Nancy's car. Hiding in the trunk of Hartigan's car, the deformed man returns, revealing himself as Roark Junior, disfigured by years of surgery to regenerate his body parts. Junior attacks Hartigan and takes Nancy to the Roark farm to finish what he started eight years before. Hartigan follows and fakes a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], giving him a chance to kill Junior. Knowing that Senator Roark will never stop hunting them, Hartigan commits [[suicide]] to ensure Nancy's safety. Again, he justifies his life for Nancy's as a fair trade.\n\n===\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part II)\"===\nAn injured Becky departs from a hospital, talking on a cell phone with her mother. In the elevator she encounters The Salesman, dressed as a doctor. He offers her a cigarette, calling her by name, and she abruptly ends the call with her mother.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n<!-- Listed in alphabetical order, as shown in the film's opening credits.

An example of the film's neo-noir atmosphere.]]\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{See also|Shot-for-shot}}\nPrincipal photography began on March 29, 2004. Several of the scenes were shot before every actor had signed on; as a result, several stand-ins were used before the actual actors were digitally added into the film during post-production. Rodriguez, an aficionado of cinematic technology, has used similar techniques in the past. In [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the film, he recalled Rodriguez's speech during production of ''[[Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams]]'': \"This is the future! You don't wait six hours for a scene to be lighted. You want a light over here, you grab a light and put it over here. You want a nuclear submarine, you make one out of thin air and put your characters into it.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050331/REVIEWS/50322001 |title='Sin City' Review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film was noted throughout production for Rodriguez's plan to stay faithful to the source material, unlike most other comic book adaptations. Rodriguez stated that he considered the film to be \"less of an adaptation than a translation\". As a result, there is no screenwriting in the credits; simply \"Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller\". There were several minor changes, such as dialogue trimming, new colorized objects, removal of some nudity, slightly edited violence, and minor deleted scenes. These scenes were later added in the release of the ''Sin City'' Collectors DVD, which also split the books into four separate stories.<ref>{{cite web |last=Miller III |first=Randy |title=Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut, Extended, Unrated |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19223/frank-millers-sin-city-recut-extended-unrated |work=DVDTalk.com |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Sin City (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack was composed by Rodriguez, [[John Debney]], and [[Graeme Revell]]. The film's three main stories were each scored by an individual composer: Revell scored \"The Hard Goodbye\", Debney scored \"The Big Fat Kill\", and Rodriguez scored \"That Yellow Bastard\". Additionally, Rodriguez co-scored with the other two composers on several tracks.\n\nAnother notable piece of music used was the instrumental version of the song \"Cells\" by the London-based alternative group [[The Servant (band)|The Servant]]. The song was heavily featured in the film's publicity, including the promotional trailers and television spots, and being featured on the film's DVD menus.\n\n\"Sensemay\u00e1\" by [[Silvestre Revueltas]] is also used on the end sequence of \"That Yellow Bastard\". [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]]'s track \"Absurd\" is also used when Hartigan first enters Kadie's.\n\n=== Credits ===\nThree directors received credit for ''Sin City'': Miller, Rodriguez, and [[Quentin Tarantino]], the last for directing the drive-to-the-pits scene in which Dwight talks with a dead Jack Rafferty ([[Benicio del Toro]]). Miller and Rodriguez worked as a team directing the rest of the film.\n\nWhen the [[Directors Guild of America]] refused to allow two directors that were not an established team to be credited (especially since Miller had never directed before), Rodriguez first planned to give Miller full credit. Miller would not accept this. Rodriguez, also refusing to take full credit, decided to resign from the Guild so that the joint credit could remain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rodriguez Quits DGA |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/rodgriguez-quits-dga |work=ContactMusic.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on DVD on August 16, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Latchem|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7501|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511013353/http://www.hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7501|title=Dimension Confesses 'Sin'|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=May 11, 2005|date=May 9, 2005|accessdate=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception {{Anchor|Critics}} ===\nThe film opened on April 1, 2005 to generally positive reviews.

William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' described it as a celebration of \"helpless people being tortured&nbsp;...I kept thinking of those clean-cut young American guards at [[Abu Ghraib]].

Scott]], identifying ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' as its chief cinematic predecessor, argued that \"Something is missing&nbsp;\u2013 something human. Don't let the movies fool you: Roger Rabbit was guilty,\" with regard to the increasing use of digitisation within films to replace the human elements. He applauds the fact Rodriguez \"has rendered a gorgeous world of silvery shadows that updates the expressionist cinematography of postwar noir\" but bemoans that several elements of \"old film noirs has been digitally broomed away\", resulting instead in a film that \"offers sensation without feeling, death without grief, sin without guilt, and, ultimately, novelty without surprise\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/movies/24scot.html?ex=1271995200&en=83f36c443f1c41eb&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work=NYTimes.com |title=The Unreal Road From Toontown to 'Sin City' |date=April 24, 2005 |author=Scott, A.

The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected metal.   For structures such as long [[pipeline transport|pipelines]],  where passive galvanic cathodic protection is not adequate, an external DC electrical power source is used to provide sufficient current.\n\nCathodic protection systems protect a wide range of metallic structures in various environments. Common applications are: [[steel]] water or fuel pipelines and steel [[storage tank]]s such as home [[water heating|water heaters]]; steel pier [[Deep foundation|piles]]; ship and boat hulls; offshore [[oil platform]]s and onshore [[oil well]] casings; [[offshore wind farm]] foundations and metal reinforcement bars in concrete buildings and structures.  Another common application is in [[galvanization|galvanized steel]], in which a sacrificial coating of [[zinc]] on steel parts protects them from rust.\n\nCathodic protection can, in some cases, prevent [[stress corrosion cracking]].\n\n==History==\nCathodic protection was first described by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in a series of papers presented to the [[Royal Society]]<ref>Davy, cited in Ashworth 1994</ref> in London in 1824. The first application was to {{HMS|Samarang|1822|6}} <ref>Ashworth, 10:3</ref> in 1824. [[Sacrificial anode]]s made from [[iron]] attached to the [[Copper sheathing|copper sheath]] of the hull below the waterline dramatically reduced the corrosion rate of the [[copper]]. However, a side effect of cathodic protection was the increase in [[marine growth]]. Usually, copper when corroding releases copper ions which have an [[anti-fouling]] effect. Since excess marine growth affected the performance of the ship, the [[Royal Navy]] decided that it was better to allow the copper to corrode and have the benefit of reduced marine growth, so cathodic protection was not used further.\n\nDavy was assisted in his experiments by his pupil [[Michael Faraday]], who continued his research after Davy's death. In 1834, Faraday discovered the quantitative connection between corrosion weight loss and electric current and thus laid the foundation for the future application of cathodic protection.<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.12</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Edison]] experimented with impressed current cathodic protection on ships in 1890, but was unsuccessful due to the lack of a suitable current source and anode materials. It would be 100 years after Davy's experiment before cathodic protection was used widely on oil pipelines in the United States<ref>Scherer, 38(27), 179 cited in Baeckman</ref> {{mdash}} cathodic protection was applied to steel gas pipelines beginning in 1928<ref>Robert J. Kuhn, Cathodic Protection of Underground Pipe Lines from Soil Corrosion, [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] Proceedings, Nov. 1933, Vol. 14, p157</ref> and more widely in the 1930s.<ref>Natural Resources Canada Retrieved 23 JAN 2012([http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/minerals-metals/materials-technology/picon/3149]) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106080642/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/minerals-metals/materials-technology/picon/3149 |date=January 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Sacrificial anode.jpg|thumb|Galvanic [[sacrificial anode]] attached to the hull of a ship, showing corrosion.]]\n\n===Galvanic===\nIn the application of ''passive'' cathodic protection, a ''[[galvanic anode]]'', a piece of a more electrochemically \"active\" metal (more negative [[electrode potential]]), is attached to the vulnerable metal surface where it is exposed to an electrolyte.  Galvanic anodes are selected because they have a more \"active\" voltage than the metal of the target structure (typically steel). \n\nConcrete has a pH around 13. In this environment the steel reinforcement has a passive protective layer and remains largely stable. Galvanic systems are \"constant potential\" systems that aim to restore the concrete's natural protective environment by providing a high initial current to restore passivity. It then reverts to a lower sacrificial current while harmful negative Chloride ions migrate away from the steel and towards the positive anode. The anodes remain reactive through their lifetime (10-20 years typically) increasing current when the resistivity decreases due to corrosion hazards such as rainfall, temperature increases or flooding. The reactive nature of these anodes makes them an efficient choice.\n\nUnlike ICCP systems steel constant polarization is not the goal, rather the restoration of the environment. Polarization of the target structure is caused by the electron flow from the anode to the cathode, so the two metals must have a good [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] contact. The driving force for the cathodic protection current is the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode.<ref>Roberge p.871</ref> During the initial phase of high current, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative protecting the steel which hydroxide ion generation at the steel surface and ionic migration restore the concrete environment. \n\nOver time the galvanic anode continues to corrode, consuming the anode material until eventually it must be replaced.<br> \n\nGalvanic or sacrificial anodes are made in various shapes and sizes using [[alloy]]s of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]]. [[ASTM International]] publishes standards on the composition and manufacturing of galvanic anodes.<ref>ASTM B418-16 Standard Specification for Cast and Wrought Galvanic Zinc Anodes</ref><ref>ASTM B843-13 Standard Specification for Magnesium Alloy Anodes for Cathodic Protection</ref><ref>ASTM F1182-07(2013) Standard Specification for Anodes, Sacrificial Zinc Alloy</ref>\n\nIn order for galvanic cathodic protection to work, the anode must possess a lower (that is, more negative) electrode potential than that of the cathode (the target structure to be protected). The table below shows a simplified [[galvanic series]] which is used to select the anode metal.<ref>Peabody p.304</ref>  The anode must be chosen from a material that is lower on the list than the material to be protected.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Metal\n!Potential with respect to a Cu:CuSO<sub>4</sub>\nreference electrode in neutral pH environment (volts)\n|-\n| Carbon, Graphite, Coke\n| +0.3\n|-\n| Platinum\n| 0 to \u22120.1\n|-\n| Mill scale on Steel\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| High Silicon Cast Iron\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| Copper, brass, bronze\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| Mild steel in concrete\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| Lead\n| \u22120.5\n|-\n| Cast iron (not graphitized)\n| \u22120.5\n|-\n| Mild steel (rusted)\n| \u22120.2 to \u22120.5\n|-\n| Mild steel (clean)\n| \u22120.5 to \u22120.8\n|-\n| Commercially pure aluminium\n| \u22120.8\n|-\n| Aluminium alloy (5% zinc)\n| \u22121.05\n|-\n| Zinc\n| \u22121.1\n|-\n| Magnesium Alloy (6% Al, 3% Zn, 0.15% Mn)\n| \u22121.6\n|-\n| Commercially Pure Magnesium\n| \u22121.75\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|ICCP}}Impressed current systems===\n[[File:Cathodic Protection diagram.svg|thumb|Simple impressed current cathodic protection system. A source of [[direct current|DC]] electric current is used to help drive the protective electrochemical reaction.]]\n\nIn some cases, ''impressed current cathodic protection'' (ICCP) systems are used. These consist of anodes connected to a DC power source, often a transformer-rectifier connected to AC power. In the absence of an AC supply, alternative power sources may be used, such as solar panels, wind power or gas powered thermoelectric generators.<ref>Ashworth 10:10</ref><ref>Roberge p.880</ref>\n\nAnodes for ICCP systems are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Common anodes are tubular and solid rod shapes or continuous ribbons of various materials. These include high [[silicon]] [[cast iron]], [[graphite]], [[mixed metal oxide]] (MMO), [[platinum]] and [[niobium]] coated wire and other materials.\n\nFor pipelines, anodes are arranged in groundbeds either distributed or in a deep vertical hole depending on several design and field condition factors including current distribution requirements.\n\nCathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are often custom manufactured and equipped with a variety of features, including remote monitoring and control, integral current interrupters and various type of electrical [[Enclosure (electrical)|enclosure]]s. The output DC negative terminal is connected to the structure to be protected by the cathodic protection system.<ref>Peabody p.158</ref> The rectifier output DC positive cable is connected to the [[anode]]s. The AC power cable is connected to the rectifier input terminals.\n\nThe output of the ICCP system should be optimised to provide enough current to provide protection to the target structure.  Some cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are designed with taps on the [[transformer]] windings and jumper terminals to select the voltage output of the ICCP system. Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units for water tanks and used in other applications are made with [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] circuits to automatically adjust the operating voltage to maintain the optimum current output or structure-to-electrolyte [[potential]].<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.233</ref> [[analog circuit|Analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]] meters are often installed to show the operating voltage (DC and sometime AC) and current output.  For shore structures and other large complex target structures, ICCP systems are often designed with multiple independent zones of anodes with separate cathodic protection transformer-rectifier circuits.\n\n===Hybrid Systems===\nHybrid systems have been used for over a decade and incorporate the coordination, monitoring and high restorative current flow of ICCP systems with the reactive, lower cost and easier to maintain galvanic anodes.\n\nThe system is made up of wired galvanic anodes in arrays typically 400mm apart which are then initially powered for a short period to restore the concrete and power ionic migration. The power supply is then taken away and the anodes simply attached to the steel as a galvanic system. More powered phases can be administered if needed. Like Galvanic systems corrosion rate monitoring from polarisation tests and half-cell potential mapping can be used to measure corrosion. Polarization is not the goal for the life of the system.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Hot Water Tank / Water Heater===\nThis technology is also used to protect [[Water-heater|water heaters]]. Indeed, the electrons sent by the imposed current anode (composed of [[titanium]] and covered with MMO) prevents the inside of the tank from rusting.\n\nIn order to be recognized as effective, these anodes must comply with certain standards: A cathodic protection system is considered efficient when its potential reaches or exceeds the limits established by the cathodic protection criteria. The cathode protection criteria used come from the standard NACE SP0388-2007 (formerly RP0388-2001) of the NACE National Association of Corrosion Engineers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cathodic Protection Industry - NACE |url=https://www.nace.org/resources/industries-nace-serves/cathodic-protection-industry |website=www.nace.org |accessdate=24 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Pipelines===\n[[File:Cathodic Protection Rectifier.JPG|thumb|An air cooled cathodic protection rectifier connected to a pipeline.]]\n[[File:Gas Mains cathodic protection markers, Wellington Street, Leeds (12th April 2014).JPG|thumb|right|Cathodic protection markers over a gas pipeline in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].]]\n\nHazardous product [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are routinely protected by a coating supplemented with cathodic protection. An impressed current cathodic protection system (ICCP) for a pipeline consists of a DC power source, often an AC powered transformer rectifier and an anode, or array of anodes buried in the ground (the anode [[groundbed]]).\n\nThe DC power source would typically have a DC output of up to 50 [[ampere]]s and 50 [[volt]]s, but this depends on several factors, such as the size of the pipeline and coating quality. The positive DC output terminal would be connected via [[Electrical cable|cables]] to the anode array, while another cable would connect the negative terminal of the rectifier to the pipeline, preferably through junction boxes to allow measurements to be taken.<ref>Peabody p.22</ref>\n\nAnodes can be installed in a groundbed consisting of a vertical hole backfilled with conductive [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (a material that improves the performance and life of the anodes) or laid in a prepared trench, surrounded by conductive coke and backfilled. The choice of groundbed type and size depends on the application, location and soil resistivity.<ref>Peabody p.132</ref>\n\nThe DC cathodic protection current is then adjusted to the optimum level after conducting various tests including measurements of pipe-to-soil potentials or [[electrode potential]].\n\nIt is sometimes more economically viable to protect a pipeline using galvanic (sacrificial) anodes. This is often the case on smaller diameter pipelines of limited length.<ref>Peabody p.32</ref>  Galvanic anodes rely on the [[galvanic series]] potentials of the metals to drive cathodic protection current from the anode to the structure being protected.\n\nWater pipelines of various pipe materials are also provided with cathodic protection where owners determine the cost is reasonable for the expected pipeline [[service life]] extension attributed to the application of cathodic protection.\n\n===Ships and boats===\n[[File:Ship-propeller.jpg|thumb|The white patches visible on the ship's hull are zinc block sacrificial anodes.]]\n\nCathodic protection on [[ship]]s is often implemented by galvanic anodes attached to the hull and ICCP for larger vessels. Since ships are regularly removed from the water for inspections and maintenance, it is a simple task to replace the galvanic anodes.<ref>BS 7361-1:1991 Sect. 6.2</ref>\n\nGalvanic anodes are generally shaped to reduced drag in the water and fitted flush to the hull to also try to minimize drag.<ref>BS 7361-1:1991 Sect. 6.2.1.2</ref>\n\nSmaller vessels, with non-metallic hulls, such as [[yacht]]s, are equipped with galvanic anodes to protect areas such as [[outboard motor]]s.  As with all galvanic cathodic protection, this application relies on a solid electrical connection between the anode and the item to be protected.\n\nFor ICCP on ships, the anodes are usually constructed of a relatively inert material such as platinised titanium. A DC power supply is provided within the ship and the anodes mounted on the outside of the hull. The anode cables are introduced into the ship via a [[compression seal fitting]] and routed to the DC power source. The negative cable from the power supply is simply attached to the hull to complete the circuit.  Ship ICCP anodes are flush-mounted, minimizing the effects of drag on the ship, and located a minimum 5&nbsp;ft below the light [[waterline|load line]]<ref>CP-2 Cathodic Protection Technician-Maritime Student Manual NACE International, July 2009, pg 3-11</ref> in an area to avoid mechanical damage.  The current density required for protection is a function of velocity and considered when selecting the current capacity and location of anode placement on the hull.\n\nSome ships may require specialist treatment, for example aluminium hulls with steel fixtures will create an electrochemical cell where the aluminium hull can act as a galvanic anode and corrosion is enhanced. In cases like this, aluminium or zinc galvanic anodes can be used to offset the potential difference between the aluminium hull and the steel fixture.<ref>EN 12473:2000 Sect. 8.3.1</ref> If the steel fixtures are large, several galvanic anodes may be required, or even a small ICCP system.\n\n===Marine===\nMarine cathodic protection covers many areas, [[jetty|jetties]], [[harbor]]s, [[offshore construction|offshore]] structures. The variety of different types of structure leads to a variety of systems to provide protection. Galvanic anodes are favored,<ref>Roberge p.876</ref> but ICCP can also often be used.  Because of the wide variety of structure geometry, composition, and architecture, specialized firms are often required to engineer structure-specific cathodic protection systems. Sometimes marine structures require retroactive modification to be effectively protected <ref>Britton p.1</ref>\n\n===Steel in concrete===\nThe application to [[concrete]] [[rebar|reinforcement]] is slightly different in that the anodes and reference electrodes are usually embedded in the concrete at the time of construction when the concrete is being poured.  The usual technique for concrete buildings, bridges and similar structures is to use ICCP,<ref>Ashworth et al 10:82</ref> but there are systems available that use the principle of galvanic cathodic protection as well,<ref>Covino et al/</ref><ref>Daily</ref><ref>Highways Agency Sect. 4.8</ref> although in the UK at least, the use of galvanic anodes for atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete structures is considered experimental.<ref>Highways Agency Sect. 2.1</ref>\n\nFor ICCP, the principle is the same as any other ICCP system. However, in a typical atmospherically exposed concrete structure such as a bridge, there will be many more anodes distributed through the structure as opposed to an array of anodes as used on a pipeline. This makes for a more complicated system and usually an automatically controlled DC power source is used, possibly with an option for remote monitoring and operation.<ref>Highways Agency Sect. 4.5</ref> For buried or submerged structures, the treatment is similar to that of any other buried or submerged structure.\n\nGalvanic systems offer the advantage of being easier to retrofit and do not need any control systems as ICCP does.\n\nFor pipelines constructed from [[pre-stressed concrete]] cylinder pipe (PCCP), the techniques used for cathodic protection are generally as for steel pipelines except that the applied potential must be limited to prevent damage to the prestressing wire.<ref>NACE RP0100-2000 Sect. 5.2.5</ref>\n\nThe steel wire in a PCCP pipeline is stressed to the point that any corrosion of the wire can result in failure. An additional problem is that any excessive hydrogen ions as a result of an excessively negative potential can cause hydrogen embrittlement of the wire, also resulting in failure. The failure of too many wires will result in catastrophic failure of the PCCP.<ref>Gummow</ref> To implement ICCP therefore requires very careful control to ensure satisfactory protection. A simpler option is to use galvanic anodes, which are self-limiting and need no control.<ref>NACE RP0100-2000 Sect. 5.4</ref>\n\n===Internal cathodic protection===\nVessels, pipelines and tanks which are used to store or transport liquids can also be protected from corrosion on their internal surfaces by the use of cathodic protection.<ref>EN 12499:2003</ref> ICCP and galvanic systems can be used.<ref>Ashworth et al 10:112</ref> A common application of internal cathodic protection is water storage tanks and [[Power station|power plant]] [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s.\n\n===Galvanized steel===\n[[Galvanizing]] generally refers to [[hot-dip galvanizing]] which is a way of coating steel with a layer of metallic zinc or tin. Galvanized coatings are quite durable in most environments because they combine the barrier properties of a [[coating]] with some of the benefits of cathodic protection. If the zinc coating is scratched or otherwise locally damaged and steel is exposed, the surrounding areas of zinc coating form a galvanic cell with the exposed steel and protect it from corrosion. This is a form of localized cathodic protection - the zinc acts as a sacrificial anode.\n\nGalvanizing, while using the electrochemical principle of cathodic protection, is not actually cathodic protection. Cathodic protection requires the anode to be separate from the metal surface to be protected, with an ionic connection through the electrolyte and an electron connection through a connecting cable, bolt or similar. This means that any area of the protected structure within the electrolyte can be protected, whereas in the case of galvanizing, only areas very close to the zinc are protected. Hence, a larger area of bare steel would only be protected around the edges.\n\n===Automobiles===\nSeveral companies market electronic devices claiming to mitigate corrosion for automobiles and trucks.<ref>[http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/counteract-electronic-rust-protection-system-0477905p.html CounterAct at Canadian Tire retailer]</ref> Corrosion control professionals find they do not work.<ref>[http://www.nace.org/StarterApps/Wiki/Dynamic.aspx?id=367&__taxonomyid=225 NACE International Article Electronic Rust Prevention]</ref>  There is no peer reviewed scientific testing and validation supporting the use of the devices. In 1996 the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] ordered David McCready, a person that sold devices claiming to protect cars from corrosion, to pay restitution and banned the names \"Rust Buster\" and \"Rust Evader.\"<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1996/07/rust-evader-inventor-settles-ftc-charges Federal Trade Commission Press Release]</ref>\n\n==Testing==\n\n[[Electrode potential]] is measured with [[reference electrode]]s. [[Copper-copper(II) sulfate electrode|Copper-copper sulphate electrode]]s are used for structures in contact with [[soil]] or fresh water.  [[Silver chloride electrode|Silver/silver chloride/seawater electrodes]] or pure [[zinc]] electrodes are used for [[seawater]] applications. The methods are described in EN 13509:2003 and NACE TM0497 along with the sources of error<ref>NACE TM0497 Section 5.8</ref> in the voltage that appears on the display of the meter. Interpretation of electrode potential measurements to determine the potential at the interface between the anode of the corrosion cell and the electrolyte requires training<ref>NACE TM0497 Section 1.2</ref> and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of measurements done in laboratory work.\n\n==Problems==\n\n===Production of hydrogen===\nA side effect of improperly applied cathodic protection is the production of atomic [[hydrogen]],<ref>{{Google books|baHwfLpWpP8C|Fundamentals of Electrochemical Corrosion|page=174}}</ref> leading to its absorption in the protected metal and subsequent [[hydrogen embrittlement]] of welds and materials with high hardness.  Under normal conditions, the atomic hydrogen will combine at the metal surface to create hydrogen gas, which cannot penetrate the metal.  Hydrogen atoms, however, are small enough to pass through the crystalline steel structure, and lead in some cases to hydrogen embrittlement.\n\n===Cathodic disbonding===\nThis is a process of disbondment of protective coatings from the protected structure (cathode) due to the formation of hydrogen ions over the surface of the protected material (cathode).<ref>Roberge Sect. 11.4.1, p.886</ref> Disbonding can be exacerbated by an increase in alkali ions and an increase in cathodic polarization.<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.167</ref> The degree of disbonding is also reliant on the type of coating, with some coatings affected more than others.<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.168</ref> Cathodic protection systems should be operated so that the structure does not become excessively polarized,<ref>Peabody p.37</ref> since this also promotes disbonding due to excessively negative potentials. Cathodic disbonding occurs rapidly in pipelines that contain hot fluids because the process is accelerated by heat flow.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Cathodic shielding===\nEffectiveness of cathodic protection (CP) systems on steel pipelines can be impaired by the use of solid film backed dielectric coatings such as polyethylene tapes, shrinkable pipeline sleeves, and factory applied single or multiple solid film coatings.  This phenomenon occurs because of the high electrical resistivity of these film backings.<ref>NACE International Paper 09043</ref>  Protective electric current from the cathodic protection system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film backing.  Cathodic shielding was first defined in the 1980s as being a problem, and technical papers on the subject have been regularly published since then.\n\nA 1999 report<ref>Transportation Safety Board of Canada</ref> concerning a {{convert|20600|oilbbl|abbr=on}} spill from a [[Saskatchewan]] [[crude oil]] line contains an excellent definition of the cathodic shielding problem:\n\n:\"The triple situation of disbondment of the (corrosion) coating, the dielectric nature of the coating and the unique electrochemical environment established under the exterior coating, which acts as a shield to the electrical CP current, is referred to as CP shielding.  The combination of tenting and disbondment permits a corrosive environment around the outside of the pipe to enter into the void between the exterior coating and the pipe surface.  With the development of this CP shielding phenomenon, impressed current from the CP system cannot access exposed metal under the exterior coating to protect the pipe surface from the consequences of an aggressive corrosive environment.  The CP shielding phenomenon induces changes in the potential gradient of the CP system across the exterior coating, which are further pronounced in areas of insufficient or sub-standard CP current emanating from the pipeline's CP system.  This produces an area on the pipeline of insufficient CP defense against metal loss aggravated by an exterior corrosive environment.\"\n\nCathodic shielding is referenced in a number of the standards listed below.  Newly issued USDOT regulation Title 49 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title49-vol3/pdf/CFR-2009-title49-vol3-sec192-112.pdf 192.112], in the section for ''Additional design requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure'' requires that \"The pipe must be protected against external corrosion by a non-shielding coating\" (see coatings section on standard).  Also, the NACE SP0169:2007 standard defines shielding in section 2, cautions against the use of materials that create electrical shielding in section 4.2.3, cautions against use of external coatings that create electrical shielding in section 5.1.2.3, and instructs readers to take 'appropriate action' when the effects of electrical shielding of cathodic protection current are detected on an operating pipeline in section 10.9.\n\n==Standards==\n* 49 CFR 192.451 - Requirements for Corrosion Control - Transportation of natural and other gas by pipeline: US minimum federal safety standards\n* 49 CFR 195.551 - Requirements for Corrosion Control - Transportation of hazardous liquids by pipelines: US minimum federal safety standards \n* AS 2832 - Australian Standards for Cathodic Protection\n* ASME B31Q 0001-0191\n* ASTM G 8, G 42 - Evaluating Cathodic Disbondment resistance of coatings\n* DNV-RP-B401 - Cathodic Protection Design - Det Norske Veritas\n* EN 12068:1999 - Cathodic protection.

The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected metal.   For structures such as long [[pipeline transport|pipelines]],  where passive galvanic cathodic protection is not adequate, an external DC electrical power source is used to provide sufficient current.\n\nCathodic protection systems protect a wide range of metallic structures in various environments. Common applications are: [[steel]] water or fuel pipelines and steel [[storage tank]]s such as home [[water heater]]s; steel pier [[Deep foundation|piles]]; ship and boat hulls; offshore [[oil platform]]s and onshore [[oil well]] casings; [[offshore wind farm]] foundations and metal reinforcement bars in concrete buildings and structures.  Another common application is in [[galvanization|galvanized steel]], in which a sacrificial coating of [[zinc]] on steel parts protects them from rust.\n\nCathodic protection can, in some cases, prevent [[stress corrosion cracking]].\n\n==History==\nCathodic protection was first described by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in a series of papers presented to the [[Royal Society]]<ref>Davy, cited in Ashworth 1994</ref> in London in 1824. The first application was to {{HMS|Samarang|1822|6}} <ref>Ashworth, 10:3</ref> in 1824. [[Sacrificial anode]]s made from [[iron]] attached to the [[Copper sheathing|copper sheath]] of the hull below the waterline dramatically reduced the corrosion rate of the [[copper]]. However, a side effect of cathodic protection was the increase in [[marine growth]]. Usually, copper when corroding releases copper ions which have an [[anti-fouling]] effect. Since excess marine growth affected the performance of the ship, the [[Royal Navy]] decided that it was better to allow the copper to corrode and have the benefit of reduced marine growth, so cathodic protection was not used further.\n\nDavy was assisted in his experiments by his pupil [[Michael Faraday]], who continued his research after Davy's death. In 1834, Faraday discovered the quantitative connection between corrosion weight loss and electric current and thus laid the foundation for the future application of cathodic protection.<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.12</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Edison]] experimented with impressed current cathodic protection on ships in 1890, but was unsuccessful due to the lack of a suitable current source and anode materials. It would be 100 years after Davy's experiment before cathodic protection was used widely on oil pipelines in the United States<ref>Scherer, 38(27), 179 cited in Baeckman</ref> {{mdash}} cathodic protection was applied to steel gas pipelines beginning in 1928<ref>Robert J.

Galvanic anodes are selected because they have a more \"active\" voltage than the metal of the target structure (typically steel). \n\nConcrete has a pH around 13. In this environment the steel reinforcement has a passive protective layer and remains largely stable. Galvanic systems are \"constant potential\" systems that aim to restore the concrete's natural protective environment by providing a high initial current to restore passivity. It then reverts to a lower sacrificial current while harmful negative Chloride ions migrate away from the steel and towards the positive anode. The anodes remain reactive through their lifetime (10-20 years typically) increasing current when the resistivity decreases due to corrosion hazards such as rainfall, temperature increases or flooding. The reactive nature of these anodes makes them an efficient choice.\n\nUnlike ICCP systems steel constant polarization is not the goal, rather the restoration of the environment. Polarization of the target structure is caused by the electron flow from the anode to the cathode, so the two metals must have a good [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] contact. The driving force for the cathodic protection current is the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode.<ref>Roberge p.871</ref> During the initial phase of high current, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative protecting the steel which hydroxide ion generation at the steel surface and ionic migration restore the concrete environment. \n\nOver time the galvanic anode continues to corrode, consuming the anode material until eventually it must be replaced.<br> \n\nGalvanic or sacrificial anodes are made in various shapes and sizes using [[alloy]]s of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]]. [[ASTM International]] publishes standards on the composition and manufacturing of galvanic anodes.<ref>ASTM B418-16 Standard Specification for Cast and Wrought Galvanic Zinc Anodes</ref><ref>ASTM B843-13 Standard Specification for Magnesium Alloy Anodes for Cathodic Protection</ref><ref>ASTM F1182-07(2013) Standard Specification for Anodes, Sacrificial Zinc Alloy</ref>\n\nIn order for galvanic cathodic protection to work, the anode must possess a lower (that is, more negative) electrode potential than that of the cathode (the target structure to be protected). The table below shows a simplified [[galvanic series]] which is used to select the anode metal.<ref>Peabody p.304</ref>  The anode must be chosen from a material that is lower on the list than the material to be protected.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Metal\n!Potential with respect to a Cu:CuSO<sub>4</sub>\nreference electrode in neutral pH environment (volts)\n|-\n| Carbon, Graphite, Coke\n| +0.3\n|-\n| Platinum\n| 0 to \u22120.1\n|-\n| Mill scale on Steel\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| High Silicon Cast Iron\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| Copper, brass, bronze\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| Mild steel in concrete\n| \u22120.2\n|-\n| Lead\n| \u22120.5\n|-\n| Cast iron (not graphitized)\n| \u22120.5\n|-\n| Mild steel (rusted)\n| \u22120.2 to \u22120.5\n|-\n| Mild steel (clean)\n| \u22120.5 to \u22120.8\n|-\n| Commercially pure aluminium\n| \u22120.8\n|-\n| Aluminium alloy (5% zinc)\n| \u22121.05\n|-\n| Zinc\n| \u22121.1\n|-\n| Magnesium Alloy (6% Al, 3% Zn, 0.15% Mn)\n| \u22121.6\n|-\n| Commercially Pure Magnesium\n| \u22121.75\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|ICCP}}Impressed current systems===\n[[File:Cathodic Protection diagram.svg|thumb|Simple impressed current cathodic protection system. A source of [[direct current|DC]] electric current is used to help drive the protective electrochemical reaction.]]\n\nIn some cases, ''impressed current cathodic protection'' (ICCP) systems are used. These consist of anodes connected to a DC power source, often a transformer-rectifier connected to AC power. In the absence of an AC supply, alternative power sources may be used, such as solar panels, wind power or gas powered thermoelectric generators.<ref>Ashworth 10:10</ref><ref>Roberge p.880</ref>\n\nAnodes for ICCP systems are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Common anodes are tubular and solid rod shapes or continuous ribbons of various materials. These include high [[silicon]] [[cast iron]], [[graphite]], [[mixed metal oxide]] (MMO), [[platinum]] and [[niobium]] coated wire and other materials.\n\nFor pipelines, anodes are arranged in groundbeds either distributed or in a deep vertical hole depending on several design and field condition factors including current distribution requirements.\n\nCathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are often custom manufactured and equipped with a variety of features, including remote monitoring and control, integral current interrupters and various type of electrical [[Enclosure (electrical)|enclosure]]s. The output DC negative terminal is connected to the structure to be protected by the cathodic protection system.<ref>Peabody p.158</ref> The rectifier output DC positive cable is connected to the [[anode]]s. The AC power cable is connected to the rectifier input terminals.\n\nThe output of the ICCP system should be optimised to provide enough current to provide protection to the target structure.  Some cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are designed with taps on the [[transformer]] windings and jumper terminals to select the voltage output of the ICCP system. Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units for water tanks and used in other applications are made with [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] circuits to automatically adjust the operating voltage to maintain the optimum current output or structure-to-electrolyte [[potential]].<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.233</ref> [[analog circuit|Analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]] meters are often installed to show the operating voltage (DC and sometime AC) and current output.  For shore structures and other large complex target structures, ICCP systems are often designed with multiple independent zones of anodes with separate cathodic protection transformer-rectifier circuits.\n\n===Hybrid Systems===\nHybrid systems have been used for over a decade and incorporate the coordination, monitoring and high restorative current flow of ICCP systems with the reactive, lower cost and easier to maintain galvanic anodes.\n\nThe system is made up of wired galvanic anodes in arrays typically 400mm apart which are then initially powered for a short period to restore the concrete and power ionic migration. The power supply is then taken away and the anodes simply attached to the steel as a galvanic system. More powered phases can be administered if needed. Like Galvanic systems corrosion rate monitoring from polarisation tests and half-cell potential mapping can be used to measure corrosion. Polarization is not the goal for the life of the system.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Hot Water Tank / Water Heater===\nThis technology is also used to protect [[Water-heater|water heaters]]. Indeed, the electrons sent by the imposed current anode (composed of [[titanium]] and covered with MMO) prevents the inside of the tank from rusting.\n\nIn order to be recognized as effective, these anodes must comply with certain standards: A cathodic protection system is considered efficient when its potential reaches or exceeds the limits established by the cathodic protection criteria. The cathode protection criteria used come from the standard NACE SP0388-2007 (formerly RP0388-2001) of the NACE National Association of Corrosion Engineers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cathodic Protection Industry - NACE |url=https://www.nace.org/resources/industries-nace-serves/cathodic-protection-industry |website=www.nace.org |accessdate=24 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Pipelines===\n[[File:Cathodic Protection Rectifier.JPG|thumb|An air cooled cathodic protection rectifier connected to a pipeline.]]\n[[File:Gas Mains cathodic protection markers, Wellington Street, Leeds (12th April 2014).JPG|thumb|right|Cathodic protection markers over a gas pipeline in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].]]\n\nHazardous product [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are routinely protected by a coating supplemented with cathodic protection. An impressed current cathodic protection system (ICCP) for a pipeline consists of a DC power source, often an AC powered transformer rectifier and an anode, or array of anodes buried in the ground (the anode [[groundbed]]).\n\nThe DC power source would typically have a DC output of up to 50 [[ampere]]s and 50 [[volt]]s, but this depends on several factors, such as the size of the pipeline and coating quality. The positive DC output terminal would be connected via [[Electrical cable|cables]] to the anode array, while another cable would connect the negative terminal of the rectifier to the pipeline, preferably through junction boxes to allow measurements to be taken.<ref>Peabody p.22</ref>\n\nAnodes can be installed in a groundbed consisting of a vertical hole backfilled with conductive [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (a material that improves the performance and life of the anodes) or laid in a prepared trench, surrounded by conductive coke and backfilled. The choice of groundbed type and size depends on the application, location and soil resistivity.<ref>Peabody p.132</ref>\n\nThe DC cathodic protection current is then adjusted to the optimum level after conducting various tests including measurements of pipe-to-soil potentials or [[electrode potential]].\n\nIt is sometimes more economically viable to protect a pipeline using galvanic (sacrificial) anodes. This is often the case on smaller diameter pipelines of limited length.<ref>Peabody p.32</ref>  Galvanic anodes rely on the [[galvanic series]] potentials of the metals to drive cathodic protection current from the anode to the structure being protected.\n\nWater pipelines of various pipe materials are also provided with cathodic protection where owners determine the cost is reasonable for the expected pipeline [[service life]] extension attributed to the application of cathodic protection.\n\n===Ships and boats===\n[[File:Ship-propeller.jpg|thumb|The white patches visible on the ship's hull are zinc block sacrificial anodes.]]\n\nCathodic protection on [[ship]]s is often implemented by galvanic anodes attached to the hull and ICCP for larger vessels. Since ships are regularly removed from the water for inspections and maintenance, it is a simple task to replace the galvanic anodes.<ref>BS 7361-1:1991 Sect. 6.2</ref>\n\nGalvanic anodes are generally shaped to reduced drag in the water and fitted flush to the hull to also try to minimize drag.<ref>BS 7361-1:1991 Sect. 6.2.1.2</ref>\n\nSmaller vessels, with non-metallic hulls, such as [[yacht]]s, are equipped with galvanic anodes to protect areas such as [[outboard motor]]s.  As with all galvanic cathodic protection, this application relies on a solid electrical connection between the anode and the item to be protected.\n\nFor ICCP on ships, the anodes are usually constructed of a relatively inert material such as platinised titanium. A DC power supply is provided within the ship and the anodes mounted on the outside of the hull. The anode cables are introduced into the ship via a [[compression seal fitting]] and routed to the DC power source. The negative cable from the power supply is simply attached to the hull to complete the circuit.  Ship ICCP anodes are flush-mounted, minimizing the effects of drag on the ship, and located a minimum 5&nbsp;ft below the light [[waterline|load line]]<ref>CP-2 Cathodic Protection Technician-Maritime Student Manual NACE International, July 2009, pg 3-11</ref> in an area to avoid mechanical damage.  The current density required for protection is a function of velocity and considered when selecting the current capacity and location of anode placement on the hull.\n\nSome ships may require specialist treatment, for example aluminium hulls with steel fixtures will create an electrochemical cell where the aluminium hull can act as a galvanic anode and corrosion is enhanced. In cases like this, aluminium or zinc galvanic anodes can be used to offset the potential difference between the aluminium hull and the steel fixture.<ref>EN 12473:2000 Sect. 8.3.1</ref> If the steel fixtures are large, several galvanic anodes may be required, or even a small ICCP system.\n\n===Marine===\nMarine cathodic protection covers many areas, [[jetty|jetties]], [[harbor]]s, [[offshore construction|offshore]] structures. The variety of different types of structure leads to a variety of systems to provide protection. Galvanic anodes are favored,<ref>Roberge p.876</ref> but ICCP can also often be used.  Because of the wide variety of structure geometry, composition, and architecture, specialized firms are often required to engineer structure-specific cathodic protection systems. Sometimes marine structures require retroactive modification to be effectively protected <ref>Britton p.1</ref>\n\n===Steel in concrete===\nThe application to [[concrete]] [[rebar|reinforcement]] is slightly different in that the anodes and reference electrodes are usually embedded in the concrete at the time of construction when the concrete is being poured.  The usual technique for concrete buildings, bridges and similar structures is to use ICCP,<ref>Ashworth et al 10:82</ref> but there are systems available that use the principle of galvanic cathodic protection as well,<ref>Covino et al/</ref><ref>Daily</ref><ref>Highways Agency Sect. 4.8</ref> although in the UK at least, the use of galvanic anodes for atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete structures is considered experimental.<ref>Highways Agency Sect. 2.1</ref>\n\nFor ICCP, the principle is the same as any other ICCP system. However, in a typical atmospherically exposed concrete structure such as a bridge, there will be many more anodes distributed through the structure as opposed to an array of anodes as used on a pipeline. This makes for a more complicated system and usually an automatically controlled DC power source is used, possibly with an option for remote monitoring and operation.<ref>Highways Agency Sect. 4.5</ref> For buried or submerged structures, the treatment is similar to that of any other buried or submerged structure.\n\nGalvanic systems offer the advantage of being easier to retrofit and do not need any control systems as ICCP does.\n\nFor pipelines constructed from [[pre-stressed concrete]] cylinder pipe (PCCP), the techniques used for cathodic protection are generally as for steel pipelines except that the applied potential must be limited to prevent damage to the prestressing wire.<ref>NACE RP0100-2000 Sect. 5.2.5</ref>\n\nThe steel wire in a PCCP pipeline is stressed to the point that any corrosion of the wire can result in failure. An additional problem is that any excessive hydrogen ions as a result of an excessively negative potential can cause hydrogen embrittlement of the wire, also resulting in failure. The failure of too many wires will result in catastrophic failure of the PCCP.<ref>Gummow</ref> To implement ICCP therefore requires very careful control to ensure satisfactory protection. A simpler option is to use galvanic anodes, which are self-limiting and need no control.<ref>NACE RP0100-2000 Sect. 5.4</ref>\n\n===Internal cathodic protection===\nVessels, pipelines and tanks which are used to store or transport liquids can also be protected from corrosion on their internal surfaces by the use of cathodic protection.<ref>EN 12499:2003</ref> ICCP and galvanic systems can be used.<ref>Ashworth et al 10:112</ref> A common application of internal cathodic protection is water storage tanks and [[Power station|power plant]] [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s.\n\n===Galvanized steel===\n[[Galvanizing]] generally refers to [[hot-dip galvanizing]] which is a way of coating steel with a layer of metallic zinc or tin. Galvanized coatings are quite durable in most environments because they combine the barrier properties of a [[coating]] with some of the benefits of cathodic protection. If the zinc coating is scratched or otherwise locally damaged and steel is exposed, the surrounding areas of zinc coating form a galvanic cell with the exposed steel and protect it from corrosion. This is a form of localized cathodic protection - the zinc acts as a sacrificial anode.\n\nGalvanizing, while using the electrochemical principle of cathodic protection, is not actually cathodic protection. Cathodic protection requires the anode to be separate from the metal surface to be protected, with an ionic connection through the electrolyte and an electron connection through a connecting cable, bolt or similar. This means that any area of the protected structure within the electrolyte can be protected, whereas in the case of galvanizing, only areas very close to the zinc are protected. Hence, a larger area of bare steel would only be protected around the edges.\n\n===Automobiles===\nSeveral companies market electronic devices claiming to mitigate corrosion for automobiles and trucks.<ref>[http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/counteract-electronic-rust-protection-system-0477905p.html CounterAct at Canadian Tire retailer]</ref> Corrosion control professionals find they do not work.<ref>[http://www.nace.org/StarterApps/Wiki/Dynamic.aspx?id=367&__taxonomyid=225 NACE International Article Electronic Rust Prevention]</ref>  There is no peer reviewed scientific testing and validation supporting the use of the devices. In 1996 the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] ordered David McCready, a person that sold devices claiming to protect cars from corrosion, to pay restitution and banned the names \"Rust Buster\" and \"Rust Evader.\"<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1996/07/rust-evader-inventor-settles-ftc-charges Federal Trade Commission Press Release]</ref>\n\n==Testing==\n\n[[Electrode potential]] is measured with [[reference electrode]]s. [[Copper-copper(II) sulfate electrode|Copper-copper sulphate electrode]]s are used for structures in contact with [[soil]] or fresh water.  [[Silver chloride electrode|Silver/silver chloride/seawater electrodes]] or pure [[zinc]] electrodes are used for [[seawater]] applications. The methods are described in EN 13509:2003 and NACE TM0497 along with the sources of error<ref>NACE TM0497 Section 5.8</ref> in the voltage that appears on the display of the meter. Interpretation of electrode potential measurements to determine the potential at the interface between the anode of the corrosion cell and the electrolyte requires training<ref>NACE TM0497 Section 1.2</ref> and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of measurements done in laboratory work.\n\n==Problems==\n\n===Production of hydrogen===\nA side effect of improperly applied cathodic protection is the production of atomic [[hydrogen]],<ref>{{Google books|baHwfLpWpP8C|Fundamentals of Electrochemical Corrosion|page=174}}</ref> leading to its absorption in the protected metal and subsequent [[hydrogen embrittlement]] of welds and materials with high hardness.  Under normal conditions, the atomic hydrogen will combine at the metal surface to create hydrogen gas, which cannot penetrate the metal.  Hydrogen atoms, however, are small enough to pass through the crystalline steel structure, and lead in some cases to hydrogen embrittlement.\n\n===Cathodic disbonding===\nThis is a process of disbondment of protective coatings from the protected structure (cathode) due to the formation of hydrogen ions over the surface of the protected material (cathode).<ref>Roberge Sect. 11.4.1, p.886</ref> Disbonding can be exacerbated by an increase in alkali ions and an increase in cathodic polarization.<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.167</ref> The degree of disbonding is also reliant on the type of coating, with some coatings affected more than others.<ref>Baeckmann, Schwenck & Prinz, p.168</ref> Cathodic protection systems should be operated so that the structure does not become excessively polarized,<ref>Peabody p.37</ref> since this also promotes disbonding due to excessively negative potentials. Cathodic disbonding occurs rapidly in pipelines that contain hot fluids because the process is accelerated by heat flow.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Cathodic shielding===\nEffectiveness of cathodic protection (CP) systems on steel pipelines can be impaired by the use of solid film backed dielectric coatings such as polyethylene tapes, shrinkable pipeline sleeves, and factory applied single or multiple solid film coatings.  This phenomenon occurs because of the high electrical resistivity of these film backings.<ref>NACE International Paper 09043</ref>  Protective electric current from the cathodic protection system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film backing.  Cathodic shielding was first defined in the 1980s as being a problem, and technical papers on the subject have been regularly published since then.\n\nA 1999 report<ref>Transportation Safety Board of Canada</ref> concerning a {{convert|20600|oilbbl|abbr=on}} spill from a [[Saskatchewan]] [[crude oil]] line contains an excellent definition of the cathodic shielding problem:\n\n:\"The triple situation of disbondment of the (corrosion) coating, the dielectric nature of the coating and the unique electrochemical environment established under the exterior coating, which acts as a shield to the electrical CP current, is referred to as CP shielding.  The combination of tenting and disbondment permits a corrosive environment around the outside of the pipe to enter into the void between the exterior coating and the pipe surface.  With the development of this CP shielding phenomenon, impressed current from the CP system cannot access exposed metal under the exterior coating to protect the pipe surface from the consequences of an aggressive corrosive environment.  The CP shielding phenomenon induces changes in the potential gradient of the CP system across the exterior coating, which are further pronounced in areas of insufficient or sub-standard CP current emanating from the pipeline's CP system.  This produces an area on the pipeline of insufficient CP defense against metal loss aggravated by an exterior corrosive environment.\"\n\nCathodic shielding is referenced in a number of the standards listed below.  Newly issued USDOT regulation Title 49 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title49-vol3/pdf/CFR-2009-title49-vol3-sec192-112.pdf 192.112], in the section for ''Additional design requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure'' requires that \"The pipe must be protected against external corrosion by a non-shielding coating\" (see coatings section on standard).  Also, the NACE SP0169:2007 standard defines shielding in section 2, cautions against the use of materials that create electrical shielding in section 4.2.3, cautions against use of external coatings that create electrical shielding in section 5.1.2.3, and instructs readers to take 'appropriate action' when the effects of electrical shielding of cathodic protection current are detected on an operating pipeline in section 10.9.\n\n==Standards==\n* 49 CFR 192.451 - Requirements for Corrosion Control - Transportation of natural and other gas by pipeline: US minimum federal safety standards\n* 49 CFR 195.551 - Requirements for Corrosion Control - Transportation of hazardous liquids by pipelines: US minimum federal safety standards \n* AS 2832 - Australian Standards for Cathodic Protection\n* ASME B31Q 0001-0191\n* ASTM G 8, G 42 - Evaluating Cathodic Disbondment resistance of coatings\n* DNV-RP-B401 - Cathodic Protection Design - Det Norske Veritas\n* EN 12068:1999 - Cathodic protection.

Each motorcycle has a [[sidecar|sidehack]] (a sidecar with a rail but no sidewalls or seat), in which a passenger rides and tilts to one side or another when going around curves. The credits thank the \"Southern California Sidehack Association\"; sidehacking is also known as [[sidecarcross]] or \"sidecar motocross racing\".\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centers on Rommel, a mechanic at a motorbike repair shop who works alongside his partner Luke, and competes in sidehack-style races. He and his fianc\u00e9e Rita plan to get married soon. One day at work, he meets J.C., a hot-tempered entertainer and his crew, when he brings in his bike for repair. He sees a sidehack bike in the shop and takes a liking to it. Rommel offers J.C. and his group to join him in a sidehack event the upcoming weekend. At the event, J.C. enjoys watching Rommel race on the sidehack. Rommel offers J.C to give a ride on a sidehack with him at his and Rita's cabin, and he accepts.\n\nAfter a fun of racing on Rommel's sidehack, everyone has a get together dinner in the cabin and J.C. offers Rommel to join him, who politely declines. J.C. loses his temper as a result, and takes out his anger on his girlfriend, Paisley, after telling him he's not interested in his offer. The next day, while Rommel and Luke are working on a bike, Paisley comes over and tries to seduce Rommel into getting with her, wanting to get away from J.C., but rejects her and sends her away crying.  Later, when J.C. and his men return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang  find Rommel and Rita in their cabin making love, and proceed to beat Rommel unconscious, then they rape and kill Rita afterwards. Luke finds out what happened to Rommel and informs the police. J.C., now on the verge of being wanted for his actions, has to hide himself in isolation.\n\nDespite Luke's warnings to let the police handle the situation, Rommel wants revenge on J.C. for killing his former fianc\u00e9e, and gathers a group of men to back him up, consisting of one of J.C.'s (now former) henchmen, Nero (who joined Rommel after finally having enough of J.C.'s abuse), muscle-bound Big Jake, bailed out criminal Crapout, and another one of J.C.'s henchmen, Cooch (who's secretly working undercover for J.C.).\n\nRommel and his gang head out into the canyons where J.C. is hiding. Luke goes after Rommel to stop him from getting his revenge. Meanwhile, Rommel discusses the plan on what they're going to do to J.C., which involves being stealthy, using their hands and no guns in spite of the risk that J.C.'s men may have some on them. They're reluctant on the plan, but stick to it regardless.\n\nThe next morning, Cooch sneaks over to J.C.'s hideout while everyone is still asleep and fills him in on everything, and after he takes off, Paisley breaks up with J.C. after putting up with all of his abuse and tries to escalate his fury with Rommel. Angry, he strangles Paisley to death, and then apologizes to her dead body and chides her for making him so angry. Luke attempts to talk Rommel out of getting his revenge on J.C., but refuses and sticks with the plan. Suddenly, they see Cooch sneaking back into the spot where everyone was sleeping, and Rommel, Big Jake, Nero and Crapout gang up on him trying to find out what's going on. Cooch feigns ignorance, and they beat him up to get him to talk. Finally giving in, he tells Rommel J.C. is hiding in a rock quarry in the canyons, and Rommel orders Crapout to tie him up. Rommel goes over to Luke and asks him to call the police to let them know where J.C. is hiding, finally acknowledging that going after J.C. isn't worth it. However, he still keeps a tied-up Cooch to his side while keeping an eye out on J.C. to make sure he doesn't escape from his hideout, as Rommel's men stick with the original plan, resulting in Big Jake being killed after taking down two of J.C.'s men through stealth, and Cooch escaping, pleading J.C. not to kill Rommel, only for J.C. to kill his former weasel for being caught. With two of Rommel's men already killed, Nero and Crapout decide to play by their own rules and escape on a bike as the latter kills all of J.C.'s men with a gun instead of a battering ram as he originally planned, while J.C. attempts to shoot Rommel after Cooch exposed him. \n\nWith Rommel and J.C. left in the quarry, no guns on them, the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind. The last images of the film are a flashback of Rommel and his fianc\u00e9e rolling about in a grassy field, superimposed over a shot of Rommel's dead body.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ross Hagen]] as Rommel\n* [[Diane McBain]] as Rita\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as JC\n* [[Robert Tessier]] as Big Jake\n* Dick Merrifield as Luke\n* Claire Polan as Paisley\n* Hoke Howell as Crapout\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] Spectator (Uncredited)\n\n==''Mystery Science Theater 3000''==\nOn September 29, 1990, ''The Sidehackers'' was featured and lampooned on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

They were horrified to discover the scene in which Rommel's girlfriend Rita is raped and dies, juxtaposed with shots of Luke and Lois' children playfully roughhousing. This scene, and the discovery of Rita's nearly nude body, were removed from the episode. To make up for the missing plot point, the character of [[Crow T.

With two of Rommel's men already killed, Nero and Crapout decide to play by their own rules and escape on a bike as the latter kills all of J.C.'s men with a gun instead of a battering ram as he originally planned, while J.C. attempts to shoot Rommel after Cooch exposed him. \n\nWith Rommel and J.C. left in the quarry, no guns on them, the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind. The last images of the film are a flashback of Rommel and his fiancee rolling about in a grassy field, superimposed over a shot of Rommel's dead body.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ross Hagen]] as Rommel\n* [[Diane McBain]] as Rita\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as JC\n* [[Robert Tessier]] as Big Jake\n* Dick Merrifield as Luke\n* Claire Polan as Paisley\n* Hoke Howell as Crapout\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] Spectator (Uncredited)\n\n==''Mystery Science Theater 3000''==\nOn September 29, 1990, ''The Sidehackers'' was featured and lampooned on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

They were horrified to discover the scene in which Rommel's girlfriend Rita is raped and dies, juxtaposed with shots of Luke and Lois' children playfully roughhousing. This scene, and the discovery of Rita's nearly nude body, were removed from the episode. To make up for the missing plot point, the character of [[Crow T. Robot|Crow]] later remarks, \"For those of you playing along at home, Rita is dead.\" According to the series' [[head writer]] (and future host) [[Michael J. Nelson]], \"We were all traumatized, the scene got cut, and from that day forward, movies were watched in their entirety (for such potentially offensive content) before they were selected.\"<ref>The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, pg 21 (1996).</ref> Earlier in the episode, the dinner scene at Rommel and Rita's cabin is also edited slightly: when J.C. flies into a rage and Nero tries to calm him, J.C. pushes him away, saying \"Take your hands off me, you dirty [[nigger]]!\" The latter half of the line is muted while [[Joel Hodgson|Joel]] and the bots loudly rebuke J.C.\n\n==Soundtrack== \nThe movie's soundtrack LP was issued in 1969 in the U.S. by [[Amaret Records]] (ST 5004).

Additional credence is given to this idea by noting the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the two preceding years, 1914 and 1915, and in the following year, 1917. In 1914, [[Max von Laue]] of [[Germany]] won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals, which was a crucial step towards the invention of [[X-ray spectroscopy]]. Then, in 1915, [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], a British father-son pair, shared this Nobel Prize for their discoveries in the reverse problem \u2014 determining the structure of crystals using X-rays (Robert Charles Bragg, William Henry Bragg's other son, had also been killed at Gallipoli, on 2 September 1915<ref>{{cwgc |id=680754 |name=Bragg, Robert Charles}}</ref>). Next, Moseley used the diffraction of X-rays by known crystals in measuring the X-ray spectra of metals. This was the first use of X-ray spectroscopy and also one more step towards the creation of [[X-ray crystallography]]. In addition, Moseley's methods and analyses substantially supported the concept of [[atomic number]], placing it on a firm, physics-based foundation. Moreover, [[Charles Barkla]] of [[Great Britain]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1917 for his experimental work in using X-ray spectroscopy in discovering the [[X-ray fluorescence|characteristic X-ray frequencies]] emitted by the various elements, especially the metals.  \"[[Karl Siegbahn|Siegbahn]], who carried on Moseley's work, received one [a Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1924].\"<ref name=\"Asimov\"/>{{rp|714}} Moseley's discoveries were thus of the same scope as those of his peers, and in addition, Moseley made the larger step of demonstrating the actual foundation of atomic numbers. Ernest Rutherford commented that Moseley's work, \"Allowed him to complete during two years at the outset of his career a set of researches that would surely have brought him a Nobel prize\".<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>\n\nMemorial plaques to Moseley were installed at Manchester and Eton, and a [[Royal Society]] scholarship, established by his will, had as its second recipient the physicist [[P.

Moseley discovered a systematic mathematical relationship between the [[wavelength]]s of the X-rays produced and the atomic numbers of the metals that were used as the targets in X-ray tubes. This has become known as [[Moseley's law]].\n\nBefore Moseley's discovery, the atomic numbers (or elemental number) of an [[chemical element|element]] had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary sequential number, based on the sequence of [[atomic mass]]es, but modified somewhat where chemists found this modification to be desirable, such as by the Russian chemist, [[Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev]]. In his invention of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]], Mendeleev had interchanged the orders of a few pairs of elements in order to put them in more appropriate places in this table of the elements. For example, the metals [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]] had been assigned the atomic numbers 27 and 28, respectively, based on their known chemical and physical properties, even though they have nearly the same atomic masses. In fact, the atomic mass of cobalt is slightly larger than that of nickel, which would have placed them in backwards order if they had been placed in the Periodic Table blindly according to atomic mass. Moseley's experiments in X-ray spectroscopy showed directly from their physics that cobalt and nickel have the different atomic numbers, 27 and 28, and that they are placed in the Periodic Table correctly by Moseley's objective measurements of their atomic numbers. Hence, Moseley's discovery demonstrated that the atomic numbers of elements are not just rather arbitrary numbers based on chemistry and the intuition of chemists, but rather, they have a firm experimental basis from the physics of their X-ray spectra.\n\nIn addition, Moseley showed that there were gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75. These spaces are now known, respectively, to be the places of the radioactive synthetic elements [[technetium]] and [[promethium]], and also the last two quite rare naturally occurring stable elements [[hafnium]] (discovered 1923) and [[rhenium]] (discovered 1925). Nothing was known about these four elements in Moseley's lifetime, not even their very existence. Based on the intuition of a very experienced [[chemist]], Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted the existence of a missing element in the Periodic Table, which was later found to be filled by technetium, and [[Bohuslav Brauner]] had predicted the existence of another missing element in this Table, which was later found to be filled by promethium. Henry Moseley's experiments confirmed these predictions, by showing exactly what the missing atomic numbers were, 43 and 61. In addition, Moseley predicted the existence of two more undiscovered elements, those with the atomic numbers 72 and 75, and gave very strong evidence that there were no other gaps in the Periodic Table between the elements [[aluminium]] (atomic number 13) and [[gold]] (atomic number 79).\n\nThis latter question about the possibility of more undiscovered (\"missing\")  elements had been a standing problem among the chemists of the world, particularly given the existence of the large family of the [[lanthanide]] series of [[rare earth element]]s. Moseley was able to demonstrate that these lanthanide elements, i.e. [[lanthanum]] through [[lutetium]], must have exactly 15 members \u2013 no more and no less. The number of elements in the lanthanides had been a question that was very far from being settled by the chemists of the early 20th Century. They could not yet produce pure samples of all the rare-earth elements, even in the form of their [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, and in some cases they were unable to distinguish between mixtures of two very similar (adjacent) rare-earth elements from the nearby pure metals in the Periodic Table. For example, there was a so-called \"element\" that was even given the chemical name of \"[[didymium]]\". \"Didymium\" was found some years later to be simply a mixture of two genuine rare-earth elements, and these were given the names [[neodymium]] and [[praseodymium]], meaning \"new twin\" and \"green twin\". Also, the method of separating the rare-earth elements by the method of [[ion exchange]] had not been invented yet in Moseley's time.\n\nMoseley's method in early X-ray spectroscopy was able to sort out the above chemical problems promptly, some of which had occupied chemists for a number of years. Moseley also predicted the existence of element 61, a lanthanide whose existence was previously unsuspected. Quite a few years later, this element 61 was created artificially in [[nuclear reactor]]s and was named [[promethium]].<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=James L.

Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were not arbitrarily assigned, but rather, they have a definite physical basis. Moseley postulated that each successive element has a nuclear charge exactly one unit greater than its predecessor. Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an ''ad hoc'' numerical tag to help sorting the elements into an exact sequence of ascending atomic numbers that made the Periodic Table exact. (This was later to be the basis of the [[Aufbau principle]] in atomic studies.) As noted by Bohr, [[Moseley's law]] provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the (new from 1911) conception by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Antonius van den Broek]] of the atom, with a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged [[electron]]s in which the atomic number is understood to be the exact physical number of positive charges (later discovered and called [[proton]]s) in the central atomic nuclei of the elements. Moseley mentioned the two scientists above in his research paper, but he did not actually mention Bohr, who was rather new on the scene then. Simple modification of Rydberg's and Bohr's formulas were found to give theoretical justification for  Moseley's empirically derived law for determining atomic numbers.\n\n===Use of X-ray spectrometer===\n[[File:BigMoseleyCard.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectrometers]] are the foundation-stones of [[X-ray crystallography]]. The X-ray spectrometers as Moseley knew them worked as follows. A glass-bulb [[Vacuum tube|electron tube]] was used, similar to that held by Moseley in the photo here. Inside the evacuated tube, electrons were fired at a metallic substance (i.e. a sample of pure element in Moseley's work), causing the [[ionization]] of [[electron]]s from the inner [[electron shell]]s of the element. The rebound of electrons into these holes in the inner shells next causes the emission of X-ray [[photon]]s that were led out of the tube in a semi-beam, through an opening in the external X-ray shielding. These are next diffracted by a standardized salt crystal, with angular results read out as [[photograph]]ic lines by the exposure of an X-ray film fixed at the outside the vacuum tube at a known distance. Application of [[Bragg's law]] (after some initial guesswork of the mean distances between atoms in the metallic crystal, based on its density) next allowed the wavelength of the emitted X-rays to be calculated.\n\nMoseley participated in the design and development of early X-ray spectrometry equipment,<ref name=\"Scerri\">{{cite book |last1=Scerri |first1=Eric R.| authorlink = Eric Scerri | title = The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance | url = https://archive.org/details/periodictableits0000scer | url-access = registration | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-19-530573-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Missing\">{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=Eric R. |title=Master of Missing Elements |journal=American Scientist |date=2014 |volume=102 |pages=358\u2013365 |url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/master-of-missing-elements |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref> learning some techniques from [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] at the [[University of Leeds]], and developing others himself. Many of the techniques of [[X-ray spectroscopy]] were inspired by the methods that are used with [[light|visible light]] [[spectroscope]]s and [[spectrogram]]s, by substituting crystals, ionization chambers, and photographic plates for their analogs in light [[spectroscopy]]. In some cases, Moseley found it necessary to modify his equipment to detect particularly soft [lower [[frequency]]] X-rays that could not penetrate either air or paper, by working with his instruments in a [[vacuum chamber]].\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nSometime in the first half of 1914, Moseley resigned from his position at Manchester, with plans to return to Oxford and continue his physics research there. However, [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914, and Moseley turned down this job offer to instead enlist with the Royal Engineers of the [[British Army]]. His family and friends tried to persuade him not to join, but he thought it was his duty.<ref name=\"Reynosa\">{{cite news|last1=Reynosa|first1=Peter|title=An Ode to Henry Moseley|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-reynosa/an-ode-to-henry-moseley_b_8924690.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}</ref> Moseley served as a technical officer in communications during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], in [[Turkey]], beginning in April 1915, where he was [[killed in action]] on 10 August 1915.

[[Niels Bohr]] said in 1962 that Rutherford's work \"was not taken seriously at all\" and that the \"great change came from Moseley.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4517_1.html | title = Oral History Transcript \u2014 Niels Bohr | publisher = [[American Institute of Physics]] | accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Millikan]] wrote, \"In a research which is destined to rank as one of the dozen most brilliant in conception, skillful in execution, and illuminating in results in the history of science, a young man twenty-six years old threw open the windows through which we can glimpse the sub-atomic world with a definiteness and certainty never dreamed of before.

Additional credence is given to this idea by noting the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the two preceding years, 1914 and 1915, and in the following year, 1917. In 1914, [[Max von Laue]] of [[Germany]] won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals, which was a crucial step towards the invention of [[X-ray spectroscopy]]. Then, in 1915, [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], a British father-son pair, shared this Nobel Prize for their discoveries in the reverse problem \u2014 determining the structure of crystals using X-rays (Robert Charles Bragg, William Henry Bragg's other son, had also been killed at Gallipoli, on 2 September 1915<ref>{{cwgc |id=680754 |name=Bragg, Robert Charles}}</ref>). Next, Moseley used the diffraction of X-rays by known crystals in measuring the X-ray spectra of metals. This was the first use of X-ray spectroscopy and also one more step towards the creation of [[X-ray crystallography]]. In addition, Moseley's methods and analyses substantially supported the concept of [[atomic number]], placing it on a firm, physics-based foundation. Moreover, [[Charles Barkla]] of [[Great Britain]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1917 for his experimental work in using X-ray spectroscopy in discovering the [[X-ray fluorescence|characteristic X-ray frequencies]] emitted by the various elements, especially the metals.  \"[[Karl Siegbahn|Siegbahn]], who carried on Moseley's work, received one [a Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1924].\"<ref name=\"Asimov\"/>{{rp|714}} Moseley's discoveries were thus of the same scope as those of his peers, and in addition, Moseley made the larger step of demonstrating the actual foundation of atomic numbers. Ernest Rutherford commented that Moseley's work, \"Allowed him to complete during two years at the outset of his career a set of researches that would surely have brought him a Nobel prize\".<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>\n\nMemorial plaques to Moseley were installed at Manchester and Eton, and a [[Royal Society]] scholarship, established by his will, had as its second recipient the physicist [[P.

The film has been banned in Spain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Norway, and was temporarily banned from screening in Brazil.\n\n==Plot==\nMilo\u0161 is a semi-retired [[porn star]] and lives with his wife Marija and six-year-old son, Petar. His brother Marko is a [[Police corruption|corrupt police officer]] who envies Milo\u0161' life and is attracted to Marija. Marija is curious about her husband's past and is concerned about the family's income. Lejla, a former co-star, offers Milos a starring role in an [[art film]] directed by Vukmir, an independent [[pornographer]] who wishes to cast Milo\u0161 for his powerful [[Penile erection|erection]]. Having already caught Petar watching one of his films and not informed on the details of Vukmir's film, Milo\u0161 is hesitant to participate and continue his career, but accepts to secure his family's financial future. While meeting Vukmir, Milo\u0161 passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily.\n\t\nShooting begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Milo\u0161 instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's driver Ra\u0161a, while a film crew follows him. Milo\u0161 sees a young woman named Jeca, who is being scolded by her mother for disgracing her deceased [[war hero]] husband's memory by becoming a [[prostitute]]. In a dark room, screens show Jeca seductively eating an [[ice pop]] while Milo\u0161 is [[Fellatio|fellated]] by a nurse. Then, Milo\u0161 is instructed to receive it from the mother, while Jeca watches. Milo\u0161 refuses, but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former [[Psychology|psychologist]] and has worked in children's TV and state security. Vukmir meets a hesitant Milo\u0161 afterward to explain his artistic style, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn which is immediately raped by Ra\u0161a, in what the director terms \"newborn porn.\" Milo\u0161 storms out and drives away. At a road junction, he is approached and seduced by Vukmir's female doctor.\n\nA bloodied Milo\u0161 wakes up in his bed some time later with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the now abandoned set and finds a number of tapes. Viewing them, Milo\u0161 discovers that he was drugged to induce an aggressive, sexually aroused and suggestible state. At Vukmir's manipulative direction, Milo\u0161 beats and rapes Jeca's mother before decapitating her to induce [[rigor mortis]] and later, a catatonic Milo\u0161 is [[sodomize]]d by Vukmir's security. He then watches footage of Lejla voicing concern for Milo\u0161, only to be restrained as her teeth are removed. A masked man then enters the room and forces his penis down her throat to kill her by [[suffocation]]. The footage continues as Milo\u0161 is led to Jeca's home where an elderly woman praises him for killing her mother and offers Jeca as a \"virgin commune.\" Milo\u0161 refuses and escapes through a window to an alleyway, where he watches a girl pass by. He begins masturbating and is assaulted by a group of thugs before they are killed by Ra\u0161a, who then takes Milo\u0161 back to a warehouse with Vukmir. \n\nAt the warehouse, Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs after which Milos overpowers her, sticking the syringe into her throat. He is then taken into a room to have intercourse with two hidden bodies under a sheet. Milo\u0161 is guided onto one body and the masked man from Lejla's movie enters and begins raping the other. Milo\u0161 doesn't notice that his victim is bleeding profusely from the [[rectum]]. Vukmir then reveals the masked man to be Marko, his victim to be Marija and finally, that Milo\u0161 is raping Petar, his own son. An enraged Milo\u0161 lunges at Vukmir and smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bludgeons Marko to death with a sculpture. Milo\u0161 wrestles a gun from a guard and shoots all but the one-eyed Ra\u0161a, whom he kills by shoving his erect penis into his empty eye socket. A dying Vukmir praises Milo\u0161' actions as truly worthy of film.\n\nMilo\u0161, having recalled his actions, including locking his wife and son in their basement before passing out earlier, returns home to find them. He and his wife come to a mutual understanding that he, his wife, and his child, should [[Mass suicide|die together]], so the three gather in bed and embrace before Milos fires a fatal shot through himself, Petar, and Marija. Sometime later a new film crew, including the bald man from earlier, enters the bedroom. He unzips his [[Fly (clothing)|fly]], as the director advises him to \"start with the little one.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]] as Milo\u0161\n* [[Sergej Trifunovi\u0107]] as Vukmir\n* [[Jelena Gavrilovi\u0107]] as Marija\n* [[Slobodan Be\u0161ti\u0107]] as Marko\n* [[Katarina \u017duti\u0107]] as Lejla\n* An\u0111ela Nenadovi\u0107 as Jeca\n* Ana Saki\u0107 as Jeca's mother\n* Lidija Pletl as Jeca's granny\n* [[Lena Bogdanovi\u0107]] as a doctor\n* Luka Mijatovi\u0107 as Petar\n* Nenad Herakovi\u0107 as Keeper #1\n* Carni \u0110eri\u0107 as Keeper #2\n* Marko Crljen as Keeper #3\n* Miodrag Kr\u010dmarik as Ra\u0161a\n* Tanja Divni\u0107 as Kindergarten teacher\n* Natasa Miljus as Pregnant Woman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nSpasojevi\u0107 and Radivojevi\u0107 have stated that the film is a parody of modern politically correct films made in Serbia, which are financially supported by foreign funds.

To me that's a metaphor for something unacceptable. The second generation comes back to the country and using the money that was robbed from the people of Serbia, smears the very same people by portraying them as the worst scum of the earth. You know, when the first generation of the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]] finished [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robbing]] America, the second one built museums, galleries, charitable organizations, and financed America.

The film stars Serbian actors [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]] and [[Sergej Trifunovi\u0107]].\n\nUpon its debut on the [[art film]] circuit, the film received substantial attention and controversy for its graphic nature. The film has been banned in Spain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Norway, and was temporarily banned from screening in Brazil.\n\n==Plot==\nMilo\u0161 is a semi-retired [[porn star]] and lives with his wife Marija and six-year-old son, Petar. His brother Marko is a [[Police corruption|corrupt police officer]] who envies Milo\u0161' life and is attracted to Marija. Marija is curious about her husband's past and is concerned about the family\u2019s income. Lejla, a former co-star, offers Milos a starring role in an [[art film]] directed by Vukmir, an independent [[pornographer]] who wishes to cast Milo\u0161 for his powerful [[Penile erection|erection]]. Having already caught Petar watching one of his films and not informed on the details of Vukmir's film, Milo\u0161 is hesitant to participate and continue his career, but accepts to secure his family\u2019s financial future. While meeting Vukmir, Milo\u0161 passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily.\n\t\nShooting begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Milo\u0161 instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's driver Ra\u0161a, while a film crew follows him. Milo\u0161 sees a young woman named Jeca, who is being scolded by her mother for disgracing her deceased [[war hero]] husband's memory by becoming a [[prostitute]]. In a dark room, screens show Jeca seductively eating an [[ice pop]] while Milo\u0161 is [[Fellatio|fellated]] by a nurse. Then, Milo\u0161 is instructed to receive it from the mother, while Jeca watches. Milo\u0161 refuses, but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former [[Psychology|psychologist]] and has worked in children's TV and state security. Vukmir meets a hesitant Milo\u0161 afterward to explain his artistic style, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn which is immediately raped by Ra\u0161a, in what the director terms \"newborn porn.\" Milo\u0161 storms out and drives away. At a road junction, he is approached and seduced by Vukmir's female doctor.\n\nA bloodied Milo\u0161 wakes up in his bed some time later with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the now abandoned set and finds a number of tapes. Viewing them, Milo\u0161 discovers that he was drugged to induce an aggressive, sexually aroused and suggestible state. At Vukmir's manipulative direction, Milo\u0161 beats and rapes Jeca's mother before decapitating her to induce [[rigor mortis]] and later, a catatonic Milo\u0161 is [[sodomize]]d by Vukmir's security. He then watches footage of Lejla voicing concern for Milo\u0161, only to be restrained as her teeth are removed. A masked man then enters the room and forces his penis down her throat to kill her by [[suffocation]]. The footage continues as Milo\u0161 is led to Jeca's home where an elderly woman praises him for killing her mother and offers Jeca as a \"virgin commune.\" Milo\u0161 refuses and escapes through a window to an alleyway, where he watches a girl pass by. He begins masturbating and is assaulted by a group of thugs before they are killed by Ra\u0161a, who then takes Milo\u0161 back to a warehouse with Vukmir. \n\nAt the warehouse, Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs after which Milos overpowers her, sticking the syringe into her throat. He is then taken into a room to have intercourse with two hidden bodies under a sheet. Milo\u0161 is guided onto one body and the masked man from Lejla\u2019s movie enters and begins raping the other. Milo\u0161 doesn't notice that his victim is bleeding profusely from the [[rectum]]. Vukmir then reveals the masked man to be Marko, his victim to be Marija and finally, that Milo\u0161 is raping Petar, his own son. An enraged Milo\u0161 lunges at Vukmir and smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bludgeons Marko to death with a sculpture. Milo\u0161 wrestles a gun from a guard and shoots all but the one-eyed Ra\u0161a, whom he kills by shoving his erect penis into his empty eye socket. A dying Vukmir praises Milo\u0161' actions as truly worthy of film.\n\nMilo\u0161, having recalled his actions, including locking his wife and son in their basement before passing out earlier, returns home to find them. He and his wife come to a mutual understanding that he, his wife, and his child, should [[Mass suicide|die together]], so the three gather in bed and embrace before Milos fires a fatal shot through himself, Petar, and Marija. Sometime later a new film crew, including the bald man from earlier, enters the bedroom. He unzips his [[Fly (clothing)|fly]], as the director advises him to \"start with the little one.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]] as Milo\u0161\n* [[Sergej Trifunovi\u0107]] as Vukmir\n* [[Jelena Gavrilovi\u0107]] as Marija\n* [[Slobodan Be\u0161ti\u0107]] as Marko\n* [[Katarina \u017duti\u0107]] as Lejla\n* An\u0111ela Nenadovi\u0107 as Jeca\n* Ana Saki\u0107 as Jeca's mother\n* Lidija Pletl as Jeca's granny\n* [[Lena Bogdanovi\u0107]] as a doctor\n* Luka Mijatovi\u0107 as Petar\n* Nenad Herakovi\u0107 as Keeper #1\n* Carni \u0110eri\u0107 as Keeper #2\n* Marko Crljen as Keeper #3\n* Miodrag Kr\u010dmarik as Ra\u0161a\n* Tanja Divni\u0107 as Kindergarten teacher\n* Natasa Miljus as Pregnant Woman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nSpasojevi\u0107 and Radivojevi\u0107 have stated that the film is a parody of modern politically correct films made in Serbia, which are financially supported by foreign funds.

The title is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] reference to that image. Srpski Film is also a metaphor for our national cinema \u2014 boring, predictable and altogether unintentionally hilarious which throughout our film to some extent is commented on and subtly parodied.\" Similarly, Radivojevi\u0107 describes [[Serbian cinema]] as \"...pathetic state financed films made by people who have no sense or connection to film, but are strongly supported by foreign funds.

To me that's a metaphor for something unacceptable. The second generation comes back to the country and using the money that was robbed from the people of Serbia, smears the very same people by portraying them as the worst scum of the earth. You know, when the first generation of the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]] finished [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robbing]] America, the second one built museums, galleries, charitable organizations, and financed America.

{"title_page": "Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina", "text_new": "{{Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nThe '''Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Ustav Bosne i Hertcegovine'' / \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435) is the highest legal document of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The current Constitution is the Annex 4 of The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the [[Dayton Agreement]], signed on 14 December 1995. The Constitution saw the end of [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], however it has seen a large amount of criticism. Under the supervision of international community, an \"arrangement of amendments\" (later called \"April arrangement of amendments\") to the Constitution, agreed upon by leading political parties, was proposed for adoption in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in April 2006, but it failed to get the approval of two-thirds of members in the House of Representatives.\n\n==Nature of the Constitution==\n\nThe Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the constitution in international contractual form, since it is an integral part of a larger peace agreement signed by [[Alija Izetbegovi\u0107]], [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] and [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], three presidents of countries involved in [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as well as the representatives of [[European Union]] ([[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]]), [[United States|United States of America]] ([[Bill Clinton]]), [[Germany]] ([[Helmut Kohl]]), [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]] ([[John Major]]), [[France]] ([[Jacques Chirac]]) and [[Russia|Russian Federation]] ([[Viktor Chernomyrdin]]). This nature of the Constitution was also of vital importance for the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in its landmark decision on constituency of peoples (U-5/98), since it declared that the Constitution could be interpreted as a treaty defined in [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] from 1969, which was of great importance in the interpretation of the Preamble of the Constitution.\n\n==The Preamble==\n\nThe Preamble states, among other things, the commitment of Bosnia and Herzegovina to freedom, equality, tolerance and democratic institutions of government. It also states that the carriers of sovereignty are \"constituent peoples\" ([[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]]), along with [[Demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|\"Others\" and \"citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina\"]], which has also seen a great amount of debate between legal scholars over an apparent contradiction.\n\n== Articles==\n\n*'''Article I''' - on [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: Continuation, Democratic Principles, [[Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Composition]], Movement of Goods, [[Sarajevo|Capital]], [[Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Symbols]] and Citizenship \n*'''Article II''' - on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: Human Rights, International Standards, Enumeration of Rights, Non-Discrimination, Refugees and Displaced Persons, Implementation, International Agreements and Cooperation\n*'''Article III''' - on Responsibilities of and Relations Between the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities: Responsibilities of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Responsibilities of the Entities, Law and Responsibilities of the Entities and the Institutions, Coordination and Additional Responsibilities \n*'''Article IV''' - on [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]]: [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]], [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]], Procedures and Powers\n*'''Article V''' - on [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]]: Election and Term, Procedures, Powers, [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] and Standing Committee\n*'''Article VI''' - on [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitutional Court]]: Composition, Procedures, Jurisdiction and Decisions\n*'''Article VII''' - on [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Central Bank]] \n*'''Article VIII''' - on Finances\n*'''Article IX''' - on General Provisions\n*'''Article X''' - on Amendment Procedure\n*'''Article XI''' - on Transitional Arrangements\n*'''Article XII''' - on Entry into Force\n\n==Annexes==\n\n*'''Annex I''' - on Additional Human Rights Agreements To Be Applied In Bosnia And Herzegovina\n**1. 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] \n**2. 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]] I-IV on the Protection of the Victims of War, and the 1977 Geneva Protocols I-II thereto \n**3. 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the 1966 Protocol thereto \n**4. 1957 [[Convention on the Nationality of Married Women]] \n**5.

Also, the Constitution states that Bosnia and Herzegovina \"shall remain or become party to the international agreements listed in Annex I to this Constitution\" (Article II, 7.), and in all there are fifteen of these international agreements. The Constitution also states that no amendment to the Constitution can eliminate or diminish any of the rights and freedoms referred to in Article II of the Constitution (Article X, 2.).\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has made several notable decisions in the interpretation of these provisions, with most important being the \"Decision on the Constituency of Peoples\" (U-5/98). Still there are great criticisms of the Constitution, stating that it is of discriminatory nature, since in many of its articles it discriminates against citizens that are not from \"constituent peoples\", such as the Article V which sets out the rules for the election of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There has been an attempt to challenge the Electoral law, which has the basis in the Constitution, which is seen as being discriminatory to \"Others\", as well as to \"constituent peoples\" to some degree, by trying to interpret the Article II(2) in a way that the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocols have the supremacy over the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina itself. However, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declined this position in its decision number U-5/04. This has led Jakob Finci, the leader of Jewish community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to file [[Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina|a suit]] against Bosnia and Herzegovina in front of [[European Court of Human Rights]], which acknowledged his ineligibility for Presidency and House of Peoples to be in violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].\n\n==The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina==\n{{main|Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a special court ''sui generis'', whose main role is to be the interpreter and guardian of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as stated in Article VI, paragraph 3 of the Constitution (\"The Constitutional Court shall uphold this Constitution\"), and it is considered to be the highest judicial authority, since it has the appellate jurisdiction over issues under the Constitution arising out of a judgement of any other court in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Article VI, paragraph 3.b).\n\n==Amending the Constitution==\n\nIn the Article X, defining the amendment procedure, the Constitution states that it can be amended by a decision of the Parliamentary Assembly, including a two-thirds majority of those present and voting in the House of Representatives. The Constitution does not say who has the right, and under what rules, to present the amendments to the Parliamentary Assembly. Also, in the paragraph 2 of the Article X, the Constitution states that the rights and freedoms, as seen in the Article II, cannot be derogated, as well as the paragraph 2 itself.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v.

{"title_page": "Berthold Nebel", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date = January 2010}}\n\n[[Image:HispanicSocietyRelief4.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Nebel's work at the [[Hispanic Society of America]], NYC]]\n\n'''Berthold Nebel''' (1889\u20131964) was an [[United States|American]] [[sculptor]].\n\nBerthold Nebel was born in 1889 in [[Basel, Switzerland]], and came to the United States with his parents when he was a year old.\n\nHe could be confused with the German sculptor [[Paul Nebel]] from [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], who is famous for motion studies of elks and bears that were casted in bronze on request by Kraas, Berlin.\n\n== Training ==\n\nBy 1900 his parents had settled in [[New Jersey]], and Nebel as a young boy took lessons in [[oil painting]] from \u201can artist lady\u201d who told him she could teach him nothing more and that he must go to art school. He began work at a decorative [[terra cotta]] factory in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]], where he learned to model in clay.  This factory produced architectural ornaments for [[Fifth Avenue]] mansions at the time.  This exposure to a new media shifted his interest from painting to sculpture.\n\nWhile he was working days he studied at night at the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Mechanics' Institute]], and attended [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser's]] classes at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Fraser was very supportive of Nebel\u2019s work, and encouraged him to enter a competition. Nebel won the prize for the [[Rome Prize]] in 1914 when the subject for sculptors and painters was \u201cGood Government.\u201d He won the sculpture\u2019s prize with a group of a seated woman, a standing man, and a child: a family and an interpretation of good government and good living that represented his personal philosophy throughout his life. The group was shown at the 30th Annual Exhibition of the [[Architectural League of New York]] in February 1915.\n\nHis three-year fellowship from 1914-1917 at the [[American Academy in Rome]] coincided with the early years of World War I.  When the United States entered the war in 1917, Nebel remained in Italy and became a supply officer and interpreter for the Red Cross. With this job, he was able to marry the former Maria Lucantoni, whom he met at the American Academy in Rome when she was a model.\n\nWhile at the Academy Nebel became interested in the plays of [[Sophocles]].  Nebel created a plaque of [[Oedipus Rex]] at Colonus.  His models for this group were his future wife, her sister Francesco, and their father, who, like the literary figure he portrayed, also went blind in old age. As an Academician, Nebel met Rodin and was greatly influenced by his modern style. This encounter encouraged Nebel to depart from the Academy\u2019s classical tradition. He executed the heroic group ''Wrestlers'' \u2013 two figures locked in Greco-Roman wrestling holds that prevent either man from winning. The figure was exhibited in Rome at the Italian artists\u2019 Exposione di Belle Arte. Nebel was the only Academy to be asked to exhibit with the Italians in their expositions. Wrestlers was later exhibited in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland, and New York City.\n\n== Work in New York ==\n\nIn 1920 Nebel returned to the United States with his wife, and his young son, Emil. He worked as an assistant to Fraser in his studio in McDougal Alley in New York City the winter of 1920, and while there he met [[Charles Follen McKim]] of the architectural firm McKim, Meade, and White. McKim, on seeing the Wrestlers, jokingly asked Nebel if her were \u201cgoing Bolshevik\u201d by doing all \u201cthis modern stuff,\u201d referring to a contemporary association of modern art with Russia. Later that year Nebel accepted the post of Director of the School of Sculpture at Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie-Mellon University]].  He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with his wife and son in 1920. While in Pittsburgh he won a competition sponsored by the Bureau of Mines and was commissioned to design and execute the Mine Rescue Medal. He was also commissioned by the Department of Interior to make the Congressional First Aid Medal. He designed a portrait relief of Theodore Roosevelt in bronze for the City County Building in Pittsburgh and a portrait relief of then First President of Carnegie Institute of Technology, Arthur Anton Hamerschlog. While teaching at Carnegie-Tech, Nebel and his wife had a daughter named Lucia.\n\nYearning to be back in New York City, Nebel returned to New York in 1925 and established a studio in the Bible Building on East 8th Street where he became engaged in architectural sculpture, principally ornamentation for the domes and niches of the [[Cunard Building (New York City)|Cunard Building]] on lower Broadway in New York City. He was also commissioned to make portrait statues of confederate [[Joseph Wheeler (sculpture)|General Joseph Wheeler for the rotunda of the United States Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., of General John Sedgwick for the front of the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford, and of Alexander Brown for the entrance to Brown Brothers Bank on Wall Street in New York City.\n\nIn 1925, Nebel patented an enlarging machine for reproducing 3D sculpture by a \u201cscrape method.\u201d Models of any size could be enlarged from smaller originals. This provided a vast improvement over the \u201cpoint\u201d system which had been used to scale models up or down since the time of the classic Greek sculptors.\n\n== Work at Audubon Terrace ==\n\nA meeting with Archer M. Huntington in 1928 resulted in a series of commissions that occupied Nebel for more than a decade. The first project was two sets of bronze doors for the Museum of the American Indian and the Museum of the American Geographic Society in the complex of buildings he created at [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155th Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City. This work required larger working space, and in 1930 Nebel moved his studio and home to Westport, Connecticut. He first worked in a converted barn on the {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm he had bought and later specially constructed a stone studio building.\n\nFor the [[Hispanic Society of America]], also at 155th Street and Broadway, Huntington commissioned Nebel to execute nine bas-relief panels measuring {{convert|5|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|19|ft|m}} high for the south fa\u00e7ade of the building in limestone. Each panel\u2019s single figure show a representation of a people \u2013 Celt, Primitive Man, Roman, Carthaginian, Arab, Phoenician, Greek, Visigoth, and Christian Knight, who had invaded and flourished in Spain. The work went on for ten years and the panels were installed in 1939. Huntington also commissioned a marble figure of The Nereid for Brookgreen Gardens,  the sculpture museum he and his wife, sculptor [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], founded in South Carolina.\n\n== Medallist ==\n\nSix months before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Nebel had designed a medal called ''World Unity or Oblivion.'' This depicted on the reverse side the then-unfamiliar but now recognized \u201cmushroom cloud\u201d of a pyrocumulus explosion over a foreground covered by mutilated human bodies. Nebel was horrified by the advancing technological developments of warfare and wrote, \u201cModern warfare has developed to such a degree that civilization may vanish from the earth unless there is a better understanding among nations. This medal was designed to help impress that thought which I believe is uppermost in our minds.\u201d The Society of Medalists issued the medal in 1945 immediately after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. President Eisenhower later presented a copy to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn 1957 Nebel was commissioned to design a medal to commemorate the crossing of the Mayflower replica and the 1620 signing of the Mayflower Compact on board the original ship. Silver copies of this medal were presented to President Eisenhower, Queen Elizabeth II, and Alan Villiers, captain of the second Mayflower.  In 1960 on the 50th anniversary of the Medallic Art Company, Nebel also designed a medal to commemorate that event.\n\nOver the years, while teaching and working on commissions, Nebel made many sketches, some cast only in plaster. These include preliminary designs for future works, ideas he was developing for national competitions and pieces for his own pleasure. Among these last are several portrait heads of his father Emil Nebel; Albin Polasek, a sculptor friend he met in Pittsburgh; Anthony Di Nardo, an architect from Cleveland; and [[Eugene Francis Savage (painter)|Eugene Francis Savage]], a muralist who had been a fellow Academician at the American Academy in Rome. Another group, which he sculpted around 1919, was Mother and Child, posed for by his wife \u201cMarietta\u201d and their son Emil. Another of these studies, sculpted and cast in bronze while he was working in Rome, is Conchetta, a woman carrying on her head the traditional copper water jug of the Italian hill towns.\n\nOne of the last figures he worked on, called ''Adventure,'' shows a man and woman riding together on a farm horse toward a new life, a tribute to the young people putting their lives together after World War II and perhaps a memory of his own life after World War I. His work had come full circle, again depicting the good life and good government in the simple form a man and a woman, a family, facing the world.\n\nHe died of [[leukemia]] in 1964 in [[Westport, Connecticut]].  Nebel was a fellow of the [[American Academy in Rome]]; a National Academician of the National Academy of Design, which holds in their permanent collection a small bronze study of Wrestlers; and a member of the [[National Sculpture Society]].\n\nFollowing his death, Nebel's studio was enjoyed by his daughter Lucia Nebel White, a photographer, and her husband, George A. White, the well-known builder-architect.\n\n== Sources ==\n\n* E.

He began work at a decorative [[terra cotta]] factory in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]], where he learned to model in clay.  This factory produced architectural ornaments for [[Fifth Avenue]] mansions at the time.  This exposure to a new media shifted his interest from painting to sculpture.\n\nWhile he was working days he studied at night at the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Mechanics' Institute]], and attended [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser's]] classes at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Fraser was very supportive of Nebel\u2019s work, and encouraged him to enter a competition. Nebel won the prize for the [[Rome Prize]] in 1914 when the subject for sculptors and painters was \u201cGood Government.\u201d He won the sculpture\u2019s prize with a group of a seated woman, a standing man, and a child: a family and an interpretation of good government and good living that represented his personal philosophy throughout his life. The group was shown at the 30th Annual Exhibition of the [[Architectural League of New York]] in February 1915.\n\nHis three-year fellowship from 1914-1917 at the [[American Academy in Rome]] coincided with the early years of World War I.  When the United States entered the war in 1917, Nebel remained in Italy and became a supply officer and interpreter for the Red Cross. With this job, he was able to marry the former Maria Lucantoni, whom he met at the American Academy in Rome when she was a model.\n\nWhile at the Academy Nebel became interested in the plays of [[Sophocles]].  Nebel created a plaque of [[Oedipus Rex]] at Colonus.  His models for this group were his future wife, her sister Francesco, and their father, who, like the literary figure he portrayed, also went blind in old age. As an Academician, Nebel met Rodin and was greatly influenced by his modern style. This encounter encouraged Nebel to depart from the Academy\u2019s classical tradition. He executed the heroic group ''Wrestlers'' \u2013 two figures locked in Greco-Roman wrestling holds that prevent either man from winning. The figure was exhibited in Rome at the Italian artists\u2019 Exposione di Belle Arte. Nebel was the only Academy to be asked to exhibit with the Italians in their expositions. Wrestlers was later exhibited in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland, and New York City.\n\n== Work in New York ==\n\nIn 1920 Nebel returned to the United States with his wife, and his young son, Emil. He worked as an assistant to Fraser in his studio in McDougal Alley in New York City the winter of 1920, and while there he met [[Charles Follen McKim]] of the architectural firm McKim, Meade, and White. McKim, on seeing the Wrestlers, jokingly asked Nebel if her were \u201cgoing Bolshevik\u201d by doing all \u201cthis modern stuff,\u201d referring to a contemporary association of modern art with Russia. Later that year Nebel accepted the post of Director of the School of Sculpture at Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie-Mellon University]].  He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with his wife and son in 1920. While in Pittsburgh he won a competition sponsored by the Bureau of Mines and was commissioned to design and execute the Mine Rescue Medal. He was also commissioned by the Department of Interior to make the Congressional First Aid Medal. He designed a portrait relief of Theodore Roosevelt in bronze for the City County Building in Pittsburgh and a portrait relief of then First President of Carnegie Institute of Technology, Arthur Anton Hamerschlog. While teaching at Carnegie-Tech, Nebel and his wife had a daughter named Lucia.\n\nYearning to be back in New York City, Nebel returned to New York in 1925 and established a studio in the Bible Building on East 8th Street where he became engaged in architectural sculpture, principally ornamentation for the domes and niches of the [[Cunard Building (New York City)|Cunard Building]] on lower Broadway in New York City. He was also commissioned to make portrait statues of confederate [[Joseph Wheeler (sculpture)|General Joseph Wheeler for the rotunda of the United States Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., of General John Sedgwick for the front of the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford, and of Alexander Brown for the entrance to Brown Brothers Bank on Wall Street in New York City.\n\nIn 1925, Nebel patented an enlarging machine for reproducing 3D sculpture by a \u201cscrape method.\u201d Models of any size could be enlarged from smaller originals. This provided a vast improvement over the \u201cpoint\u201d system which had been used to scale models up or down since the time of the classic Greek sculptors.\n\n== Work at Audubon Terrace ==\n\nA meeting with Archer M. Huntington in 1928 resulted in a series of commissions that occupied Nebel for more than a decade. The first project was two sets of bronze doors for the Museum of the American Indian and the Museum of the American Geographic Society in the complex of buildings he created at [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155th Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City. This work required larger working space, and in 1930 Nebel moved his studio and home to Westport, Connecticut. He first worked in a converted barn on the {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm he had bought and later specially constructed a stone studio building.\n\nFor the [[Hispanic Society of America]], also at 155th Street and Broadway, Huntington commissioned Nebel to execute nine bas-relief panels measuring {{convert|5|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|19|ft|m}} high for the south fa\u00e7ade of the building in limestone. Each panel\u2019s single figure show a representation of a people \u2013 Celt, Primitive Man, Roman, Carthaginian, Arab, Phoenician, Greek, Visigoth, and Christian Knight, who had invaded and flourished in Spain. The work went on for ten years and the panels were installed in 1939. Huntington also commissioned a marble figure of The Nereid for Brookgreen Gardens,  the sculpture museum he and his wife, sculptor [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], founded in South Carolina.\n\n== Medallist ==\n\nSix months before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Nebel had designed a medal called ''World Unity or Oblivion.'' This depicted on the reverse side the then-unfamiliar but now recognized \u201cmushroom cloud\u201d of a pyrocumulus explosion over a foreground covered by mutilated human bodies. Nebel was horrified by the advancing technological developments of warfare and wrote, \u201cModern warfare has developed to such a degree that civilization may vanish from the earth unless there is a better understanding among nations. This medal was designed to help impress that thought which I believe is uppermost in our minds.\u201d The Society of Medalists issued the medal in 1945 immediately after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. President Eisenhower later presented a copy to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn 1957 Nebel was commissioned to design a medal to commemorate the crossing of the Mayflower replica and the 1620 signing of the Mayflower Compact on board the original ship. Silver copies of this medal were presented to President Eisenhower, Queen Elizabeth II, and Alan Villiers, captain of the second Mayflower.  In 1960 on the 50th anniversary of the Medalic Art Company, Nebel also designed a medal to commemorate that event.\n\nOver the years, while teaching and working on commissions, Nebel made many sketches, some cast only in plaster. These include preliminary designs for future works, ideas he was developing for national competitions and pieces for his own pleasure. Among these last are several portrait heads of his father Emil Nebel; Albin Polasek, a sculptor friend he met in Pittsburgh; Anthony Di Nardo, an architect from Cleveland; and [[Eugene Francis Savage (painter)|Eugene Francis Savage]], a muralist who had been a fellow Academician at the American Academy in Rome.

It is based on the character [[Red Sonja|of the same name]], created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], who itself is based mainly on the character [[Red Sonya of Rogatino]], created by [[Robert E. Howard]]. The film introduces [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as the title character, with [[Sandahl Bergman]], [[Paul L. Smith|Paul Smith]], [[Ronald Lacey]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in supporting roles.\n\nAs in Howard's stories of Conan, the film takes place in the [[Hyborian Age]], a fictional prehistoric time that had been depicted previously in the films ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) and ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984).\n\n''Red Sonja'' was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 1985, by [[MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]]. Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It grossed $6.9 million in the United States under a budget of $17.9 million, becoming a [[box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nSonja, a young, red-haired woman, is raped and left for dead by the soldiers of Queen Gedren, a despot who murdered Sonja's parents and brother after she scarred the queen's face in rejection of her sexual advances. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess, [[Sc\u00e1thach]], appears to her and gives her heightened strength, stamina, agility and fighting skills on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat. She trains under a sword master called \"The Grand Master\" and is distrustful of all men besides him. At a nearby temple, Varna, Sonja's sister, is a member of an order of priestesses who are preparing to banish a mystical light-powered relic, the Talisman, that created the world and all living things. The Talisman can only be used and touched by women \u2013 men vanish if they touch it \u2013 and has become too powerful to control. However, Gedren's army and her [[aide-de-camp]] Ikol intervene and slaughter most of the priestesses and shield maidens before they can imprison the Talisman in permanent darkness. \n\nVarna watches Gedren steal the Talisman and imprison the surviving priestesses in the vault that contained it before escaping, but is mortally wounded. She is discovered by Kalidor, the Lord of Hyrkania, who goes to find Sonya and bring her back to Varna. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja to find the Talisman and send it into darkness before it ravages the world with storms and earthquakes. Kalidor asks to accompany her, but she rejects the offer. After witnessing the Talisman in use, Sonja arrives to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. She meets the young, pig-headed Prince Tarn and his servant Falkon, who say that Gedren used the Talisman to completely decimate Hablock when Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn, demanding vengeance, announces that he will crush Gedren and invites Sonja to work for him as a cook. She politely declines before being told that Gedren is based in Berkubane, the land of Perpetual Night.\n\nArriving at the mountain gate, Sonja fights Lord Brytag after he refuses her passage for not paying him a 'tender tribute'. When she kills him and takes his key, his troops surround her; Kalidor, who has secretly been following her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn again, being tortured by bandits. She frees Tarn and kills the bandits with Falkon. They decide to stay together and travel onward toward Berkubane, and Tarn takes Sonja's advice and utilises some good manners over sword practice. Gedren's wizard uses a large magic dish to show the approaching party; Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought to the fortress unharmed. Using the Talisman to conjure up a storm, she forces Sonja's group to take shelter in a watery cavern in Ictyan where Gedran's \u201cKilling Machine\" is unleashed upon them. Kalidor appears and helps Sonja blind the mechanical beast so they can escape.\n\nSonja accepts Kalidor's company after learning he is a descendant of the lords who entrusted the Talisman to the priestess temple. He flirts with her, so she warns him that \"no man can have her\" unless he can defeat her in a sword fight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw, despite Tarn trying to knobble Kalidor to tip the duel into Sonja's favour. The party arrives at Castle Berkubane and, to protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind and guard the front entrance. Ikol, realizing Gedren is insane when she refuses his pleas to stop utilizing the unstable relic, plans to escape the castle with bags of Hablock's gold. Sonja confronts Gedren in her council chamber while Kalidor and Falkon deal with her guards in the castle's dining hall. Ikol is stopped by Tarn at the entrance and is crushed to death by the door.\n\nNo match for Sonja, Gedren flees to the Chamber of Lights where the Talisman is stored. Now powerful beyond control, the Talisman causes the floor to split open and reveal a chasm of molten lava beneath the castle. Sonja and Gedren duel in the Chamber; Sonja runs Gedren through with her sword, sending the evil ruler plunging into the lava below. Sonja throws the Talisman in after her, destroying it and starting a chain reaction that tears Castle Berkubane apart. The heroes manage to escape as the castle is consumed by the rising volcano. Prince Tarn and Falkon eventually depart to rebuild Hablock while Sonja and Kalidor halfheartedly spar again before kissing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[Red Sonja]]\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Lord Kalidor\n* [[Sandahl Bergman]] as Queen Gedren of Berkubane\n* [[Paul L.

On a 2015 episode of ''[[Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', soap opera actress [[Eileen Davidson]] revealed that she auditioned for the role and was actually runner-up to Brigitte Nielsen. It took Laurentiis almost a year to find an actress \"Amazonian\" enough to play the title character; he was still looking, eight weeks before the scheduled production, when he saw Brigitte Nielsen on the cover of a fashion magazine. The 21-year-old native of [[Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Denmark]], in [[Milan]] for a modeling job, soon found herself on a plane heading for Rome and a successful screen test.<ref name=\"rottentomatoes1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017352-red_sonja/news/1922674/marvel_movie_madness_part_20_red_sonja/ |title=Marvel Movie Madness!

It is based on the character [[Red Sonja|of the same name]], created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], who itself is based mainly on the character [[Red Sonya of Rogatino]], created by [[Robert E. Howard]]. The film introduces [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as the title character, with [[Sandahl Bergman]], [[Paul L. Smith|Paul Smith]], [[Ronald Lacey]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in supporting roles.\n\nAs in Howard's stories of Conan, the film takes place in the [[Hyborian Age]], a fictional prehistoric time that had been depicted previously in the films ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) and ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984).\n\n''Red Sonja'' was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 1985, by [[MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]]. Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It grossed $6.9 million in the United States under a budget of $17.9 million, becoming a [[box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nSonja, a young, red-haired woman, is raped and left for dead by the soldiers of Queen Gedren, a despot who murdered Sonja's parents and brother after she scarred the queen's face in rejection of her sexual advances. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess, [[Sc\u00e1thach]], appears to her and gives her heightened strength, stamina, agility and fighting skills on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat. She trains under a sword master called \"The Grand Master\" and is distrustful of all men besides him. At a nearby temple, Varna, Sonja's sister, is a member of an order of priestesses who are preparing to banish a mystical light-powered relic, the Talisman, that created the world and all living things. The Talisman can only be used and touched by women \u2013 men vanish if they touch it \u2013 and has become too powerful to control. However, Gedren's army and her [[aide-de-camp]] Ikol intervene and slaughter most of the priestesses and shield maidens before they can imprison the Talisman in permanent darkness. \n\nVarna watches Gedren steal the Talisman and imprison the surviving priestesses in the vault that contained it before escaping, but is mortally wounded. She is discovered by Kalidor, the Lord of Hyrkania, who goes to find Sonya and bring her back to Varna. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja to find the Talisman and send it into darkness before it ravages the world with storms and earthquakes. Kalidor asks to accompany her, but she rejects the offer. After witnessing the Talisman in use, Sonja arrives to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. She meets the young, pig-headed Prince Tarn and his servant Falkon, who say that Gedren used the Talisman to completely decimate Hablock when Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn, demanding vengeance, announces that he will crush Gedren and invites Sonja to work for him as a cook. She politely declines before being told that Gedren is based in Berkubane, the land of Perpetual Night.\n\nArriving at the mountain gate, Sonja fights Lord Brytag after he refuses her passage for not paying him a 'tender tribute'. When she kills him and takes his key, his troops surround her; Kalidor, who has secretly been following her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn again, being tortured by bandits. She frees Tarn and kills the bandits with Falkon. They decide to stay together and travel onward toward Berkubane, and Tarn takes Sonja\u2019s advice and utilises some good manners over sword practice. Gedren's wizard uses a large magic dish to show the approaching party; Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought to the fortress unharmed. Using the Talisman to conjure up a storm, she forces Sonja's group to take shelter in a watery cavern in Ictyan where Gedran\u2019s \u201cKilling Machine\" is unleashed upon them. Kalidor appears and helps Sonja blind the mechanical beast so they can escape.\n\nSonja accepts Kalidor's company after learning he is a descendant of the lords who entrusted the Talisman to the priestess temple. He flirts with her, so she warns him that \"no man can have her\" unless he can defeat her in a sword fight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw, despite Tarn trying to knobble Kalidor to tip the duel into Sonja\u2019s favour. The party arrives at Castle Berkubane and, to protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind and guard the front entrance. Ikol, realizing Gedren is insane when she refuses his pleas to stop utilizing the unstable relic, plans to escape the castle with bags of Hablock's gold. Sonja confronts Gedren in her council chamber while Kalidor and Falkon deal with her guards in the castle's dining hall. Ikol is stopped by Tarn at the entrance and is crushed to death by the door.\n\nNo match for Sonja, Gedren flees to the Chamber of Lights where the Talisman is stored. Now powerful beyond control, the Talisman causes the floor to split open and reveal a chasm of molten lava beneath the castle. Sonja and Gedren duel in the Chamber; Sonja runs Gedren through with her sword, sending the evil ruler plunging into the lava below. Sonja throws the Talisman in after her, destroying it and starting a chain reaction that tears Castle Berkubane apart. The heroes manage to escape as the castle is consumed by the rising volcano. Prince Tarn and Falkon eventually depart to rebuild Hablock while Sonja and Kalidor halfheartedly spar again before kissing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[Red Sonja]]\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Lord Kalidor\n* [[Sandahl Bergman]] as Queen Gedren of Berkubane\n* [[Paul L.

Bergman was offered the role of Red Sonja, but turned it down, choosing instead to play the villainous Queen Gedren.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.filmwerk.co.uk/2011/03/06/comic-book-movies-red-sonja/|title=Comic Book Movies: Red Sonja|publisher=Filmwerk.co.uk}}</ref> De Laurentiis met with actress [[Laurene Landon]] and was set to offer her the role of Red Sonja until he discovered she was in an earlier film called ''[[Hundra]]''; fearing that it was too similar, de Laurentiis decided not to give her the part. On a 2015 episode of ''[[Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', soap opera actress [[Eileen Davidson]] revealed that she auditioned for the role and was actually runner-up to Brigitte Nielsen. It took Laurentiis almost a year to find an actress \"Amazonian\" enough to play the title character; he was still looking, eight weeks before the scheduled production, when he saw Brigitte Nielsen on the cover of a fashion magazine. The 21-year-old native of [[Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Denmark]], in [[Milan]] for a modeling job, soon found herself on a plane heading for Rome and a successful screen test.<ref name=\"rottentomatoes1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017352-red_sonja/news/1922674/marvel_movie_madness_part_20_red_sonja/ |title=Marvel Movie Madness!

Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas.

An example of a dwarf shrub is the [[bearberry]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).\n\n=== Animals ===\n{{see also|List of Arctic cetaceans}}{{Category see also|Fauna of the Arctic|Mammals of the Arctic}}\n[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]\n[[File:Snowy Owl Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[snowy owl]]]]\nHerbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]]. They are preyed on by the [[snowy owl]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Grizzly bear]], and [[Arctic wolf]]. The [[polar bear]] is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [[:Category:Birds of the Arctic|birds]] and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other terrestrial animals include [[wolverine]]s, [[moose]], [[Dall sheep]], [[Stoat|ermines]], and [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s. Marine mammals include [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and several species of [[cetacea]]n\u2014[[baleen whale]]s and also [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[Beluga whale|belugas]].

The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.\n\nThe Arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region.

The area can be defined as north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (66\u00b0 33'N), the approximate southern limit of the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]]. Another definition of the Arctic is the region where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below {{convert|10|\u00b0C}}; the northernmost [[tree line]] roughly follows the [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] at the boundary of this region.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/arctic \"arctic.\"] ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).''

Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [[global warming]], leading to [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic sea ice shrinkage]], diminished ice in the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and [[Arctic methane release]] as the [[permafrost]] thaws.\n\nDue to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on||order=flip}} per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by [[tree line]] and temperature) is currently shrinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |last=Hansen |first=Jim |title=The Planet in Peril \u2013 Part I |publisher=Yale Center for the Study of Globalization |date=19 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015173024/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}</ref> Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage.

An example of a dwarf shrub is the [[bearberry]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).\n\n=== Animals ===\n{{see also|List of Arctic cetaceans}}{{Category see also|Fauna of the Arctic|Mammals of the Arctic}}\n[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]\n[[File:Snowy Owl Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[snowy owl]]]]\nHerbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]]. They are preyed on by the [[snowy owl]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Grizzly bear]], and [[Arctic wolf]]. The [[polar bear]] is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [[:Category:Birds of the Arctic|birds]] and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other terrestrial animals include [[wolverine]]s, [[moose]], [[Dall sheep]], [[Stoat|ermines]], and [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s. Marine mammals include [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and several species of [[cetacea]]n\u2014[[baleen whale]]s and also [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[Beluga whale|belugas]]. An excellent and famous example of a [[ring species]] exists and has been described around the Arctic Circle in the form of the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.\n\n== Natural resources ==\n{{See also|Natural resources of the Arctic|Petroleum exploration in the Arctic}}\n\nThe Arctic includes copious [[natural resource]]s (oil, gas, minerals, fresh water, fish and, if the subarctic is included, forest) to which modern technology and the [[Arctic resources race|economic opening up of Russia]] have given significant new opportunities. The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.\n\nThe Arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region. The Arctic also holds 1/5 of the Earth's water supply.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Paleontology==\n[[File:Arctic fossils.jpg|Marine [[fossils]] in [[Canadian Arctic]]|thumb]]\nDuring the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous time period]], the Arctic still had seasonal snows, though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth.
