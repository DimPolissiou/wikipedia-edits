The [[educational system]] was further enlarged and elaborated. Elementary schools for senior students and institutions for advanced students. The formal education of the children usually begins at the age of six when they were admitted to elementary schools. The elementary schools were generally attached to the [[mosque]]s. At the elementary stage boys and girls read tighter. The curricula for the elementary schools included reading, writing, [[grammar]], traditions and arithmetic. After completing education in the mosque school, a student could seek admission to an educational institution meant for senior students. The syllabus of studies at such institutions included [[theology]], [[jurisprudence]], [[lexicography]], and [[literature]]. In the institutions for advanced studies the curricula included [[astronomy]], [[geometry]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], [[medicine]], and other studies. The Abbasid Caliph, [[Al-Ma'mun]], set up an academy known as Bait ul Hikma which served as an institution of higher learning. Under the [[Seljuks]], Minister [[Nizam-al-Mulk]] set up a [[University]] at [[Baghdad]] known as [[Nizamiyya|Nizamiyah]]. It was residential institution and scholars like [[Al-Ghazali|Imam Ghazali]] taught at this university. Later the Abbasid Caliph Mutansir set up another university at Bagdad known as the [[Mustansiriya University|Mustansiriyah]]. Numerous colleges were set up in various parts of the country. Some of the colleges in Khurasan and Persia were: Sadiyya, Bahaqiyya, Astrabadiyya, and Isfaranayya. One of the [[carving]]s on the Portals of these universities was that the world supported by four things: learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the religious and the valour of the brave.\n\nAs an adjunct to the process of [[education]], the Muslims set up [[Library|libraries]]. There were libraries attached to all educational institution. The Nizamiah university had four lakh books. The library at Ray had for hundred camel loads of books.\n[[Bukhara]] was one of the leading centres of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of [[Islamic culture]] were natives of the Central Asia who came to be known for their work during Abbasid rule in central Asia.\n\nFurthermore, scientists who were citizens of the [[Khilafah]] such as al-Khorezmi, Beruni, Farabi, Abu Ali ibn Sina brought fame to the area all over the world, generating respect across the world, and many scientific achievements of the period made a great impact on the European science. [[Al-Biruni]] (from Central Asia, 10th\u201311th centuries) is best known for his work of history, Chronology of Ancient Nations. He also wrote treatises on [[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[pharmacology]].\n\nJabir Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) developed an early scientific method in his Book of Optics (1021). The most important development of the [[scientific method]] was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of [[optics]], especially for his empirical proof of the [[intromission theory]] of light.\n\n[[Algebra]] was also pioneered by Persian Scientist Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b during this time in his landmark text, Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala, from which the term algebra is derived. He is thus considered to be the father of algebra. The terms [[algorism]] and [[algorithm]] are also derived from the name of al-Khwarizmi, who was responsible for introducing the [[Arabic numeral]]s and Hindu-Arabic numeral system beyond the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nMedicine was advanced particularly during the Abbasids' reign in Central Asia. During the ninth century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries in the understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[disease]]s were made. The clinical distinction between [[measles]] and [[smallpox]] was discovered during this time in Central Asia. Famous Persian scientist Ibn Sina produced thesis and works that summarized the vast amount of knowledge that scientists had accumulated, and is often known as the father of modern medicine for his [[encyclopaedia]]s, The Canon of Medicine and the Book of Healing. Some of his great works are: \u201cKitab Shifa al Nafs\u201d (The book the healing of the soul); \u201cKitab al Najat al Nafs\u201d (the book of the salvation of the soul); \u201cKitab al Isharat wal Tanbhihat\u201d (The book of the hints and the Warnings).\n\nTowards the end of 9th century, in Samarkand Al-Maturidi, a contemporary of Al Ash\u2019ari established a school of Rational Theology or Kalam, which sought to effect a compromise between [[orthodoxy]] and Mutazilism.\n\nIn the 10th Century Abu Nasr Muhammad Al Farabi produced a book Aara Ahl al Madinah al Fadila. (the Opinions of the Virtuous City), and Al Siyasat al Madaniyya (Political Regimes\u2019) he produced the concept of \u201cVirtuous City\u201d and \u201cFirst Chief\u201d.\n\nImam al Ghazali produced his classical work Ihya Ulum ul Din towards the end of 11th century.\n\nAbul Barkat Al Baghdadi was an eminent [[philosopher]] of the twelfth century. His principal book is Kitab ul Mutahar (The Book of that which has been established by personal reflections). He held that the space is three-dimensional and infinite. He defined time as the measure of being. He held that there is no distinction between intellect and soul.\n\nDuring [[Middle Ages]] the Muslims were the most advanced people in the world. While in Europe even the kings could not read and write, in the Muslim countries even the common man could read and write. According to Imam Abu Hanifah, the eminent [[jurist]], the purpose of education in Islam is the acquisition of [[Taqwa]]. Taqwa means the right conduct.\n\n\u201cEducation means the understanding of what makes or mars a soul, the acquisition of power and the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, between good and bad in regard to this and the next world, and the acquisition of the right and proper capacity to choose the right conduct to that the misguided intellect of man may not lead him astray.\u201d Indeed, no purpose of education could be nobler than that.\n\n==References==\n\n*The Abbasid Revolution: S.

As it featured a variety of old songs, it was the only Deluxe Edition by the band that did not include an alternate version of each song on the first disc. Some of the early booklets in the reissue had missing lyrics, which were made available on the Cure's website in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] form.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} All copies since contain the lyrics. A one-disc reissue was released on 5 September 2005, containing only the original album. It was also released in the standard jewel case rather than in a box.

It was later released in the United States, Canada, and Australia with a different track listing as a compilation album titled ''[[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure album)|Boys Don't Cry]]''.<ref>https://www.post-punk.com/the-cure-boys-dont-cry/</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n\n''Three Imaginary Boys'' was released on 8 May 1979 by record label Fiction. The record company decided which songs were put on the album, as well as the cover artwork, without [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]]'s consent. For all Cure albums since, Smith has ensured that he is given complete creative control over the final product before it goes on sale.<ref name=\"Apter\">{{cite book |last=Apter |first=Jeff |date=5 November 2009 |title=Never Enough: The Story of The Cure |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]}}</ref> The \"[[Foxy Lady]]\" [[soundcheck]], with vocals sung by [[Michael Dempsey]], was not supposed to be on the album, and was removed for the American release. Smith has stated that \"songs like 'Object' and 'World War' and our cover of 'Foxy Lady' were [Chris Parry's] choice\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2004 |title=<nowiki>[Article on the Cure]</nowiki> |journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]}}</ref>\n\nThe album was reissued on 29 November 2004 and featured a second disc of unreleased material, including songs recorded under the band name Easy Cure with [[Porl Thompson]]. It was originally supposed to be released in early 2004 along with the band's next three studio albums (''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'', ''[[Faith (The Cure album)|Faith]]'' and ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]''), but was delayed multiple times before being released by itself at the end of 2004. As it featured a variety of old songs, it was the only Deluxe Edition by the band that did not include an alternate version of each song on the first disc. Some of the early booklets in the reissue had missing lyrics, which were made available on the Cure's website in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] form.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} All copies since contain the lyrics. A one-disc reissue was released on 5 September 2005, containing only the original album. It was also released in the standard jewel case rather than in a box. In some countries, the Deluxe Edition has become a collector's item as production was phased out, being replaced by the more economic single-disc version.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"True\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/three-imaginary-boys-mw0000143449 |title=''Three Imaginary Boys'' \u2013 The Cure |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=28 January 2013 |last=True |first=Chris}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=3478 |title=The Cure: ''Three Imaginary Boys'' |journal=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=2 November 2015 |last=Wolk |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Wolk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127000110/http://blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=3478 |archivedate=27 November 2005}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev3score  = {{rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) |isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music }}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/dec/17/popandrock.shopping2 |title=The Cure, ''Three Imaginary Boys'' Deluxe Edition |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 December 2004 |accessdate=20 August 2016 |last=Sweeting |first=Adam}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev5score = 8.7/10<ref name=\"Abebe\">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1694-three-imaginary-boys-deluxe-edition/ |title=The Cure: ''Three Imaginary Boys'' [Deluxe Edition] |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=14 December 2004 |accessdate=28 January 2013 |last=Abebe |first=Nitsuh}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Cure |last=Sheffield |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Sheffield |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |year=2004 |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |isbn=978-0-7432-0169-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/205 205\u201306]|title-link=The Rolling Stone Album Guide }}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Smash Hits]]''\n| rev7score = 8/10<ref name=\"Starr\">{{cite journal |title=The Cure: Three Imaginary Boys (Polydor/Fiction) |journal=[[Smash Hits]] |date=28 June 1979 |last=Starr |first=Red |page=25}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"McCullough\">{{cite journal |title=Cure Pop for Now People |journal=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |date=12 December 1979 |last=McCullough |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Cure: Three Imaginary Boys |journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |issue= |date= |page=146 |quote=In 1978, The Cure, suburban teens indebted to punk, sounded fresh and unusual even then, penning unorthodox pop like 'Fire in Cairo'.}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDespite Smith's displeasure with the record, ''Three Imaginary Boys'' was well received critically at the time of its release.<ref name=\"Apter\"/> ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Dave McCullough praised it in a 5-star review and noted: \"The Cure are going somewhere different on each track, the ideas are startling and disarming.\" McCullough noted the variety of the material and qualified \"Grinding Halt\" as a \"pop song that reminds you of the [[Isley Brothers]] or the [[Buzzcocks]].\"<ref name=\"McCullough\"/> Red Starr, writing in ''[[Smash Hits]]'', described the album as a \"brilliant, compelling debut.\"<ref name=\"Starr\"/> However, ''[[NME]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Paul Morley]] did not share the same point of view and wrote: \"Most of the time, it's a voice catching its breath, a cautiously primitive riff guitar, toy drumming and a sprightly bass.\"<ref name=\"Morley\">{{cite journal |last=Morley |first=Paul |date=May 12, 1979 |title=A Cure for Cancer? |journal=[[NME]]}}</ref>\n\nChris True of [[AllMusic]] retrospectively called the album \"a very strong debut\" and a \"semi-detached bit of late-'70s English [[pop-punk]]\".<ref name=\"True\"/> Nitsuh Abebe of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' likened the album to a \"[[New wave music|new wave]] [[Wire (band)|Wire]]...
