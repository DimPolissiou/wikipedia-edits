However, the route already had an existing {{convert|609|mm|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} gauge human-powered tramway, which had been opened by the Chiba Prefectural government on 15 December 1912 to connect \u014chara and \u014ctaki. Local opposition and the deficit situation of the existing line delayed construction, which did not begin until 1925. The tramway was bought out by the [[Japanese Government Railways]] in 1927, and the first section of the new {{Nihongo|Kihara Line|\u6728\u539f\u7dda}} was opened on 1 April 1930. The line was extended to {{STN|Fusamoto}} by 25 August 1933 and to its present terminus at {{STN|Kazusa-Nakano}} on 26 August 1934.<ref name=\"terada2002\"/> As its name implies, the Kihara line was originally intended to connect \u014chara with [[Kisararu, Chiba|Kisarazu]]. However, it was never extended further than Kazusa-Nakano.\n\nIn 1954, the first JNR diesel railbus, the [[KiHa 01 series|KiHa 10000]], was introduced on the Kihara Line.<ref name=\"terada2002\"/> Four additional stations were added on 20 June 1960 ({{STN|Nishi-\u014chara}}, {{STN|Nittano}}, {{STN|Koyamatsu}}, and {{STN|Kugahara|Chiba}}). However, on 4 September 1968 the line was listed as one of 83 money-losing local lines recommended for closure. The line problems were compounded in the summer of 1970, when heavy rains washed out a portion of the track, causing a suspension of operations from 1 July through 1 October.

However, the route already had an existing {{convert|609|mm|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} gauge human-powered tramway, which had been opened by the Chiba Prefectural government on 15 December 1912 to connect \u014chara and \u014ctaki. Local opposition and the deficit situation of the existing line delayed construction, which did not begin until 1925. The tramway was bought out by the [[Japanese Government Railways]] in 1927, and the first section of the new {{Nihongo|Kihara Line|\u6728\u539f\u7dda}} was opened on 1 April 1930. The line was extended to {{STN|Fusamoto}} by 25 August 1933 and to its present terminus at {{STN|Kazusa-Nakano}} on 26 August 1934.<ref name=\"terada2002\"/> As its name implies, the Kihara line was originally intended to connect \u014chara with [[Kisararu, Chiba|Kisarazu]]. However, it was never extended further than Kazusa-Nakano.\n\nIn 1954, the first JNR diesel railbus, the [[KiHa 01 series|KiHa 10000]], was introduced on the Kihara Line.<ref name=\"terada2002\"/> Four additional stations were added on 20 June 1960 ({{STN|Nishi-\u014chara}}, {{STN|Nittano}}, {{STN|Koyamatsu}}, and {{STN|Kugahara|Chiba}}). However, on 4 September 1968 the line was listed as one of 83 money-losing local lines recommended for closure. The line problems were compounded in the summer of 1970, when heavy rains washed out a portion of the track, causing a suspension of operations from 1 July through 1 October. Scheduled freight operations were suspended from 1 October 1974. On 18 September 1981, the line was again recommended for closure.<ref name=\"terada2002\"/>\n\nAfter the breakup and privatization of the JNR on 1 April 1987, the line came under the control of the JR East.  \n\nThe Isumi Line came into being on 24 March 1988 following the transfer of the assets of the former Kihara Line to the newly formed [[Public\u2013private partnership|third sector]] operator Isumi Railway Company.<ref name=\"terada2002\">{{cite book| last = Terada| first = Hirokazu |script-title=ja: \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u79c1\u9244 |trans-title=Databook: Japan's Private Railways| publisher = Neko Publishing| date = July 2002| location = Japan| isbn = 978-4-87366-874-1| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RH3FXwAACAAJ | title = \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u79c1\u9244: \u5168\u56fd\u79c1\u9244149\u793e\u5c40\u63b2\u8f09 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isumi Railway has attempted to increase revenues by selling [[naming rights]] to stations to local industries, leading to some confusion on the correct station names.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Isumi Railway}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.isumirail.co.jp/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2010}}\n[[Category:Railway lines in Japan]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Chiba Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1930]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n[[Category:Japanese third-sector railway lines]]\n[[Category:Railway companies of Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor nitpicking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isumi_Line"}

However, the language also displays complex processes of [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] alternation, segmental [[Allophone|allophony]], and interaction between segmental and [[Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental]] phonology.\n\n== Setting ==\nThe Arara people speak this language, also formally known as [[Arara (Par\u00e1)|Arara]] but had to be changed in the late 1980s so the language could be distinguished from other languages in the Arara branch by similar Brazilian groups. At one point, Ntogapid, Ramarama, Uruku, Urumi and Ytanga were all thought to be sister languages of Karo.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Karo|title=Karo - Indigenous Peoples of Brazil|last=Gabas|first=Nilson|date=|website=Povos Ind\u00edgenas No Brasil|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After further study, it was determined that they were all the same language that was classified as different languages during various ethnology work in Brazil. The Karo language is spoken in two villages in Brazil; Iterap and Paygap. These villages are located in the Southern region of the Lourdes Stream Indigenous Land in [[Rond\u00f4nia]], which is in the central west part of Brazil.\n\n[[Denny Moore]]'s 2006 summary of indigenous language vitality in Brazil documents that there the Arara people have a population of 184, with most of the population speaking the language and a good transmission rate of the language between generations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Denny|date=|title=Brazil: Language Situation|url=|journal=The Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics|volume=|pages=117\u2013128|via=}}</ref> Although [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is taught as a second language for contact purposes, the native language is still used for many occasions in daily life.

As a result, their culture has suffered tremendously to the point where it almost disappeared.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some cultural traditions included a corn harvest festival and secluding children until the time they got married. Although their culture has suffered, many traditions such as rites of passages for marriage and naming children have stayed similar. Other traditions have stayed consistent such as their material culture. The Karo people have a deep history of creating many forms of art such as bracelets, baskets, or clay pots. Furthermore, the Karo speakers were known to interact with surrounding peoples in the areas but it was not until the 1940s when they were contacted by the [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio|Indian Protection Services]] (SPI).<ref name=\":0\" /> Settlers brought over new diseases such as pneumonia, measles and the flu which lead to many indigenous people dying in this time period. Luckily, in the 1960s the Arara people regrouped with a nearby people known as the [[Gavi\u00e3o (G\u00ea)|Gavi\u00e3o]] where they eventually grew in size.<ref name=\":0\" /> By the mid-1980s, the group was able to find their own village and get federal recognition from local groups.\n\nWhile the Arara people were severely affected by the colonizers who brought many diseases to their people, there is no documentation on conflicts amongst the colonizers. However, there is documentation of conflicts between two groups of Arara. This conflict was between the main group and another group called the \u201cBlack Feet\u201d who spoke a different dialect of the language.<ref name=\":0\" /> The groups often got along but there are documentations of conflicts between the two which turned so violent that some lead in death. Moreover, there are no written material on schools for the Karo people. Most people in the village do speak Arara and Portuguese so it is very likely that most of these community members went to schools outside their village.\n\n=== Documentation ===\nThe earliest documentation of the Karo language was published by [[Germany|German]] ethnographer [[Curt Nimuendaj\u00fa|Curt Nimuendaju]] who produced three wordlists from 1925 to 1955, though he referred to the language as Ntogap\u00edd.<ref name=\":3\">Gabas Jr., ''Genetic relationship within the Ramar\u00e1ma family of the Tup\u00ed stock (Brazil)''</ref><ref>Nimuendaj\u00fa, Curt, \u201cAs Tribus do Alto Madeira.\u201d ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Am\u00e9ricanistes''XVII (1925): 137-172.</ref><ref>Nimuendaj\u00fa, Curt, \u201cWortlisten aus Amazonien.\u201d ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Am\u00e9ricanistes''XXIV (1932): 93-119.</ref><ref>Nimuendaj\u00fa, Curt, \u201cReconhecimento dos rios I\u00e7\u00e1na, Ayar\u00ed, e Uaup\u00e9s, mar\u00e7o a julho de 1927: Apontamentos lingu\u00edsticos,\u201d ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Am\u00e9ricanistes''44 (1955): 149-178.</ref> Several additional wordlists of Karo, listed under different names, were published during the twentieth century as the Karo people came into greater contact with outside groups.<ref name=\":3\" /> These lists were collected by a variety of people for different aims\u2014a few by anthropologists and ethnographers, one commissioned by a Catholic priest and some by members of the Comiss\u00e3o de Linhas Telegr\u00e1ficas Estrat\u00e9gicas de Mato-Grosso ao Amazonas (Commission of Strategic Telegraphic Wires from Mato-Grosso to Amazonas) who aimed to expand the Western borders of Brazil in the mid-nineteenth century.<ref name=\":3\" /> In the twentieth century, two further wordlists have been published, one by Ruth Fonini Monserrat in the year 2000<ref>Monserrat, Ruth Fonini, ''Vocabul\u00e1rio Amondawa-Portugu\u00eas, [etc.],'' Caixas do Sul: Universidade do Caixas do Sul, 2000.</ref> and the other through a 2004 language documentation project by Nilsen Gabas Jr.<ref name=\":4\">\u201cDocumentation and Description of Karo, Brazil,\u201d ''Endangered Language Archive at SOAS University of London'', <nowiki>http://elar.soas.ac.uk/desposit/0206</nowiki></ref>\n\nThe majority of detailed linguistic descriptions completed on the Karo language was done by Gabas Jr. who wrote his master's thesis on the [[phonology]] of Karo before going on to specialize in the language.<ref>Gabas, Jr., Nilson.

The only substantial material published containing a small description of the life of the Arara can be found in anthropological works by French anthropologist, [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|L\u00e9vi-Strauss]].\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe Karo language belongs to the Tup\u00ed stock of Brazilian Indigenous languages which includes up to 10 language families\u2014Karo in particular is a member of the [[Ramarama languages|Ramar\u00e1ma]] family.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1964 [[Aryon Rodrigues|Aryon Dall\u2019Igna Rodrigues]] published a classification of the Tup\u00ed stock that placed four languages within the Ramar\u00e1ma family: Ramar\u00e1ma, Uruk\u00fa, Urum\u00ed and Karo.<ref>Rodrigues, Aryon Dall'Igna, Arnaldo Hauptmann, and Thekla Hartmann, \"A CLASSIFICA\u00c7\u00c3O DO TRONCO LING\u00dc\u00cdSTICO TUP\u00cd,\" ''Revista De Antropologia''12, no. 1/2 (1964): 103, {{jstor|41615767}}</ref> However, in 2000, Gabas Jr released a detailed comparative analysis of the wordlists published in those languages that challenged these assumptions and concluded that the only language in the Ramar\u00e1ma language family is Karo.<ref>Gabas Jr., Nilson, \"Genetic relationship within the Ramar\u00e1ma family of the Tup\u00ed stock (Brazil),\" ''Indigenous languages of lowland South America''(2000): 80-82,<nowiki>http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/illa:vol1n6/illa_vol1n6_gabas.pdf</nowiki></ref> It has been proposed that Karo and another Tup\u00ed language [[Purubora language|Purubor\u00e1]] are both part of a singular Ramar\u00e1ma-Purubor\u00e1 language family, however this is controversial. A joint 2015 computational study comparing common word lists in all Tup\u00ed languages found minimal support for that theory.<ref>Ana Vilacy Galucio & al., \u201cGenealogical relations and lexical distances within the Tupian linguistic family,\u201d ''Boletim do Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi.

The permissible structures of a monosyllable are therefore V, CV, VC, and CVC. However, only the glottal stop /\u0294/ can occur as a non-word-final coda consonant. Hence the permissible structures of a polysyllabic word is as follows: ...(C)V(\u0294)(C)V(C). Words of more than three syllables are rare.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nRamarama has a fairly small consonant inventory, with a wide range of allophonic variation. Notably, the language lacks any fricatives other than /h/, which itself occurs only infrequently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Karo, Tupi (Brazil)|last=Gabas|first=Nilson Jr.|publisher=University of California|year=1999|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Stop consonant|'''Stop''']]\n|[[Voicelessness|Voiceless]]\n|p\n|t\n|c\n|k\n|\u0294\n|-\n|[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]]\n|b\n|r\n|\n|g\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|'''Nasal''']]\n|m\n|n\n|\n|\u014b\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|'''Fricative''']]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|h\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|'''Approximant''']]\n|w\n|\n|j <y>\n|\n|\n|}\nThe tap /r/, though not phonetically a stop, is represented as such because it patterns as the voiced equivalent of the stop /t/. This may indicate a historical [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].\n\n==== Allophony ====\nThe voiced stops /b g/ may be [[Lenition|lenited]] to [\u03b2 \u0263] in the onset of an unstressed syllable and after a vowel: ''yaba'' [\u02c8yaba ~ \u02c8ya\u03b2a] \"species of rodent\". The palatal stop /c/ may be lenited to [\u00e7] in all circumstances ([[free variation]]).\n\nThe voiceless stops /p t c k/ are [[Gemination|geminated]] in the onsets of non-initial stressed syllables: ''it\u0268'' [i\u02c8t\u02d0\u0268] \"deer\". They are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]] in the coda of a word-final syllable: ''makap'' [ma\u02c8k\u02d0ap\u031a] \"peanut\".\n\nNasal stops /m n \u014b/ surface as post-stopped nasals [m\u1d47 n\u1d48 \u014b\u1da2] in the onsets of stressed oral syllables: ''na\u0294mi'' [na\u0294\u02c8m\u1d47i]  \"species of wasp\". Conversely, they surface as ''pre''-stopped nasals [\u1d47m \u1d48n \u1da2\u014b] in the codas of stressed oral syllables: ''ken'' [k\u025b\u1d48n] \"to sleep\".\n\nThe [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] /w j/ are nasalized [w\u0303 \u0237\u0303] before nasal vowels. The [[Flap consonant|tap]] /r/ is nasalized [r\u0303] only between two nasal vowels, when the first vowel is stressed (as in the process of nasal spreading discussed below).\n\n=== Vowels ===\nRamarama has a large vowel inventory, with seven oral and four nasal vowels:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Central vowel|Central]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n|'''[[Close vowel|High]]'''\n|i \u0129\n|\u0268\n|u\n|-\n|'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''\n|e \u1ebd\n|\u0259\n|o \u00f5\n|-\n|'''[[Open vowel|Low]]'''\n|\n|a \u00e3\n|\n|}\nThe mid oral vowels /e o/ alternate with low-mid [\u025b \u0254]: syllables with high pitch surface with [e o], while unstressed syllables or those with mid pitch surface with [\u025b \u0254]. Such interaction between tone and vowel quality is cross-linguistically rare.<ref>Gabas, Nilson Jr. (1999), p. 17.</ref>\n\nNasal vowels have a restricted distribution. Nilson Gabas Jr. (1999) writes that \"there seems to be just one underlying nasal vowel per word\",<ref>Gabas, Nilson Jr. (1999), p. 33.</ref> yet transcribes several examples with more than one nasal vowel that nasal spreading cannot account for (e.g. ''m\u00e3yg\u00e3ra'' \"snake\"); this may indicate a nasal spreading rule as yet undescribed, or a freer distribution of nasal vowels than indicated. In any case, nasal vowels also never occur in a penultimate syllable when followed by a voiceless stop in the onset of the final syllable; in other words, sequences of the format /\u1e7cC<sup>-VOICE</sup>V#/ are disallowed, presumably because such sequences would create a conflict in stress assignment.\n\n==== Nasal spreading ====\nLike many languages with phonemic nasal vowels, Ramarama displays nasal spreading (nasalization of otherwise non-nasal segments due to proximity to a nasal segment) in some circumstances.\n\nObligatory rightward nasal spreading occurs when a stressed penultimate nasal vowel is followed by the consonants /r g/ as the onset of a following oral syllable. The following syllable is thus nasalized, and with it the onset consonants (which become [r\u0303 \u014b]): ''c\u1ebdrat'' /\u02c8c\u1ebdrat/ \"smooth\" surfaces as [\u02c8c\u1ebdr\u0303\u0259\u0303t\u031a].\n\nAn optional ''in''ward nasal spreading occurs when an oral vowel occurs between two nasal consonants. The vowel may then be nasalized: ''anana'' /anana/ \"pineapple\" may become [an\u0259\u0303\u02c8n\u1d48a].\n\n=== Stress ===\nStress is not phonemic in Ramarama, and its placement is mostly fixed to the final syllable. However, the following rules can move stress to the penultimate syllable:\n\n# If the final syllable's onset is one of the voiced consonants /b r g/, stress is shifted to the penult: ''yogo'' \"eel\" surfaces as [\u02c8j\u0254g\u0254], not *[j\u0254\u02c8g\u0254].\n# Syllables with nasal nuclei, whether beginning with a voiced stop or not, are automatically stressed: ''\u0129ya'' \"bird\" surfaces as [\u02c8\u0129ja], while ''cig\u00e3'' \"bone\" surfaces as [ci\u02c8g\u00e3].\n# Syllables with high pitch, whether beginning with a voiced stop or not, are likewise automatically stressed: ''w\u00edup'' \"native, non-domesticated\" surfaces as [\u02c8w\u00ed.up\u031a], while ''yog\u00e1'' \"egg\" surfaces as [j\u0254\u02c8g\u00e1]\n\n=== Tone ===\nRamarama has a simple system of register [[Pitch accent (intonation)|pitch accent]], in which one syllable per word (the penultimate or final) can be marked by a high pitch. A syllable thus marked is always stressed. Stressed vowels ''without'' marked pitch surface phonetically as middle pitch, while unstressed vowels (except those affected by tone spreading) surface as low pitch: ''parato'' \"armadillo\" may be represented phonetically as [p\u00e0r\u00e0\u02c8t\u02d0\u014d], while ''nak\u00e1'' \"head\" may be represented as [n\u00e0\u02c8k\u02d0\u00e1].\n\nTone spreading occurs when a syllable marked with high or mid pitch occurs in the penultimate syllable and is followed by a voiced segment /b r g w j m n \u014b/ or /\u00d8/; hence ''k\u00e1wan'' \"be fat\" surfaces as [k\u00e1w\u00e1n], while ''yaba'' \"species of rodent\" surfaces as [\u02c8j\u0101b\u0101]. This process, roughly analogous to the obligatory nasal spreading rule, appears to be the only means by which unstressed syllables can be raised to high or mid pitch.\n\n=== Sandhi ===\nIn continuous speech Ramarama's small consonant inventory is further reduced, and simultaneously complicated, by complex morphophonological processes of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] ([[sandhi]]). These processes affect the voiceless stops /p t k/ as follows:\n\n# /p t k/ voice to /b r g/ at word boundaries, before (if in the coda of the preceding word) or after (if in the onset of the following word) a vowel or a glide. Thus ''cawap w\u0268y'' \"the sun rose\" surfaces as ''cawa'''b''' w\u0268y'', while ''\u00f3ra pec\u00e9p'' \"[an] ugly song\" surfaces as ''\u00f3ra '''b'''ec\u00e9p.''\n# /p k/ voice to /b g/ in word-final codas if followed by an unstressed word-initial nasal consonant: ''wakak nak\u00e1'' \"[a] bird's head\" surfaces as ''waga'''g''' nak\u00e1''. If followed by a ''stressed'' vowel, /k/ still voices but /p/ changes to [h]: ''na\u0294yop n\u00f5'' \"one of the leaves\" surfaces as ''na\u0294yo'''h''' n\u00f5''.\n# /p t k/ nasalize to /m n \u014b/ word-initially when preceded by a nasal consonant, and word-finally when followed by a nasal consonant '''and''' preceded by a nasal vowel. Thus ''o=ku\u014b k\u0268t'' \"my white belly\" surfaces as ''oku\u014b '''\u014b'''\u0268t'', while ''n\u00e3p nak\u00e1'' \"[a] bee's head\" surfaces as ''n\u00e3'''m''' nak\u00e1.''\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe morphology of Karo consists of different morphological properties including [[word class]]es, [[affix]]es, [[clitic]]s, [[nominalization]]s, and [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]. It is a mildly [[Synthetic language|synthetic]]-[[fusional language]].<ref>Gabas, Nilson, Jr. \"A Grammar of Karo, Tup\u00ed (Brazil): A Dissertation Submitted in Partial Satisfaction of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Linguistics.\" September 23, 1999: 38-94.</ref> Word classes contain morphemes such as [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, etc. \u2014 Karo contains a total of nine word classes. Karo has a class of pronouns which include four different types: [[Personal pronoun|personal]], [[Possessive pronoun|possessive]], [[Interrogative Pronoun|interrogative]], and [[demonstrative]]. [[Noun]]s are their own class in Karo though they are not inflected for [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[Grammatical case|case]]. They can be combined with clitics and modified by adjectives. The verb class in the language are typically sentence-final and are distinctly categorized into [[Transitive verb|transitive]] and [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] categories. [[Auxiliary verb|Auxiliary]] class words are similar to intransitive verbs in English, but with little lexical meaning. In Karo, adjectives are considered an [[Open class (linguistics)|open class]], meaning they accepts the addition of any new words, and usually appear following the head noun in a [[noun phrase]]. [[Adverb]]s, unlike adjectives, typically appear at the end or beginning of a [[clause]] and are a closed class though manner adverbials, which derive from adjectives and include numerals, are open class. [[Preposition and postposition|Postpositions]] form their own phrases and contribute to the sentence as [[Argument (linguistics)|oblique arguments]]. [[Grammatical particle|Particles]] in Karo, like with many other languages, are defined negatively because they are defined by not being part of any other word class. In Karo, particles are similar to adverbs but less cohesively defined. Finally, the most complex class in Karo is [[ideophone]]s. Semantically similar to verbs, and morphologically similar to the particles, ideophones are an open class that are not inflectionally marked.\n\nAffixes form morphological processes. There are three inflectional suffixes exist in Karo:''-t'' the first [[Realis mood|indicative]],''-p'' the second indicative, and ''-a''the [[gerund]] suffix. In addition, the language contains only six derivational prefixes, five which have specific functions: ''ma-'' the [[Causative|simple causative]], ''ta-'' the [[Comitative case|comitative causative]], ''pe-'' the [[Impersonal passive voice|impersonal passive]], ''to-'' the [[Reciprocal pronoun|reciprocal]],''m\u00e3'' ''m-'' the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]. The remaining one ''pe'' \u0294''-'' is an [[Optative mood|optative]]. Karo is also known for its use of clitics, which are affixes by their distribution. Clitics in this language are typically found within larger constituents than words and Karo in fact contains four: plural marker ''=to'' \u0294'','' adverbializer =''tem'', a set of personal markers and nominalizer ''ko=.'' Lastly, compounding in Karo is quite popular and most [[morpheme]] compounds consist of noun + adjective, noun + intransitive verb and noun + noun pairs. All of these elements together compile the basic elements of Karo morphology.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nBelow are tables listing of the [[Personal pronoun|personal]] and [[possessive]] pronouns as well as the personal clitics. Personal pronouns are used in [[Ergative case|ergative]] or [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] arguments of transitive verbs. The [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], or [[Accusative case|object]], pronouns has as separate system of personal clitics which are marked for the argument of intransitive sentences and the patient arguments of transitive sentences. The possessive pronouns are used with alienable nouns. Additionally, there are also the [[Interrogative Pronoun|interrogative]] pronouns ''n''\u00e3''n'' \u2018who, what\u2019, ''k\u0268gom\u0259t'' \u2018which\u2019, and the [[demonstrative]] pronouns ''y\u00e9t'' \u2018that (close to speaker)\u2019, ''t\u0259t'' \u2018that (close to hearer)\u2019 and ''yeket'' \u2018that (far from both)'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 3 - Personal Pronouns<ref name=\":5\">Gabas, 39.</ref>\n!\n!First Person\n!Second Person\n!Third Person\n![[Feminine gender|Third Person Feminine]]\n|-\n|[[Singular number|Singular]]\n|\u00f5n\n|\u1ebdn\n|at\n|\u014ba\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Inclusive)]]\n|i\u0294t\u0259\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ka\u0294to\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |tap\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Exclusive)]]\n|t\u00e9\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 4 - Referential Clitics<ref>Gabas, 81</ref>\n!\n!First Person\n!Second Person\n!Third Person\n![[Feminine gender|Third Person Feminine]]\n|-\n|[[Singular number|Singular]]\n|o=\n|e=\n|a\u0294=\n|\u014ba=\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Inclusive)]]\n|i\u0294=\n| rowspan=\"2\" |karo=\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |tap=\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Exclusive)]]\n|t\u00e9=\n|-\n|IND1EF\n| colspan=\"4\" |i=\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 5 - Possessive Pronouns<ref name=\":5\" />\n!\n!First Person\n!Second Person\n!Third Person\n![[Feminine gender|Third Person Feminine]]\n|-\n|[[Singular number|Singular]]\n|wat\n|et\n|at\n|\u014baat\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Inclusive)]]\n|i\u0294yat\n| rowspan=\"2\" |karowat\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |tabat\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Exclusive)]]\n|te\u0294et\n|-\n|IND1EF\n| colspan=\"4\" |yat=\n|}\n''Examples of pronoun use''<ref>Gabas, 40</ref><ref>Gabas, 43</ref><ref name=\":7\">Gabas, 46</ref><ref name=\":7\" /><ref>Gabas, 44</ref><ref>Gabas, 56</ref><ref>Gabas, 82</ref><ref>Gabas, 83</ref>\n\n'''''n\u00e3n   \u1ebdn'''      i=top''\n\n'''who 2sg'''   3imp=see\n\n'Who/what did you see?\u2019\n\n'''''wat'''             ka\u0294a''\n\n'''1sg.poss'''   house\n\n\u2018My house\u2019\n\n'''''\u014ba'''=w\u00e9-t''\n\n'''3sg.fem'''=cry-ind1\n\n\u2018She cried.\u2019\n\n'''''tap'''=peri-t''\n\n'''3pl'''=cry-ind1\n\n\u2018They cried.\u2019\n\n'''''i\u0294t\u0259'''         tap''\n\n'''1pl.incl'''   assoc\n\n\u2018ours (things), us\u2019\n\n''caropap=tem   '''ka\u0294to'''   karo=k\u00f5na''\n\nsad=advz        '''2pl'''        2pl=emph\n\n\u2018You (pl.) are sad.\u2019\n\nameko   '''o='''top-t\n\njaguar    '''1sg='''see-ind1\n\n'The jaguar saw me.'\n\n'''a''\u0294='''''<nowiki/>''ken-1''\n\n'''3sg='''sleep-ind1\n\n'He slept.'\n\n=== Indicatives ===\nThe two [[Realis mood|indicative]] Karo suffixes, ''-t'', ''-p'' have a fine distinction between them. The term \u2018indicative\u2019 in the case of Karo is used for lack of a better label and is split into (ind1) ''-t'' and (ind2) ''-p.'' They have many similarities. Like all the inflectional suffixes, they can only join at the end of verb, auxiliary and [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] predicates. In addition, both are used to represent the main statement within a clause. The only difference is the type of statement clauses that they occur in. The first indicative ''-t'' is used that are in [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] position. It can appear [[allomorph]]ically after nasal vowels are ''/-n/''. Conversely, the second indicative ''-p'' only appears when one phrase has been moved into focus position. This suffix can appear as ''/-ap/'' after consonants or ''/-m/'' after nasal vowels.\n\n''Examples of first and second indicative suffixes''<ref name=\":8\">Gabas, 57</ref><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Gabas, 60</ref><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n''\u00f5n m\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u0129-'''n'''        t\u0259gana pe\u0294''\n\n1sg snake kill'''-ind1'''   there loc\n\n\u2018I killed the snake there.\u2019\n\n''at to=wirup   \u0294o'''-t'''           c\u00fa-tem''\n\n3sg 3r=food eat'''-ind1'''   big=advz\n\n\u2018He ate his own food a lot.\u2019\n\n''t\u0259gana pe\u0294   \u00f5n m\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u0129-'''m'''''\n\nthere loc 1sg snake kill-'''ind2'''\n\n\u2018It was there that I killed the snake.\u2019\n\n''c\u00fa=tem at to=wirup   \u0294o-'''p'''''\n\nbig=advs 3sg 3r=food eat-'''ind2'''\n\n\u2018A lot, he ate his own food.\u2019\n\n=== Nominalization ===\nEntire verbs, verb phrases, and clauses in Karo can be transformed into nouns through three manners: the suffix -''ap,'' the particle ''kan\u00e3'' and the clitic ''ko=.'' The suffix -''ap'' takes transitive and intransitive verbs and yield [[Agent (grammar)|agentive]] nominals. It is the only form of nominalization in Karo that does not also utilize the non finite indicating gerund suffix -''a.'' These types of verbs can also be turned into place nouns with the particle ''kan\u00e3.'' This particle can also be used with the absolutive argument form of \u2018to like\u2019 to form actions. The nominalizing clitic ''ko='' works in conjunction with the absolutive argument of  \u2018to perceive\u2019 to transform whole clauses into nouns.\n\n''Examples of nominalization''<ref>Gabas, 86</ref><ref name=\":10\">Gabas, 87</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>Gabas, 89</ref>\n\n''\u0294o-'''p'''''\n\neat-'''nomz'''\n\n\u2018eater\u2019\n\n''o=ker-a             '''  kan\u00e3'''''\n\n1sg=sleep-ger    '''nomz'''\n\n\u2018My place to sleep.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n a\u0294=w\u0129-a '''       kan\u00e3'''    ya\u0294ti\tn\u00e3-n''\n\n1sg 3sg=kill-ger   '''nomz'''   like\tcop-ind1\n\n\u2018I like to kill it.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n am\u0251an at-a        '''ko'''=top-t''\n\n1sg rain fall-ger   '''nomz'''=see-ind1\n\n\u2018I saw the rain falling.'\n\n== Syntax ==\nKaro generally follows a relatively strict [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|Subject-Object-Verb]] (SOV) sentence structure, unless one aspect of the sentence is being focused on.<ref name=\":6\">Gabas, viii.</ref> It does not mark for case on nouns, but like many Tupi languages, it follows an [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]] marking system for pronouns.<ref name=\":6\" /> Karo possesses a system made up of five distinct prefixes all with [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] affecting properties.\n\n=== Valency<ref>Gabas, 63-71</ref> ===\nKaro has five derivational prefixes that appear on a verb and change the number of arguments in the a sentence constructions. The five prefixes are as follows: ''ma''- the simple [[causative]], ''ta''- the [[Comitative case|comitative]] causative, ''pe''- the [[Impersonal passive voice|impersonal passive]], ''to-'' the [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]], and ''m\u00e3m''- the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]].\n\nWith the simple causative, an argument is added. It appears most often with intransitive verbs to indicate an initiator who causes a secondary agent who performs or experiences an action or state.\n\n''Examples of the simple causative''<ref name=\":11\">Gabas, 63</ref><ref name=\":11\" /><ref>bas, 64a</ref>\n\n''\u00f5n amaken''\n\n''\u00f5n a\u0294='''ma-'''ket-t''\n\n1sg 3sg='''caus-'''sleep-ind1\n\n\u2018I made it/him sleep.\u2019\n\n''\u014ba omacop\u0268n''\n\n''\u014ba o='''ma-'''cop\u0268t-t''\n\n3sg.fem 1sg='''caus-'''be.fat-ind1\n\n\u2018She made me fat.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n amap\u0259ri''\n\n''\u00f5n a\u0294='''ma'''-p\u0259r\u0259p=t''\n\n1sg 3sg='''caus-'''empty-ind1\n\n\u2018I emptied it.\u201d\n\nThe comitative causative also occurs mainly with the intransitive but does appear on occasion with transitive verbs. Like the simple causative it indicates an initiator who causes a secondary agent to perform or experience an action or state, but additionally indicates that the initiator is also performing or experiencing that action or state.\n\n''Examples of the comitative causative''<ref>Gabas, 65</ref><ref>Gabas, 66</ref><ref>Gabas, 67</ref>\n\n''wat ow\u00e3        orak\u0259t''\n\n''wat ow\u00e3       o='''ta-'''k\u0259-t''\n\n1sg.poss mother 1sg='''com-'''walk-INDI\n\n\u2018My mother made me walk, walking with me.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n wat ow\u1ebd\u0301    raken''\n\n''\u00f5n wat ow\u1ebd\u0301     '''ta-'''ket-t''\n\n1sg 1sg.poss baby   '''com-'''sleep-ind1\n\n\u2018I put my baby to sleep, sleeping with it.\u2019\n\n''c\u00e3n nak\u0259ga''\n\n''c\u00e3n   '''ta-'''k\u0259k-a''\n\ncat    '''com-'''walk-ger\n\n\u2018Walk the cat!\u2019\n\nThe impersonal passive reduces the number of arguments with transitive sentence constructions. It makes the appearance of any agents in the sentence [[Grammaticality|ungrammatical]].\n\n''Examples of the impersonal passive''<ref>Gabas, 68</ref><ref name=\":12\">Gabas, 69</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\n''oy\u00e3y beme\u014b\u00e3n''\n\n''o=y\u00e3y         '''pe-'''me\u014b\u00e3-n''\n\n1sg=tooth   '''ipass-'''be.dirty.ind1\n\n\u2018My tooth got dirty.\u2019\n\n''c\u0129m mema\u0294waba''\n\n''c\u0129m     '''pe-'''ma\u0294wap-a''\n\nmeat   '''ipass'''-fry-ger\n\n\u2018The meat got fried.\u2019\n\n''abegahm\u014dm n\u00e3''\n\n''a\u0294='''pe'''-kahm\u014dm n\u00e3-a''\n\n3sg='''ipass'''-be.quiet cop-ger\n\n\u2018It got quiet/calmed down.\u2019\n\nAnother valency-reducing prefix in Karo is the reflexive which can be used in both transitive and intransitive verb constructions. With transitives, the reflexive is preceded by a [[coreferential]] personal clinic relating it to the subject clause. However, with intransitives, the reflexive and clitic are attached to the [[Dative case|dative]] marker.\n\n''Examples of the reflexive''<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\">Gabas, 70</ref><ref name=\":13\" />\n\n''\u00f5n om\u00e3mnoy''\n\n''\u00f5n o='''m\u00e3m-'''top-t''\n\n1sg 1sg='''refl-'''see-ind1\n\n\u2018I saw myself.\u2019\n\n''at tom\u00e3mw\u0129n''\n\n''at to='''m\u00e3m-'''w\u0129-n''\n\n3sg 3r='''refl-'''kill-ind1\n\n\u2018He/it killed him/itself.\u2019\n\n''owak\u00e1n om\u00e3mk\u0259y''\n\n''o=wak\u00e1-n o='''m\u00e3m'''-k\u0259y''\n\n1sg=be.angry-ind1 1sg='''refl-'''dat\n\n\u2018I am angry at myself.\u2019\n\nFinally, the reciprocal prefix is also considered to be valency-reducing and attaches itself to the root of transitive verbs. Like the reflexive, it is always preceded by a coreferential personal clitic that relates to the subject of the clause.\n\n''Examples of the reciprocal''<ref name=\":13\" /><ref>Gabas, 71</ref>\n\n''tap toroyap\u00edt''\n\n''tap to='''ro-'''yap\u00ed-t''\n\n3pl 3r-'''rec-'''kill-ind1\n\n\u2018They killed each other.\u2019\n\n''ka\u0294to karorocap\u00e9t ahy\u0259''\n\n''ka\u0294to karo='''ro-'''cap\u00e9-t ahy\u0259''\n\n2pl 2pl='''rec-'''beat-ind1 interr\n\n\u2018Did you beat each other?\u2019\n\n== Semantics<ref>Gabas, 137-144</ref> ==\nTense in Karo is marked analytically. [[Analytic language]]s are characterized by unbound morphemes or syntactical constructions. Both [[Past tense|past]] and [[Future tense|future]] tenses are marked by two particles, but future tense also utilizes one auxiliary. However, it is important to note that these markers are not necessary for the language.\n\n=== Past Tense ===\nThere are two particles in Karo. In Karo, particles are used in the past tense to refer to an action or state with the present as a point of reference. These two particles are ''co'' and ''k\u00e1n. Co'' refers to actions in the recent or simple past while ''k\u00e1n'' is used for actions that happened a long time ago or past events that relate to myths. Below are examples of ''co'' and ''k\u00e1n'' used in everyday Karo language.\n\n''Example of co''<ref>Gabas, 137</ref>\n\n''p\u00fa\u014b      wet                  '''co'''''\n\n''p\u00fa\u014b      o=\u0294e-t              '''co'''''\n\nshoot 1sg=aux-ind1   '''past'''\n\n'''\u2018'''I shot.\u2019\n\nIn this example, the verb \u201cto shoot\u201d is simple since it only contains a subject and a simple verb. It indicates that the shooting that has been done was recent. Conversely, the particle ''k\u00e1n'' is used in the far past.\n\n''Example of k\u00e1n''<ref name=\":14\">Gabas, 138</ref>\n\n'''''<nowiki/>'''''\n\n''toto obet\u00f5       '''m[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]<nowiki/>y'''            '''m\u00e3m   \u014b\u00e1n'''''\n\n''toto obet\u00f5       '''m\u026by'''            '''m\u00e3m k\u00e1n'''''\n\ngrandfather 3imp-tell  ''' long.ago x         rpast'''\n\n\u2018It was grandfather who told (the story) long ago.\u2019\n\nIn this example, this particle is only used when describing incidents in the far past. Unlike ''k\u00e1n'', ''co'' can also be used to indicate future occurrences with reference to the past. Here are a few examples of when the future tense uses ''co'' and the auxiliaries ''kap'' and ''yat.''\n\n''Example of co with future tense''<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n''war ic[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]       \u0294ara           '''okay co'''''\n\n''wat ic[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]       \u0294at-a          '''o=kap-t co'''''\n\n1sg.poss water bring-ger 1sg='''aux.fut-ind1'''   '''past'''\n\n'''\u2018'''I was going to bring my water.\u2019\n\n''iy\u00f5m      '''ikap'''                           towenaoba         '''co'''''\n\n''iy\u00f5m      '''i=kap=ap'''                   to=penaop-a      '''co'''''\n\nFather   '''3imp=aux.fut-ind2'''   3r=dance-ger      '''past'''\n\n\u2018Dad was going to dance.\u2019\n\nBoth of these case indicate events that could have happened in the near future but didn't in the past tense. In Karo, it is possible to find both past markers in the same clause with ''co'' usually appearing before ''k\u00e1n.'' For instance,\n\n''Example of co used with k\u00e1n''<ref>Gabas, 139</ref>\n\n''\u014dn opit m\u0259y m\u00e3m   '''co'''      '''k\u00e1n'''''\n\n''\u014dn o=pi-t m\u0259y m\u00e3m   '''co'''      '''k\u00e1n'''''\n\n1sg 1sg=perforate-ind1 long x         '''past rpast'''\n\n'''\u2018'''I took the vaccine long ago.\u2019\n\nHere, the phrase \u201cI took the vaccine\u201d takes the ''co'' marker and \u201clong ago\u201d will fall under the ''k\u00e1n'' marker.\n\n=== Future Tense ===\nThe future tense can be expressed using an auxiliary or one of two particles: ''kap, yat,'' and ''iga'' respectively''.'' The auxiliary ''kap'' is used to describe situations in the immediate or proximate future. It is usually present in the indicative mood when /-p/ and /-t/ are present.\n\nWhen constructing these different particles, clauses are a large indicator of which particle can be used. The auxiliary ''kap'' covers main actions or events and exists in separate clauses. Usually ''kap'' exhibits behaviour evidence of subjects. \u201cThe subject of the future auxiliary is always coreferential with the subject of the associated full verb\u201d (140) Thus, all marked verbs include a coreferential [[proclitic]] if the verb is intransitive and is omitted if the verb is transitive.\n\nThe first type of construction, the intransitive verb can occur in the gerund form followed by a Noun Phrase + AUXILIARY FUTURE, which receives the indicative mood marking.\n\n''Example of noun phrase + AUX FUT''<ref>Gabas, 140</ref>\n\n  _________________\n\n  |                               '''\u21a1'''\n\n'''''to'''kera             '''[ma'''\u0294w[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]'''t c\u00fa]'''     kay''\n\n'''''to='''ket-a         '''[ma'''\u0294w[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]'''t c\u00fa]'''     kap-t''\n\n'''3r='''sleep-ger   '''[man big]'''   aux.fut-ind1\n\n\u2018The big man is going to sleep.\u2019\n\nHere, ''to'' is attached to the verb with ''kay'' being attached in the end which indicates the future conjugation. While in the case below when the case is transitive, a proclitic is attached. Proclitics are a word pronounced with little emphasis, so much so that usually they are shortened and added to the next word. Common examples in English are ''y\u2019all (you all)'' and ''t\u2019was (it was).'' In these cases, the person of the subject of the future auxiliary, is omitted.\n\n''Example with omitted ergative''<ref>Gabas, 141</ref>\n\n  ________________________\n\n  |                                              \u21a1\n\n'''(\u00f8)'''   m''\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u026a\u0303a        '''[wat ow\u1ebd]'''     kay''\n\n'''(\u00f8)'''   m''\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u026a\u0303-a       '''[wat ow\u1ebd]'''     kap-t''\n\n'''(\u00f8)'''   snake ''      kill-ger   '''[1sg.poss child]'''''   aux.fut-ind1\n\n\u2018My son is going to kill a/the snake.\u2019\n\nFurthermore, ''yat'' is the second future marker in Karo which primarily focuses on the simple future. ''Yat'' typically occurs at the end of a clause since its constructed with the main verb or auxiliary. Here is an example of this in Karo.\n\n''Example of yat with simple future''<ref>Gabas, 142</ref>\n\n''ameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wan yat''\n\n''ameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wat-t     ''' yat'''''\n\njaguar big leave.ind1   '''fut'''\n\n\u2018The big jaguar will leave.\u2019\n\nAnother interesting feature about ''yat'' is that it also refers to nouns in noun phrases which is often written as [future N]. A good example is this one mentioned below;\n\n''Example of yat in noun phrase''<ref name=\":15\">Gabas, 143</ref>\n\nwat ka\u0294a     \u0294a yat\n\nwat ka\u0294a     \u0294a\u0294    '''yat'''\n\n1sg.poss house cl.rd   '''fut'''\n\n\u2018My future house\u2019\n\nIn addition to noun phrases, ''yat'' also present in with the negative particle. Here, the future particle is present before the negative:\n\n''Example of yat in with the negative particle''<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wan nyat i\u0294ke\n\nameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wat-t      '''yat'''     i\u0294ke\n\njaguar big leave.ind1   '''fut'''     neg\n\n\u2018The big jaguar will not leave.\u2019\n\nLastly, ''iga'' is the future particle which is used to mark simple future exclusively in negative-interrogative clauses. Unlike ''yat, iga'' examples uses the [[Negative (grammar)|negative]] \u201c''taykit\u201d.'' For instance:\n\n''Example of iga in negative-interrogative''<ref>Gabas, 144</ref>\n\n''taykir at a?toy iga''\n\n'''''taykir'''   at a?=top-t           '''iga'''''\n\n'''neg'''      3sg 3sg=see-ind1   '''fut'''\n\n\u2018Isn't he going to see it/him?\u2019\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* ELAR archive of [http://elar.soas.ac.uk/deposit/0206 Karo language documentation materials]\n\n{{Tupian languages}}\n\n[[Category:Tupian languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox language\n|name= Karo\n|nativename=Ramarama\n|states= [[Brazil]]\n|speakers= 210\n|date=2006\n|ref=e18\n|familycolor=American\n|fam1=[[Tupian languages|Tupian]]\n|fam2=[[Ramarama languages|Ramarama]]\n|dia1=Arara\n|dia2=Uruku\n|iso3=arr\n|glotto=karo1305\n|glottorefname=Karo (Brazil)\n}}\n\n'''Ramarama''', also known as '''Karo''', is a [[Tupian language]] of Brazil.\n\nUnusually for the indigenous languages of South America in general and Tupian in particular, Ramarama is a fairly [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, with limited affixation and a strict [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] word order. However, the language also displays complex processes of [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] alternation, segmental [[Allophone|allophony]], and interaction between segmental and [[Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental]] phonology.\n\n== Setting ==\nThe Arara people speak this language, also formally known as [[Arara (Par\u00e1)|Arara]] but had to be changed in the late 1980s so the language could be distinguished from other languages in the Arara branch by similar Brazilian groups. At one point, Ntogapid, Ramarama, Uruku, Urumi and Ytanga were all thought to be sister languages of Karo.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Karo|title=Karo - Indigenous Peoples of Brazil|last=Gabas|first=Nilson|date=|website=Povos Ind\u00edgenas No Brasil|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After further study, it was determined that they were all the same language that was classified as different languages during various ethnology work in Brazil. The Karo language is spoken in two villages in Brazil; Iterap and Paygap. These villages are located in the Southern region of the Lourdes Stream Indigenous Land in [[Rond\u00f4nia]], which is in the central west part of Brazil.\n\n[[Denny Moore]]'s 2006 summary of indigenous language vitality in Brazil documents that there the Arara people have a population of 184, with most of the population speaking the language and a good transmission rate of the language between generations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Denny|date=|title=Brazil: Language Situation|url=|journal=The Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics|volume=|pages=117\u2013128|via=}}</ref> Although [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is taught as a second language for contact purposes, the native language is still used for many occasions in daily life.

As a result, their culture has suffered tremendously to the point where it almost disappeared.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some cultural traditions included a corn harvest festival and secluding children until the time they got married. Although their culture has suffered, many traditions such as rites of passages for marriage and naming children have stayed similar. Other traditions have stayed consistent such as their material culture. The Karo people have a deep history of creating many forms of art such as bracelets, baskets, or clay pots. Furthermore, the Karo speakers were known to interact with surrounding peoples in the areas but it was not until the 1940s when they were contacted by the [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio|Indian Protection Services]] (SPI).<ref name=\":0\" /> Settlers brought over new diseases such as pneumonia, measles and the flu which lead to many indigenous people dying in this time period. Luckily, in the 1960s the Arara people regrouped with a nearby people known as the [[Gavi\u00e3o (G\u00ea)|Gavi\u00e3o]] where they eventually grew in size.<ref name=\":0\" /> By the mid-1980s, the group was able to find their own village and get federal recognition from local groups.\n\nWhile the Arara people were severely affected by the colonizers who brought many diseases to their people, there is no documentation on conflicts amongst the colonizers. However, there is documentation of conflicts between two groups of Arara. This conflict was between the main group and another group called the \u201cBlack Feet\u201d who spoke a different dialect of the language.<ref name=\":0\" /> The groups often got along but there are documentations of conflicts between the two which turned so violent that some lead in death. Moreover, there are no written material on schools for the Karo people. Most people in the village do speak Arara and Portuguese so it is very likely that most of these community members went to schools outside their village.\n\n=== Documentation ===\nThe earliest documentation of the Karo language was published by [[Germany|German]] ethnographer [[Curt Nimuendaj\u00fa|Curt Nimuendaju]] who produced three wordlists from 1925 to 1955, though he referred to the language as Ntogap\u00edd.<ref name=\":3\">Gabas Jr., ''Genetic relationship within the Ramar\u00e1ma family of the Tup\u00ed stock (Brazil)''</ref><ref>Nimuendaj\u00fa, Curt, \u201cAs Tribus do Alto Madeira.\u201d ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Am\u00e9ricanistes''XVII (1925): 137-172.</ref><ref>Nimuendaj\u00fa, Curt, \u201cWortlisten aus Amazonien.\u201d ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Am\u00e9ricanistes''XXIV (1932): 93-119.</ref><ref>Nimuendaj\u00fa, Curt, \u201cReconhecimento dos rios I\u00e7\u00e1na, Ayar\u00ed, e Uaup\u00e9s, mar\u00e7o a julho de 1927: Apontamentos lingu\u00edsticos,\u201d ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Am\u00e9ricanistes''44 (1955): 149-178.</ref> Several additional wordlists of Karo, listed under different names, were published during the twentieth century as the Karo people came into greater contact with outside groups.<ref name=\":3\" /> These lists were collected by a variety of people for different aims\u2014a few by anthropologists and ethnographers, one commissioned by a Catholic priest and some by members of the Comiss\u00e3o de Linhas Telegr\u00e1ficas Estrat\u00e9gicas de Mato-Grosso ao Amazonas (Commission of Strategic Telegraphic Wires from Mato-Grosso to Amazonas) who aimed to expand the Western borders of Brazil in the mid-nineteenth century.<ref name=\":3\" /> In the twentieth century, two further wordlists have been published, one by Ruth Fonini Monserrat in the year 2000<ref>Monserrat, Ruth Fonini, ''Vocabul\u00e1rio Amondawa-Portugu\u00eas, [etc.],'' Caixas do Sul: Universidade do Caixas do Sul, 2000.</ref> and the other through a 2004 language documentation project by Nilsen Gabas Jr.<ref name=\":4\">\u201cDocumentation and Description of Karo, Brazil,\u201d ''Endangered Language Archive at SOAS University of London'', <nowiki>http://elar.soas.ac.uk/desposit/0206</nowiki></ref>\n\nThe majority of detailed linguistic descriptions completed on the Karo language was done by Gabas Jr. who wrote his master's thesis on the [[phonology]] of Karo before going on to specialize in the language.<ref>Gabas, Jr., Nilson.

The only substantial material published containing a small description of the life of the Arara can be found in anthropological works by French anthropologist, [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|L\u00e9vi-Strauss]].\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe Karo language belongs to the Tup\u00ed stock of Brazilian Indigenous languages which includes up to 10 language families\u2014Karo in particular is a member of the [[Ramarama languages|Ramar\u00e1ma]] family.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1964 [[Aryon Rodrigues|Aryon Dall\u2019Igna Rodrigues]] published a classification of the Tup\u00ed stock that placed four languages within the Ramar\u00e1ma family: Ramar\u00e1ma, Uruk\u00fa, Urum\u00ed and Karo.<ref>Rodrigues, Aryon Dall'Igna, Arnaldo Hauptmann, and Thekla Hartmann, \"A CLASSIFICA\u00c7\u00c3O DO TRONCO LING\u00dc\u00cdSTICO TUP\u00cd,\" ''Revista De Antropologia''12, no. 1/2 (1964): 103, {{jstor|41615767}}</ref> However, in 2000, Gabas Jr released a detailed comparative analysis of the wordlists published in those languages that challenged these assumptions and concluded that the only language in the Ramar\u00e1ma language family is Karo.<ref>Gabas Jr., Nilson, \"Genetic relationship within the Ramar\u00e1ma family of the Tup\u00ed stock (Brazil),\" ''Indigenous languages of lowland South America''(2000): 80-82,<nowiki>http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/illa:vol1n6/illa_vol1n6_gabas.pdf</nowiki></ref> It has been proposed that Karo and another Tup\u00ed language [[Purubora language|Purubor\u00e1]] are both part of a singular Ramar\u00e1ma-Purubor\u00e1 language family, however this is controversial. A joint 2015 computational study comparing common word lists in all Tup\u00ed languages found minimal support for that theory.<ref>Ana Vilacy Galucio & al., \u201cGenealogical relations and lexical distances within the Tupian linguistic family,\u201d ''Boletim do Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi.

The permissible structures of a monosyllable are therefore V, CV, VC, and CVC. However, only the glottal stop /\u0294/ can occur as a non-word-final coda consonant. Hence the permissible structures of a polysyllabic word is as follows: ...(C)V(\u0294)(C)V(C). Words of more than three syllables are rare.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nRamarama has a fairly small consonant inventory, with a wide range of allophonic variation. Notably, the language lacks any fricatives other than /h/, which itself occurs only infrequently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Karo, Tupi (Brazil)|last=Gabas|first=Nilson Jr.|publisher=University of California|year=1999|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Stop consonant|'''Stop''']]\n|[[Voicelessness|Voiceless]]\n|p\n|t\n|c\n|k\n|\u0294\n|-\n|[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]]\n|b\n|r\n|\n|g\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|'''Nasal''']]\n|m\n|n\n|\n|\u014b\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|'''Fricative''']]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|h\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|'''Approximant''']]\n|w\n|\n|j <y>\n|\n|\n|}\nThe tap /r/, though not phonetically a stop, is represented as such because it patterns as the voiced equivalent of the stop /t/. This may indicate a historical [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].\n\n==== Allophony ====\nThe voiced stops /b g/ may be [[Lenition|lenited]] to [\u03b2 \u0263] in the onset of an unstressed syllable and after a vowel: ''yaba'' [\u02c8yaba ~ \u02c8ya\u03b2a] \"species of rodent\". The palatal stop /c/ may be lenited to [\u00e7] in all circumstances ([[free variation]]).\n\nThe voiceless stops /p t c k/ are [[Gemination|geminated]] in the onsets of non-initial stressed syllables: ''it\u0268'' [i\u02c8t\u02d0\u0268] \"deer\". They are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]] in the coda of a word-final syllable: ''makap'' [ma\u02c8k\u02d0ap\u031a] \"peanut\".\n\nNasal stops /m n \u014b/ surface as post-stopped nasals [m\u1d47 n\u1d48 \u014b\u1da2] in the onsets of stressed oral syllables: ''na\u0294mi'' [na\u0294\u02c8m\u1d47i]  \"species of wasp\". Conversely, they surface as ''pre''-stopped nasals [\u1d47m \u1d48n \u1da2\u014b] in the codas of stressed oral syllables: ''ken'' [k\u025b\u1d48n] \"to sleep\".\n\nThe [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] /w j/ are nasalized [w\u0303 \u0237\u0303] before nasal vowels. The [[Flap consonant|tap]] /r/ is nasalized [r\u0303] only between two nasal vowels, when the first vowel is stressed (as in the process of nasal spreading discussed below).\n\n=== Vowels ===\nRamarama has a large vowel inventory, with seven oral and four nasal vowels:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Central vowel|Central]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n|'''[[Close vowel|High]]'''\n|i \u0129\n|\u0268\n|u\n|-\n|'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''\n|e \u1ebd\n|\u0259\n|o \u00f5\n|-\n|'''[[Open vowel|Low]]'''\n|\n|a \u00e3\n|\n|}\nThe mid oral vowels /e o/ alternate with low-mid [\u025b \u0254]: syllables with high pitch surface with [e o], while unstressed syllables or those with mid pitch surface with [\u025b \u0254]. Such interaction between tone and vowel quality is cross-linguistically rare.<ref>Gabas, Nilson Jr. (1999), p. 17.</ref>\n\nNasal vowels have a restricted distribution. Nilson Gabas Jr. (1999) writes that \"there seems to be just one underlying nasal vowel per word\",<ref>Gabas, Nilson Jr. (1999), p. 33.</ref> yet transcribes several examples with more than one nasal vowel that nasal spreading cannot account for (e.g. ''m\u00e3yg\u00e3ra'' \"snake\"); this may indicate a nasal spreading rule as yet undescribed, or a freer distribution of nasal vowels than indicated. In any case, nasal vowels also never occur in a penultimate syllable when followed by a voiceless stop in the onset of the final syllable; in other words, sequences of the format /\u1e7cC<sup>-VOICE</sup>V#/ are disallowed, presumably because such sequences would create a conflict in stress assignment.\n\n==== Nasal spreading ====\nLike many languages with phonemic nasal vowels, Ramarama displays nasal spreading (nasalization of otherwise non-nasal segments due to proximity to a nasal segment) in some circumstances.\n\nObligatory rightward nasal spreading occurs when a stressed penultimate nasal vowel is followed by the consonants /r g/ as the onset of a following oral syllable. The following syllable is thus nasalized, and with it the onset consonants (which become [r\u0303 \u014b]): ''c\u1ebdrat'' /\u02c8c\u1ebdrat/ \"smooth\" surfaces as [\u02c8c\u1ebdr\u0303\u0259\u0303t\u031a].\n\nAn optional ''in''ward nasal spreading occurs when an oral vowel occurs between two nasal consonants. The vowel may then be nasalized: ''anana'' /anana/ \"pineapple\" may become [an\u0259\u0303\u02c8n\u1d48a].\n\n=== Stress ===\nStress is not phonemic in Ramarama, and its placement is mostly fixed to the final syllable. However, the following rules can move stress to the penultimate syllable:\n\n# If the final syllable's onset is one of the voiced consonants /b r g/, stress is shifted to the penult: ''yogo'' \"eel\" surfaces as [\u02c8j\u0254g\u0254], not *[j\u0254\u02c8g\u0254].\n# Syllables with nasal nuclei, whether beginning with a voiced stop or not, are automatically stressed: ''\u0129ya'' \"bird\" surfaces as [\u02c8\u0129ja], while ''cig\u00e3'' \"bone\" surfaces as [ci\u02c8g\u00e3].\n# Syllables with high pitch, whether beginning with a voiced stop or not, are likewise automatically stressed: ''w\u00edup'' \"native, non-domesticated\" surfaces as [\u02c8w\u00ed.up\u031a], while ''yog\u00e1'' \"egg\" surfaces as [j\u0254\u02c8g\u00e1]\n\n=== Tone ===\nRamarama has a simple system of register [[Pitch accent (intonation)|pitch accent]], in which one syllable per word (the penultimate or final) can be marked by a high pitch. A syllable thus marked is always stressed. Stressed vowels ''without'' marked pitch surface phonetically as middle pitch, while unstressed vowels (except those affected by tone spreading) surface as low pitch: ''parato'' \"armadillo\" may be represented phonetically as [p\u00e0r\u00e0\u02c8t\u02d0\u014d], while ''nak\u00e1'' \"head\" may be represented as [n\u00e0\u02c8k\u02d0\u00e1].\n\nTone spreading occurs when a syllable marked with high or mid pitch occurs in the penultimate syllable and is followed by a voiced segment /b r g w j m n \u014b/ or /\u00d8/; hence ''k\u00e1wan'' \"be fat\" surfaces as [k\u00e1w\u00e1n], while ''yaba'' \"species of rodent\" surfaces as [\u02c8j\u0101b\u0101]. This process, roughly analogous to the obligatory nasal spreading rule, appears to be the only means by which unstressed syllables can be raised to high or mid pitch.\n\n=== Sandhi ===\nIn continuous speech Ramarama's small consonant inventory is further reduced, and simultaneously complicated, by complex morphophonological processes of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] ([[sandhi]]). These processes affect the voiceless stops /p t k/ as follows:\n\n# /p t k/ voice to /b r g/ at word boundaries, before (if in the coda of the preceding word) or after (if in the onset of the following word) a vowel or a glide. Thus ''cawap w\u0268y'' \"the sun rose\" surfaces as ''cawa'''b''' w\u0268y'', while ''\u00f3ra pec\u00e9p'' \"[an] ugly song\" surfaces as ''\u00f3ra '''b'''ec\u00e9p.''\n# /p k/ voice to /b g/ in word-final codas if followed by an unstressed word-initial nasal consonant: ''wakak nak\u00e1'' \"[a] bird's head\" surfaces as ''waga'''g''' nak\u00e1''. If followed by a ''stressed'' vowel, /k/ still voices but /p/ changes to [h]: ''na\u0294yop n\u00f5'' \"one of the leaves\" surfaces as ''na\u0294yo'''h''' n\u00f5''.\n# /p t k/ nasalize to /m n \u014b/ word-initially when preceded by a nasal consonant, and word-finally when followed by a nasal consonant '''and''' preceded by a nasal vowel. Thus ''o=ku\u014b k\u0268t'' \"my white belly\" surfaces as ''oku\u014b '''\u014b'''\u0268t'', while ''n\u00e3p nak\u00e1'' \"[a] bee's head\" surfaces as ''n\u00e3'''m''' nak\u00e1.''\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe morphology of Karo consists of different morphological properties including [[word class]]es, [[affix]]es, [[clitic]]s, [[nominalization]]s, and [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]. It is a mildly [[Synthetic language|synthetic]]-[[fusional language]].<ref>Gabas, Nilson, Jr. \"A Grammar of Karo, Tup\u00ed (Brazil): A Dissertation Submitted in Partial Satisfaction of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Linguistics.\" September 23, 1999: 38-94.</ref> Word classes contain morphemes such as [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, etc. \u2014 Karo contains a total of nine word classes. Karo has a class of pronouns which include four different types: [[Personal pronoun|personal]], [[Possessive pronoun|possessive]], [[Interrogative Pronoun|interrogative]], and [[demonstrative]]. [[Noun]]s are their own class in Karo though they are not inflected for [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[Grammatical case|case]]. They can be combined with clitics and modified by adjectives. The verb class in the language are typically sentence-final and are distinctly categorized into [[Transitive verb|transitive]] and [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] categories. [[Auxiliary verb|Auxiliary]] class words are similar to intransitive verbs in English, but with little lexical meaning. In Karo, adjectives are considered an [[Open class (linguistics)|open class]], meaning they accepts the addition of any new words, and usually appear following the head noun in a [[noun phrase]]. [[Adverb]]s, unlike adjectives, typically appear at the end or beginning of a [[clause]] and are a closed class though manner adverbials, which derive from adjectives and include numerals, are open class. [[Preposition and postposition|Postpositions]] form their own phrases and contribute to the sentence as [[Argument (linguistics)|oblique arguments]]. [[Grammatical particle|Particles]] in Karo, like with many other languages, are defined negatively because they are defined by not being part of any other word class. In Karo, particles are similar to adverbs but less cohesively defined. Finally, the most complex class in Karo is [[ideophone]]s. Semantically similar to verbs, and morphologically similar to the particles, ideophones are an open class that are not inflectionally marked.\n\nAffixes form morphological processes. There are three inflectional suffixes exist in Karo:''-t'' the first [[Realis mood|indicative]],''-p'' the second indicative, and ''-a''the [[gerund]] suffix. In addition, the language contains only six derivational prefixes, five which have specific functions: ''ma-'' the [[Causative|simple causative]], ''ta-'' the [[Comitative case|comitative causative]], ''pe-'' the [[Impersonal passive voice|impersonal passive]], ''to-'' the [[Reciprocal pronoun|reciprocal]],''m\u00e3'' ''m-'' the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]. The remaining one ''pe'' \u0294''-'' is an [[Optative mood|optative]]. Karo is also known for its use of clitics, which are affixes by their distribution. Clitics in this language are typically found within larger constituents than words and Karo in fact contains four: plural marker ''=to'' \u0294'','' adverbializer =''tem'', a set of personal markers and nominalizer ''ko=.'' Lastly, compounding in Karo is quite popular and most [[morpheme]] compounds consist of noun + adjective, noun + intransitive verb and noun + noun pairs. All of these elements together compile the basic elements of Karo morphology.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nBelow are tables listing of the [[Personal pronoun|personal]] and [[possessive]] pronouns as well as the personal clitics. Personal pronouns are used in [[Ergative case|ergative]] or [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] arguments of transitive verbs. The [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], or [[Accusative case|object]], pronouns has as separate system of personal clitics which are marked for the argument of intransitive sentences and the patient arguments of transitive sentences. The possessive pronouns are used with alienable nouns. Additionally, there are also the [[Interrogative Pronoun|interrogative]] pronouns ''n''\u00e3''n'' \u2018who, what\u2019, ''k\u0268gom\u0259t'' \u2018which\u2019, and the [[demonstrative]] pronouns ''y\u00e9t'' \u2018that (close to speaker)\u2019, ''t\u0259t'' \u2018that (close to hearer)\u2019 and ''yeket'' \u2018that (far from both)'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 3 - Personal Pronouns<ref name=\":5\">Gabas, 39.</ref>\n!\n!First Person\n!Second Person\n!Third Person\n![[Feminine gender|Third Person Feminine]]\n|-\n|[[Singular number|Singular]]\n|\u00f5n\n|\u1ebdn\n|at\n|\u014ba\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Inclusive)]]\n|i\u0294t\u0259\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ka\u0294to\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |tap\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Exclusive)]]\n|t\u00e9\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 4 - Referential Clitics<ref>Gabas, 81</ref>\n!\n!First Person\n!Second Person\n!Third Person\n![[Feminine gender|Third Person Feminine]]\n|-\n|[[Singular number|Singular]]\n|o=\n|e=\n|a\u0294=\n|\u014ba=\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Inclusive)]]\n|i\u0294=\n| rowspan=\"2\" |karo=\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |tap=\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Exclusive)]]\n|t\u00e9=\n|-\n|IND1EF\n| colspan=\"4\" |i=\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 5 - Possessive Pronouns<ref name=\":5\" />\n!\n!First Person\n!Second Person\n!Third Person\n![[Feminine gender|Third Person Feminine]]\n|-\n|[[Singular number|Singular]]\n|wat\n|et\n|at\n|\u014baat\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Inclusive)]]\n|i\u0294yat\n| rowspan=\"2\" |karowat\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |tabat\n|-\n|[[Clusivity|Plural (Exclusive)]]\n|te\u0294et\n|-\n|IND1EF\n| colspan=\"4\" |yat=\n|}\n''Examples of pronoun use''<ref>Gabas, 40</ref><ref>Gabas, 43</ref><ref name=\":7\">Gabas, 46</ref><ref name=\":7\" /><ref>Gabas, 44</ref><ref>Gabas, 56</ref><ref>Gabas, 82</ref><ref>Gabas, 83</ref>\n\n'''''n\u00e3n   \u1ebdn'''      i=top''\n\n'''who 2sg'''   3imp=see\n\n'Who/what did you see?\u2019\n\n'''''wat'''             ka\u0294a''\n\n'''1sg.poss'''   house\n\n\u2018My house\u2019\n\n'''''\u014ba'''=w\u00e9-t''\n\n'''3sg.fem'''=cry-ind1\n\n\u2018She cried.\u2019\n\n'''''tap'''=peri-t''\n\n'''3pl'''=cry-ind1\n\n\u2018They cried.\u2019\n\n'''''i\u0294t\u0259'''         tap''\n\n'''1pl.incl'''   assoc\n\n\u2018ours (things), us\u2019\n\n''caropap=tem   '''ka\u0294to'''   karo=k\u00f5na''\n\nsad=advz        '''2pl'''        2pl=emph\n\n\u2018You (pl.) are sad.\u2019\n\nameko   '''o='''top-t\n\njaguar    '''1sg='''see-ind1\n\n'The jaguar saw me.'\n\n'''a''\u0294='''''<nowiki/>''ken-1''\n\n'''3sg='''sleep-ind1\n\n'He slept.'\n\n=== Indicatives ===\nThe two [[Realis mood|indicative]] Karo suffixes, ''-t'', ''-p'' have a fine distinction between them. The term \u2018indicative\u2019 in the case of Karo is used for lack of a better label and is split into (ind1) ''-t'' and (ind2) ''-p.'' They have many similarities. Like all the inflectional suffixes, they can only join at the end of verb, auxiliary and [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] predicates. In addition, both are used to represent the main statement within a clause. The only difference is the type of statement clauses that they occur in. The first indicative ''-t'' is used that are in [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] position. It can appear [[allomorph]]ically after nasal vowels are ''/-n/''. Conversely, the second indicative ''-p'' only appears when one phrase has been moved into focus position. This suffix can appear as ''/-ap/'' after consonants or ''/-m/'' after nasal vowels.\n\n''Examples of first and second indicative suffixes''<ref name=\":8\">Gabas, 57</ref><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Gabas, 60</ref><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n''\u00f5n m\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u0129-'''n'''        t\u0259gana pe\u0294''\n\n1sg snake kill'''-ind1'''   there loc\n\n\u2018I killed the snake there.\u2019\n\n''at to=wirup   \u0294o'''-t'''           c\u00fa-tem''\n\n3sg 3r=food eat'''-ind1'''   big=advz\n\n\u2018He ate his own food a lot.\u2019\n\n''t\u0259gana pe\u0294   \u00f5n m\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u0129-'''m'''''\n\nthere loc 1sg snake kill-'''ind2'''\n\n\u2018It was there that I killed the snake.\u2019\n\n''c\u00fa=tem at to=wirup   \u0294o-'''p'''''\n\nbig=advs 3sg 3r=food eat-'''ind2'''\n\n\u2018A lot, he ate his own food.\u2019\n\n=== Nominalization ===\nEntire verbs, verb phrases, and clauses in Karo can be transformed into nouns through three manners: the suffix -''ap,'' the particle ''kan\u00e3'' and the clitic ''ko=.'' The suffix -''ap'' takes transitive and intransitive verbs and yield [[Agent (grammar)|agentive]] nominals. It is the only form of nominalization in Karo that does not also utilize the non finite indicating gerund suffix -''a.'' These types of verbs can also be turned into place nouns with the particle ''kan\u00e3.'' This particle can also be used with the absolutive argument form of \u2018to like\u2019 to form actions. The nominalizing clitic ''ko='' works in conjunction with the absolutive argument of  \u2018to perceive\u2019 to transform whole clauses into nouns.\n\n''Examples of nominalization''<ref>Gabas, 86</ref><ref name=\":10\">Gabas, 87</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>Gabas, 89</ref>\n\n''\u0294o-'''p'''''\n\neat-'''nomz'''\n\n\u2018eater\u2019\n\n''o=ker-a             '''  kan\u00e3'''''\n\n1sg=sleep-ger    '''nomz'''\n\n\u2018My place to sleep.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n a\u0294=w\u0129-a '''       kan\u00e3'''    ya\u0294ti\tn\u00e3-n''\n\n1sg 3sg=kill-ger   '''nomz'''   like\tcop-ind1\n\n\u2018I like to kill it.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n am\u0251an at-a        '''ko'''=top-t''\n\n1sg rain fall-ger   '''nomz'''=see-ind1\n\n\u2018I saw the rain falling.'\n\n== Syntax ==\nKaro generally follows a relatively strict [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|Subject-Object-Verb]] (SOV) sentence structure, unless one aspect of the sentence is being focused on.<ref name=\":6\">Gabas, viii.</ref> It does not mark for case on nouns, but like many Tupi languages, it follows an [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]] marking system for pronouns.<ref name=\":6\" /> Karo possesses a system made up of five distinct prefixes all with [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] affecting properties.\n\n=== Valency<ref>Gabas, 63-71</ref> ===\nKaro has five derivational prefixes that appear on a verb and change the number of arguments in the a sentence constructions. The five prefixes are as follows: ''ma''- the simple [[causative]], ''ta''- the [[Comitative case|comitative]] causative, ''pe''- the [[Impersonal passive voice|impersonal passive]], ''to-'' the [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]], and ''m\u00e3m''- the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]].\n\nWith the simple causative, an argument is added. It appears most often with intransitive verbs to indicate an initiator who causes a secondary agent who performs or experiences an action or state.\n\n''Examples of the simple causative''<ref name=\":11\">Gabas, 63</ref><ref name=\":11\" /><ref>bas, 64a</ref>\n\n''\u00f5n amaken''\n\n''\u00f5n a\u0294='''ma-'''ket-t''\n\n1sg 3sg='''caus-'''sleep-ind1\n\n\u2018I made it/him sleep.\u2019\n\n''\u014ba omacop\u0268n''\n\n''\u014ba o='''ma-'''cop\u0268t-t''\n\n3sg.fem 1sg='''caus-'''be.fat-ind1\n\n\u2018She made me fat.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n amap\u0259ri''\n\n''\u00f5n a\u0294='''ma'''-p\u0259r\u0259p=t''\n\n1sg 3sg='''caus-'''empty-ind1\n\n\u2018I emptied it.\u201d\n\nThe comitative causative also occurs mainly with the intransitive but does appear on occasion with transitive verbs. Like the simple causative it indicates an initiator who causes a secondary agent to perform or experience an action or state, but additionally indicates that the initiator is also performing or experiencing that action or state.\n\n''Examples of the comitative causative''<ref>Gabas, 65</ref><ref>Gabas, 66</ref><ref>Gabas, 67</ref>\n\n''wat ow\u00e3        orak\u0259t''\n\n''wat ow\u00e3       o='''ta-'''k\u0259-t''\n\n1sg.poss mother 1sg='''com-'''walk-INDI\n\n\u2018My mother made me walk, walking with me.\u2019\n\n''\u00f5n wat ow\u1ebd\u0301    raken''\n\n''\u00f5n wat ow\u1ebd\u0301     '''ta-'''ket-t''\n\n1sg 1sg.poss baby   '''com-'''sleep-ind1\n\n\u2018I put my baby to sleep, sleeping with it.\u2019\n\n''c\u00e3n nak\u0259ga''\n\n''c\u00e3n   '''ta-'''k\u0259k-a''\n\ncat    '''com-'''walk-ger\n\n\u2018Walk the cat!\u2019\n\nThe impersonal passive reduces the number of arguments with transitive sentence constructions. It makes the appearance of any agents in the sentence [[Grammaticality|ungrammatical]].\n\n''Examples of the impersonal passive''<ref>Gabas, 68</ref><ref name=\":12\">Gabas, 69</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\n''oy\u00e3y beme\u014b\u00e3n''\n\n''o=y\u00e3y         '''pe-'''me\u014b\u00e3-n''\n\n1sg=tooth   '''ipass-'''be.dirty.ind1\n\n\u2018My tooth got dirty.\u2019\n\n''c\u0129m mema\u0294waba''\n\n''c\u0129m     '''pe-'''ma\u0294wap-a''\n\nmeat   '''ipass'''-fry-ger\n\n\u2018The meat got fried.\u2019\n\n''abegahm\u014dm n\u00e3''\n\n''a\u0294='''pe'''-kahm\u014dm n\u00e3-a''\n\n3sg='''ipass'''-be.quiet cop-ger\n\n\u2018It got quiet/calmed down.\u2019\n\nAnother valency-reducing prefix in Karo is the reflexive which can be used in both transitive and intransitive verb constructions. With transitives, the reflexive is preceded by a [[coreferential]] personal clinic relating it to the subject clause. However, with intransitives, the reflexive and clitic are attached to the [[Dative case|dative]] marker.\n\n''Examples of the reflexive''<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\">Gabas, 70</ref><ref name=\":13\" />\n\n''\u00f5n om\u00e3mnoy''\n\n''\u00f5n o='''m\u00e3m-'''top-t''\n\n1sg 1sg='''refl-'''see-ind1\n\n\u2018I saw myself.\u2019\n\n''at tom\u00e3mw\u0129n''\n\n''at to='''m\u00e3m-'''w\u0129-n''\n\n3sg 3r='''refl-'''kill-ind1\n\n\u2018He/it killed him/itself.\u2019\n\n''owak\u00e1n om\u00e3mk\u0259y''\n\n''o=wak\u00e1-n o='''m\u00e3m'''-k\u0259y''\n\n1sg=be.angry-ind1 1sg='''refl-'''dat\n\n\u2018I am angry at myself.\u2019\n\nFinally, the reciprocal prefix is also considered to be valency-reducing and attaches itself to the root of transitive verbs. Like the reflexive, it is always preceded by a coreferential personal clitic that relates to the subject of the clause.\n\n''Examples of the reciprocal''<ref name=\":13\" /><ref>Gabas, 71</ref>\n\n''tap toroyap\u00edt''\n\n''tap to='''ro-'''yap\u00ed-t''\n\n3pl 3r-'''rec-'''kill-ind1\n\n\u2018They killed each other.\u2019\n\n''ka\u0294to karorocap\u00e9t ahy\u0259''\n\n''ka\u0294to karo='''ro-'''cap\u00e9-t ahy\u0259''\n\n2pl 2pl='''rec-'''beat-ind1 interr\n\n\u2018Did you beat each other?\u2019\n\n== Semantics<ref>Gabas, 137-144</ref> ==\nTense in Karo is marked analytically. [[Analytic language]]s are characterized by unbound morphemes or syntactical constructions. Both [[Past tense|past]] and [[Future tense|future]] tenses are marked by two particles, but future tense also utilizes one auxiliary. However, it is important to note that these markers are not necessary for the language.\n\n=== Past Tense ===\nThere are two particles in Karo. In Karo, particles are used in the past tense to refer to an action or state with the present as a point of reference. These two particles are ''co'' and ''k\u00e1n. Co'' refers to actions in the recent or simple past while ''k\u00e1n'' is used for actions that happened a long time ago or past events that relate to myths. Below are examples of ''co'' and ''k\u00e1n'' used in everyday Karo language.\n\n''Example of co''<ref>Gabas, 137</ref>\n\n''p\u00fa\u014b      wet                  '''co'''''\n\n''p\u00fa\u014b      o=\u0294e-t              '''co'''''\n\nshoot 1sg=aux-ind1   '''past'''\n\n'''\u2018'''I shot.\u2019\n\nIn this example, the verb \u201cto shoot\u201d is simple since it only contains a subject and a simple verb. It indicates that the shooting that has been done was recent. Conversely, the particle ''k\u00e1n'' is used in the far past.\n\n''Example of k\u00e1n''<ref name=\":14\">Gabas, 138</ref>\n\n'''''<nowiki/>'''''\n\n''toto obet\u00f5       '''m[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]<nowiki/>y'''            '''m\u00e3m   \u014b\u00e1n'''''\n\n''toto obet\u00f5       '''m\u026by'''            '''m\u00e3m k\u00e1n'''''\n\ngrandfather 3imp-tell  ''' long.ago x         rpast'''\n\n\u2018It was grandfather who told (the story) long ago.\u2019\n\nIn this example, this particle is only used when describing incidents in the far past. Unlike ''k\u00e1n'', ''co'' can also be used to indicate future occurrences with reference to the past. Here are a few examples of when the future tense uses ''co'' and the auxiliaries ''kap'' and ''yat.''\n\n''Example of co with future tense''<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n''war ic[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]       \u0294ara           '''okay co'''''\n\n''wat ic[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]       \u0294at-a          '''o=kap-t co'''''\n\n1sg.poss water bring-ger 1sg='''aux.fut-ind1'''   '''past'''\n\n'''\u2018'''I was going to bring my water.\u2019\n\n''iy\u00f5m      '''ikap'''                           towenaoba         '''co'''''\n\n''iy\u00f5m      '''i=kap=ap'''                   to=penaop-a      '''co'''''\n\nFather   '''3imp=aux.fut-ind2'''   3r=dance-ger      '''past'''\n\n\u2018Dad was going to dance.\u2019\n\nBoth of these case indicate events that could have happened in the near future but didn't in the past tense. In Karo, it is possible to find both past markers in the same clause with ''co'' usually appearing before ''k\u00e1n.'' For instance,\n\n''Example of co used with k\u00e1n''<ref>Gabas, 139</ref>\n\n''\u014dn opit m\u0259y m\u00e3m   '''co'''      '''k\u00e1n'''''\n\n''\u014dn o=pi-t m\u0259y m\u00e3m   '''co'''      '''k\u00e1n'''''\n\n1sg 1sg=perforate-ind1 long x         '''past rpast'''\n\n'''\u2018'''I took the vaccine long ago.\u2019\n\nHere, the phrase \u201cI took the vaccine\u201d takes the ''co'' marker and \u201clong ago\u201d will fall under the ''k\u00e1n'' marker.\n\n=== Future Tense ===\nThe future tense can be expressed using an auxiliary or one of two particles: ''kap, yat,'' and ''iga'' respectively''.'' The auxiliary ''kap'' is used to describe situations in the immediate or proximate future. It is usually present in the indicative mood when /-p/ and /-t/ are present.\n\nWhen constructing these different particles, clauses are a large indicator of which particle can be used. The auxiliary ''kap'' covers main actions or events and exists in separate clauses. Usually ''kap'' exhibits behaviour evidence of subjects. \u201cThe subject of the future auxiliary is always coreferential with the subject of the associated full verb\u201d (140) Thus, all marked verbs include a coreferential [[proclitic]] if the verb is intransitive and is omitted if the verb is transitive.\n\nThe first type of construction, the intransitive verb can occur in the gerund form followed by a Noun Phrase + AUXILIARY FUTURE, which receives the indicative mood marking.\n\n''Example of noun phrase + AUX FUT''<ref>Gabas, 140</ref>\n\n  _________________\n\n  |                               '''\u21a1'''\n\n'''''to'''kera             '''[ma'''\u0294w[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]'''t c\u00fa]'''     kay''\n\n'''''to='''ket-a         '''[ma'''\u0294w[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]]'''t c\u00fa]'''     kap-t''\n\n'''3r='''sleep-ger   '''[man big]'''   aux.fut-ind1\n\n\u2018The big man is going to sleep.\u2019\n\nHere, ''to'' is attached to the verb with ''kay'' being attached in the end which indicates the future conjugation. While in the case below when the case is transitive, a proclitic is attached. Proclitics are a word pronounced with little emphasis, so much so that usually they are shortened and added to the next word. Common examples in English are ''y\u2019all (you all)'' and ''t\u2019was (it was).'' In these cases, the person of the subject of the future auxiliary, is omitted.\n\n''Example with omitted ergative''<ref>Gabas, 141</ref>\n\n  ________________________\n\n  |                                              \u21a1\n\n'''(\u00f8)'''   m''\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u026a\u0303a        '''[wat ow\u1ebd]'''     kay''\n\n'''(\u00f8)'''   m''\u00e3yg\u00e3ra w\u026a\u0303-a       '''[wat ow\u1ebd]'''     kap-t''\n\n'''(\u00f8)'''   snake ''      kill-ger   '''[1sg.poss child]'''''   aux.fut-ind1\n\n\u2018My son is going to kill a/the snake.\u2019\n\nFurthermore, ''yat'' is the second future marker in Karo which primarily focuses on the simple future. ''Yat'' typically occurs at the end of a clause since its constructed with the main verb or auxiliary. Here is an example of this in Karo.\n\n''Example of yat with simple future''<ref>Gabas, 142</ref>\n\n''ameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wan yat''\n\n''ameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wat-t     ''' yat'''''\n\njaguar big leave.ind1   '''fut'''\n\n\u2018The big jaguar will leave.\u2019\n\nAnother interesting feature about ''yat'' is that it also refers to nouns in noun phrases which is often written as [future N]. A good example is this one mentioned below;\n\n''Example of yat in noun phrase''<ref name=\":15\">Gabas, 143</ref>\n\nwat ka\u0294a     \u0294a yat\n\nwat ka\u0294a     \u0294a\u0294    '''yat'''\n\n1sg.poss house cl.rd   '''fut'''\n\n\u2018My future house\u2019\n\nIn addition to noun phrases, ''yat'' also present in with the negative particle. Here, the future particle is present before the negative:\n\n''Example of yat in with the negative particle''<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wan nyat i\u0294ke\n\nameko c\u00fa    ya\u0294wat-t      '''yat'''     i\u0294ke\n\njaguar big leave.ind1   '''fut'''     neg\n\n\u2018The big jaguar will not leave.\u2019\n\nLastly, ''iga'' is the future particle which is used to mark simple future exclusively in negative-interrogative clauses. Unlike ''yat, iga'' examples uses the [[Negative (grammar)|negative]] \u201c''taykit\u201d.'' For instance:\n\n''Example of iga in negative-interrogative''<ref>Gabas, 144</ref>\n\n''taykir at a?toy iga''\n\n'''''taykir'''   at a?=top-t           '''iga'''''\n\n'''neg'''      3sg 3sg=see-ind1   '''fut'''\n\n\u2018Isn't he going to see it/him?\u2019\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* ELAR archive of [http://elar.soas.ac.uk/deposit/0206 Karo language documentation materials]\n\n{{Tupian languages}}\n\n[[Category:Tupian languages]]\n", "name_user": "Liggliluff", "label": "safe", "comment": "nativename in cursive", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramarama_language"}

He was a promising mathematician and chess player as a child, winning several national mathematics competitions and ranking second individually, one point short of a perfect score, at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] in 1978, where he also won a brilliancy prize.

These ideas came together in his vertex-algebraic construction and analysis of the fake monster Lie algebra (called the monster Lie algebra at the time).  \n\nBorcherds is best known for his resolution of the Conway-Norton [[monstrous moonshine|monstrous moonshine conjecture]], which describes an intricate relation between the [[monster group]] and [[modular function]]s on the complex upper half-plane.  To prove this conjecture, he drew upon theories that he had previously introduced, namely those of vertex algebras and Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, together with techniques of [[string theory]], and applied them to the \"moonshine module\", a vertex operator algebra with monster symmetry constructed by [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]].  Additional work in moonshine concerned mod p variants of this conjecture, and were known as modular moonshine.\n\nLater contributions include the theory of Borcherds products, which are holomorphic [[automorphic forms]] on ''O''(''n'',2) that have well-behaved infinite product expansions at cusps.  Borcherds used this theory to resolve some long-standing conjectures concerning quasi-affineness of certain [[moduli space]]s of [[algebraic surface]]s.

He was a promising mathematician and chess player as a child, winning several national mathematics competitions and performing exceptionally at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] in 1978 (ranking second individually, one point short of a perfect score, and with an additional brilliancy prize).

These ideas came together in his vertex-algebraic construction and analysis of the fake monster Lie algebra (called the monster Lie algebra at the time).  \n\nBorcherds is best known for his resolution of the Conway-Norton [[monstrous moonshine|monstrous moonshine conjecture]], which describes an intricate relation between the [[monster group]] and [[modular function]]s on the complex upper half-plane.  To prove this conjecture, he drew upon theories that he had previously introduced, namely those of vertex algebras and Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, together with techniques of [[string theory]], and applied them to the \"moonshine module\", a vertex operator algebra with monster symmetry constructed by [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]].  Additional work in moonshine concerned mod p variants of this conjecture, and were known as modular moonshine.\n\nLater contributions include the theory of Borcherds products, which are holomorphic [[automorphic forms]] on ''O''(''n'',2) that have well-behaved infinite product expansions at cusps.  Borcherds used this theory to resolve some long-standing conjectures concerning quasi-affineness of certain [[moduli space]]s of [[algebraic surface]]s.  More recently, Borcherds has rendered perturbative renormalization, in particular the 't Hooft-Veltman proof of perturbative renormalizability of gauge theory, into rigorous mathematical language.\n\nAn interview with [[Simon Singh]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'', in which Borcherds suggested he might have some traits associated with [[Asperger syndrome]],<ref name=singh>Simon Singh, [http://simonsingh.net/media/articles/maths-and-science/interview-with-richard-borcherds/ \"Interview with Richard Borcherds\"], ''The Guardian'' (28 August 1998)</ref> subsequently led to a chapter about him in a book on autism by [[Simon Baron-Cohen]].<ref name=sbc>{{Cite book|first=Simon|last=Baron-Cohen|authorlink=Simon Baron-Cohen|title=The Essential Difference: Male and Female Brains and the Truth about Autism|chapter=A Professor of Mathematics|publisher=Basic Books|year=2004|isbn=0-465-00556-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/essentialdiffere00baro}} (see external links) records conversations with Richard Borcherds and his family.</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4103969,00.html High flying obsessives], ''The Guardian'', December 2000</ref> Baron-Cohen concluded that while Borcherds had many autistic traits, he did not merit a formal diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.<ref name=sbc/>\n\nBorcherds has contributed to numerous mathematics articles on Wikipedia.\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nIn 1992 Borcherds was one of the first recipients of the [[European Mathematical Society|EMS prizes]] awarded at the first [[European Congress of Mathematics]] in Paris, and in 1994 he was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Zurich.<ref name=\"ams\"/> In 1994, he was elected to be a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"royal\">{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1994%2F05%27) |title=EC/1994/05: Borcherds, Richard Ewen |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=27 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PsbbMmJK?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1994%2F05%27%29 |location=London |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1998 at the 23rd [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Berlin, Germany he received the [[Fields Medal]] together with [[Maxim Kontsevich]], [[William Timothy Gowers]] and [[Curtis T.

During this expedition, Dangar identified that 'Harrington Lake' was a river with two entrances to the sea. He named the river 'Manning River' after Sir William Manning, the Deputy-Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company.\n\nIn 1829, Governor Darling proclaimed the division of the settlement of the colony of New South Wales into [[Nineteen_Counties|nineteen counties]]. The northern limit of settlement was declared to be the Manning River.\n\nTaree was laid out as a private town in 1854 by [[Henry Flett]], the son-in-law of William Wynter who had originally settled the area in 1831. {{convert|100|acre|ha}} had been set aside for the private township and 40 lots were initially sold. Taree was declared a municipality on 26 March 1885 and the first municipal council was elected by the residents.<ref>\"Taree, a short factual history 1854-1954: a century of progress\", Taree Centenary Celebrations Committee, 1954</ref> In the early 1800s the road from Newcastle to Port Macquarie came via Gloucester and forded the river near Wingham. Boats could not go further upstream than this due to narrowing of the river and rapids. Hence a town formed at Wingham, about a day's ride from Gloucester. Timber getting, especially cedar, ensured goods were brought to Wingham and then shipped to Newcastle and beyond by boat. Coopernook similarly formed a local shipping hub. In 1844, the government of New South Wales had established [[Wingham, New South Wales|Wingham]] as its administrative centre. When the [[North Coast railway line, New South Wales|North Coast railway line]] came through in 1913,<ref name=\"The Age\"/> it ended initially at Taree.

During this expedition, Dangar identified that 'Harrington Lake' was a river with two entrances to the sea. He named the river 'Manning River' after Sir William Manning, the Deputy-Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company.\n\nIn 1829, Governor Darling proclaimed the division of the settlement of the colony of New South Wales into [[Nineteen_Counties|nineteen counties]]. The northern limit of settlement was declared to be the Manning River.\n\nTaree was laid out as a private town in 1854 by [[Henry Flett]], the son-in-law of William Wynter who had originally settled the area in 1831. {{convert|100|acre|ha}} had been set aside for the private township and 40 lots were initially sold. Taree was declared a municipality on 26 March 1885 and the first municipal council was elected by the residents.<ref>\"Taree, a short factual history 1854-1954: a century of progress\", Taree Centenary Celebrations Committee, 1954</ref> In the early 1800s the road from Newcastle to Port Macquarie came via Gloucester and forded the river near Wingham. Boats could not go further upstream than this due to narrowing of the river and rapids. Hence a town formed at Wingham, about a day's ride from Gloucester. Timber getting, especially cedar, ensured goods were brought to Wingham and then shipped to Newcastle and beyond by boat. Coopernook similarly formed a local shipping hub. In 1844, the government of New South Wales had established [[Wingham, New South Wales|Wingham]] as its administrative centre. When the [[North Coast railway line, New South Wales|North Coast railway line]] came through in 1913,<ref name=\"The Age\"/> it ended initially at Taree.
