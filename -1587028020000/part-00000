{"title_page": "Anti-Italianism", "text_new": "{{Discrimination sidebar}}\n'''Anti-Italianism''' or '''Italophobia''' is a negative attitude regarding [[Italian people]] or people with Italian ancestry, often expressed through the use of prejudice, [[discrimination]], or [[stereotypes]]. Its opposite is [[Italophilia]].\n\n==Anti-Italianism in the United States==\nAnti-Italianism arose among some Americans as an effect of the large-scale immigration of Italians to the United States during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.  The majority of Italian immigrants to the United States arrived in waves in the early-twentieth century, many of them from agrarian backgrounds. The majority of the Italian immigrants were [[Catholic]] [[Southern Italy|Southern Italians]] with dark features and dark or swarthy [[olive skin]], as opposed to the nation's [[Northwestern Europe]]an or [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] Protestant majority. Because Southern Italian immigrants often lacked formal education, and competed with earlier immigrants for lower-paying jobs and housing, much hostility existed toward them.<ref>Mangione, Jerre and Ben Morreale, ''La Storia \u2013 Five Centuries of the Italian American Experience'', Harper Perennial,1992</ref> The established Protestant Americans of Northwestern European ancestry aggressively displayed and acted on  [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric chauvinism]] and [[racism]] against Southern Italians based on the Italians\u2019 dark features and skin and Catholic religion, especially in the [[Southern United States|American South]], the population there being overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.  In reaction to the large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe, Congress passed legislation ([[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and [[Immigration Act of 1924]]) restricting immigration from those regions, but not from Anglo-Saxon countries.\n\nAnti-Italian prejudice was sometimes associated with the [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic]] tradition that existed in the United States, which was inherited as a result of Protestant/Catholic European competition and wars, which had been fought between Protestants and Catholics over the preceding three centuries. When the United States was founded, it inherited the anti-Catholic, anti-papal animosity of its original [[Protestantism|Protestant]] settlers. Anti-Catholic sentiments in the U.S. reached a peak in the 19th century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the large number of Catholics who were immigrating to the United States. This was due in part to the standard tensions that arise between native-born citizens and immigrants. The resulting [[Nativism (politics)#Anti-Catholic nativism in the 19th century|anti-Catholic nativist movement]], which achieved prominence in the 1840s, led to hostility that resulted in mob violence, including the burning of Catholic property.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907171941/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |archivedate=2008-09-07 }}</ref>  The Italian immigrants inherited this anti-Catholic hostility upon arrival; however, unlike some of the other Catholic immigrant groups, they generally did not bring with them priests and other religious who could help ease their transition into American life. To remedy this situation, Pope [[Leo XIII]] dispatched a contingent of priests, nuns and brothers of the [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] and other orders (among which was Sister [[Francesca Cabrini]]), who helped establish hundreds of parishes to serve the needs of the Italian communities, such as [[Our Lady of Pompeii Church (Manhattan)|Our Lady of Pompeii]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourladyofpompeiinyc.com/History|title=History - Our Lady of Pompeii NYC|website=Our Lady of Pompeii Church|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417093556/http://www.ourladyofpompeiinyc.com/History|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of the early 20th-century immigrants from Italy brought with them a political disposition toward [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]]. This was a reaction to the economic and political conditions which they had experienced in Italy. Such men as [[Arturo Giovannitti]], [[Carlo Tresca]], and [[Joe Ettor]] were in the forefront of organising Italians and other immigrant labourers in demanding better working conditions and shorter working hours in the mining, textile, garment, construction and other industries. These efforts often resulted in strikes, which sometimes erupted into violence between the strikers and strike-breakers. The anarchy movement in the United States at that time was responsible for bombings in major cities, and attacks on officials and law enforcement.<ref>Bruce Watson, ''Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream,'' New York, NY: Viking [2005]</ref> As a result of the association of some with the labour and anarchy movements, Italian Americans were branded as [[labor movement|labor agitators]] and radicals by many of the business owners and the wealthier class of the time, which resulted in anti-Italian sentiments.\n\nThe vast majority of Italian immigrants worked hard and lived honest lives, as documented by police statistics of the early-twentieth century in [[Boston]] and [[New York City]]. Italian immigrants had an arrest rate which was no greater than those of other major immigrant groups.<ref>[http://www.clevelandmemory.org/italians/partii.html, pg. 123], Cleveland Memory</ref> As late as 1963, James W. Vander Zander noted that the rate of criminal convictions among Italian immigrants was less than that among [[White Americans|American-born whites]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=W.

When the [[Fascism in Italy|Fascists]] came to power in Italy, they made the destruction of [[the Mafia]] in [[Sicily]] a high priority ([[Sicilian Mafia during the Mussolini regime]]). Hundreds fled to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s in order to avoid prosecution.\n\nWhen the United States enacted [[Prohibition]] in 1920, the restrictions proved to be an economic windfall for those in the Italian-American community who were already involved in illegal activities, as well as those who had fled from Sicily. They smuggled liquor into the country, wholesaled and sold it through a network of outlets and speakeasies. While members of other ethnic groups were also deeply involved in these illegal bootlegging activities, and the associated violence between groups, Italian Americans were among the most notorious.<ref>Fox, Stephen,  ''Blood and Power'', William Morrow and Co., 1989</ref>  Because of this, Italians became associated with the prototypical [[gangster]] in the minds of many, which had a long-lasting effect on the Italian-American image.\n\nThe experiences of Italian immigrants in [[North America]]n countries were notably different than those in [[South America]]n countries, where many of them immigrated in large numbers. Italians were key in developing countries such as: [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]].

Many soon found themselves the victims of prejudice, economic exploitation, and they were sometimes victims of violence. Anti-Italian stereotypes abounded during this period as a means of justifying the maltreatment of the immigrants. The plight of the Italian immigrant agricultural workers in Mississippi was so serious that the Italian embassy became involved in investigating their mistreatment in cases that were studied for [[peonage]].

During the early 20th century, the KKK became active in northern and midwestern cities, where social change had been rapid due to immigration and industrialization. It was not limited to the South. It reached a peak of membership and influence in 1925. A hotbed of anti-Italian KKK activity developed in [[Southern New Jersey]] in the mid-1920s. In 1933, there was a mass protest against Italian immigrants in [[Vineland, New Jersey]], where Italians made up 20% of the city population. The KKK eventually lost all of its power in Vineland, and left the city.\n\n===Anti-Italian-American stereotyping===\n{{see also|Italian Americans#Discrimination and stereotyping}}\nSince the early decades of the 20th century, Italian Americans have been portrayed with stereotypical characterizations.<ref>Giorgio Bertellini, \"Black Hands and White Hearts: Italian Immigrants as 'Urban Racial Types' in Early American Film Culture,\" ''Urban History'' 2004 31(3): 375\u2013399</ref>  [[Italian Americans]] in contemporary U.S. society have actively objected to pervasive negative [[stereotyping]] in the mass media.

A sensational proceeding, the [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]], was held at the [[House of Lords]] in an effort to prove Caroline's adultery; since she had been living in Italy, many prosecution witnesses were from among her servants. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian prejudice in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs,<ref>Robins, pp 187\u2013188</ref> and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal.<ref>Robins, pp. 188\u2013191</ref> Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury.<ref>Robins, p. 191</ref>\n\nAnti-Italianism broke out again, in a more sustained way, a century later. After [[Benito Mussolini]]'s alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] in the late 1930s, there was a growing hostility toward everything Italian in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThe British media ridiculed the Italian capacity to fight in a war. A comic strip, which began running in 1938 in the British comic ''[[The Beano]]'', was entitled \"Musso the Wop\". The strip featured Mussolini as an arrogant buffoon.<ref name=\"The History of the Beano\">{{cite book | title=The History of the Beano|publisher=D.C. Thomson & Co.

It was a merciless satire of British [[Fascism]] and the Italians living in the United Kingdom who supported it.  The book is notable for lampooning the political enthusiasms of Mitford's sister [[Diana Mosley]], and her links with some Italians in Great Britain who promoted the [[British Union of Fascists]] of [[Oswald Mosley]].\n\nFurthermore, the announcement of Benito Mussolini's decision to side with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany in spring 1940 had a devastating effect. By order of UK Parliament, all \"aliens\" were to be interned, although there were few active [[fascism|fascists]]. The majority of the Italians in Great Britain had lived in the country peacefully for many years, and had even fought side by side with British soldiers in the First World War. Some had married British women and even taken British citizenship.\n\nThis anti-Italian feeling led to a night of nationwide riots against the Italian communities in June 1940. The Italians were now seen as a national security threat linked to the feared [[British fascism]] movement, and [[Winston Churchill]] instructed \"collar the lot!\". Thousands of Italian men between the ages of 17 and 60 were arrested after his speech.<ref>{{cite book|last= Moffat|first= Alistair|date= 2013|title= The British: A Genetic Journey|url= https://books.google.com/?id=NrO8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT217&lpg=PT217&dq=All+Italian+men+between+the+ages+of+17+and+60+were+arrested+after+his+speech#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Edinburgh, Scotland|publisher= Birlinn Limited|isbn= 978-1-78027-075-3}}</ref> They were transported to camps across the country.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==World War II==\n{{further|Italian American internment|Italian-Canadian internment}}Adolf Hitler acknowledged the ancient history of the Roman civilization.

Also see Sullivan's ''The Italian Armed Forces''.

Further, he discussed Allied and German commanders but ignored Messe, who commanded the Italian First Army, which held off both the U.S. Second Corps and the British Eighth Army in Tunisia.\n\nIn his article, ''Anglo-American Bias and the Italo-Greek War'' (1994), Sadkovich writes:\n\n<blockquote>Knox and other Anglo-American historians have not only selectively used Italian sources, they have gleaned negative observations and racist slurs and comments from British, American, and German sources and then presented them as objective depictions of Italian political and military leaders, a game that if played in reverse would yield some interesting results regarding German, American, and British competence.<ref>Sadkovich, 1994, p. 617</ref></blockquote>\n\nSadkovich also states that\n\n<blockquote>such a fixation on Germany and such denigrations of Italians not only distort analysis, they also reinforce the misunderstandings and myths that have grown up around the Greek theater and allow historians to lament and debate the impact of the Italo-Greek conflict on the British and German war efforts, yet dismiss as unimportant its impact on the Italian war effort. Because Anglo-American authors start from the assumption that Italy's war effort was secondary in importance to that of Germany, they implicitly, if unconsciously, deny even the possibility of a 'parallel war' long before Italian setbacks in late 1940, because they define Italian policy as subordinate to German from the very beginning of the war.

Its opposite is [[Italophilia]].\n\n==Anti-Italianism in the United States==\nAnti-Italianism arose among some Americans as an effect of the large-scale immigration of Italians to the United States during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.  The majority of Italian immigrants to the United States arrived in waves in the early-twentieth century, many of them from agrarian backgrounds. The majority of the Italian immigrants were [[Catholic]] [[Southern Italy|Southern Italians]] with dark features and dark or swarthy [[olive skin]], as opposed to the nation's [[Northwestern Europe]]an or [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] Protestant majority. Because Southern Italian immigrants often lacked formal education, and competed with earlier immigrants for lower-paying jobs and housing, much hostility existed toward them.<ref>Mangione, Jerre and Ben Morreale, ''La Storia \u2013 Five Centuries of the Italian American Experience'', Harper Perennial,1992</ref> The established Protestant Americans of Northwestern European ancestry aggressively displayed and acted on  [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric chauvinism]] and [[racism]] against Southern Italians based on the Italians\u2019 dark features and skin and Catholic religion, especially in the [[Southern United States|American South]], the population there being overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.  In reaction to the large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe, Congress passed legislation ([[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and [[Immigration Act of 1924]]) restricting immigration from those regions, but not from Anglo-Saxon countries.\n\nAnti-Italian prejudice was sometimes associated with the [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic]] tradition that existed in the United States, which was inherited as a result of Protestant/Catholic European competition and wars, which had been fought between Protestants and Catholics over the preceding three centuries. When the United States was founded, it inherited the anti-Catholic, anti-papal animosity of its original [[Protestantism|Protestant]] settlers. Anti-Catholic sentiments in the U.S. reached a peak in the 19th century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the large number of Catholics who were immigrating to the United States. This was due in part to the standard tensions that arise between native-born citizens and immigrants. The resulting [[Nativism (politics)#Anti-Catholic nativism in the 19th century|anti-Catholic nativist movement]], which achieved prominence in the 1840s, led to hostility that resulted in mob violence, including the burning of Catholic property.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907171941/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |archivedate=2008-09-07 }}</ref>  The Italian immigrants inherited this anti-Catholic hostility upon arrival; however, unlike some of the other Catholic immigrant groups, they generally did not bring with them priests and other religious who could help ease their transition into American life. To remedy this situation, Pope [[Leo XIII]] dispatched a contingent of priests, nuns and brothers of the [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] and other orders (among which was Sister [[Francesca Cabrini]]), who helped establish hundreds of parishes to serve the needs of the Italian communities, such as [[Our Lady of Pompeii Church (Manhattan)|Our Lady of Pompeii]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourladyofpompeiinyc.com/History|title=History - Our Lady of Pompeii NYC|website=Our Lady of Pompeii Church|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417093556/http://www.ourladyofpompeiinyc.com/History|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of the early 20th-century immigrants from Italy brought with them a political disposition toward [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]]. This was a reaction to the economic and political conditions which they had experienced in Italy. Such men as [[Arturo Giovannitti]], [[Carlo Tresca]], and [[Joe Ettor]] were in the forefront of organising Italians and other immigrant labourers in demanding better working conditions and shorter working hours in the mining, textile, garment, construction and other industries. These efforts often resulted in strikes, which sometimes erupted into violence between the strikers and strike-breakers. The anarchy movement in the United States at that time was responsible for bombings in major cities, and attacks on officials and law enforcement.<ref>Bruce Watson, ''Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream,'' New York, NY: Viking [2005]</ref> As a result of the association of some with the labour and anarchy movements, Italian Americans were branded as [[labor movement|labor agitators]] and radicals by many of the business owners and the wealthier class of the time, which resulted in anti-Italian sentiments.\n\nThe vast majority of Italian immigrants worked hard and lived honest lives, as documented by police statistics of the early-twentieth century in [[Boston]] and [[New York City]]. Italian immigrants had an arrest rate which was no greater than those of other major immigrant groups.<ref>[http://www.clevelandmemory.org/italians/partii.html, pg. 123], Cleveland Memory</ref> As late as 1963, James W. Vander Zander noted that the rate of criminal convictions among Italian immigrants was less than that among [[White Americans|American-born whites]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=W. Vander Zander|first1=James|title=American Minority Relations, quoted by Richard Gambino, Blood of My Blood|date=1974|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|pages=253\u2013254}}</ref> \n\nA criminal element which was active in some of the Italian immigrant communities which were located in the large eastern cities used extortion, intimidation and threats in order to extract [[protection money]] from the wealthier immigrants and shop owners (known as the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]] racket), and it was also involved in other illegal activities as well. When the [[Fascism in Italy|Fascists]] came to power in Italy, they made the destruction of [[the Mafia]] in [[Sicily]] a high priority ([[Sicilian Mafia during the Mussolini regime]]). Hundreds fled to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s in order to avoid prosecution.\n\nWhen the United States enacted [[Prohibition]] in 1920, the restrictions proved to be an economic windfall for those in the Italian-American community who were already involved in illegal activities, as well as those who had fled from Sicily. They smuggled liquor into the country, wholesaled and sold it through a network of outlets and speakeasies. While members of other ethnic groups were also deeply involved in these illegal bootlegging activities, and the associated violence between groups, Italian Americans were among the most notorious.<ref>Fox, Stephen,  ''Blood and Power'', William Morrow and Co., 1989</ref>  Because of this, Italians became associated with the prototypical [[gangster]] in the minds of many, which had a long-lasting effect on the Italian-American image.\n\nThe experiences of Italian immigrants in [[North America]]n countries were notably different than those in [[South America]]n countries, where many of them immigrated in large numbers. Italians were key in developing countries such as: [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. They quickly joined the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es in those countries.<ref>[http://my.lifeinitaly.com/threads/2834-Latin-American-Hyphenated-Italians-Italian-culture-in-Argentina-and-Brazil Latin American Hyphenated Italians \u2013 Italian culture in Argentina and Brazil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117052840/http://my.lifeinitaly.com/threads/2834-Latin-American-Hyphenated-Italians-Italian-culture-in-Argentina-and-Brazil |date=2011-01-17 }} at LifeInItaly.com</ref> In the U.S., Italian Americans initially encountered an established Protestant-majority Northern European culture.

Many soon found themselves the victims of prejudice, economic exploitation, and they were sometimes victims of violence. Anti-Italian stereotypes abounded during this period as a means of justifying the maltreatment of the immigrants. The plight of the Italian immigrant agricultural workers in Mississippi was so serious that the Italian embassy became involved in investigating their mistreatment in cases that were studied for [[peonage]].

During the early 20th century, the KKK became active in northern and midwestern cities, where social change had been rapid due to immigration and industrialization. It was not limited to the South. It reached a peak of membership and influence in 1925. A hotbed of anti-Italian KKK activity developed in [[Southern New Jersey]] in the mid-1920s. In 1933, there was a mass protest against Italian immigrants in [[Vineland, New Jersey]], where Italians made up 20% of the city population. The KKK eventually lost all of its power in Vineland, and left the city.\n\n===Anti-Italian-American stereotyping===\n{{see also|Italian Americans#Discrimination and stereotyping}}\nSince the early decades of the 20th century, Italian Americans have been portrayed with stereotypical characterizations.<ref>Giorgio Bertellini, \"Black Hands and White Hearts: Italian Immigrants as 'Urban Racial Types' in Early American Film Culture,\" ''Urban History'' 2004 31(3): 375\u2013399</ref>  [[Italian Americans]] in contemporary U.S. society have actively objected to pervasive negative [[stereotyping]] in the mass media.

A sensational proceeding, the [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]], was held at the [[House of Lords]] in an effort to prove Caroline's adultery; since she had been living in Italy, many prosecution witnesses were from among her servants. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian prejudice in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs,<ref>Robins, pp 187\u2013188</ref> and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal.<ref>Robins, pp. 188\u2013191</ref> Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury.<ref>Robins, p. 191</ref>\n\nAnti-Italianism broke out again, in a more sustained way, a century later. After [[Benito Mussolini]]'s alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] in the late 1930s, there was a growing hostility toward everything Italian in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThe British media ridiculed the Italian capacity to fight in a war. A comic strip, which began running in 1938 in the British comic ''[[The Beano]]'', was entitled \"Musso the Wop\". The strip featured Mussolini as an arrogant buffoon.<ref name=\"The History of the Beano\">{{cite book | title=The History of the Beano|publisher=D.C. Thomson & Co.

It was a merciless satire of British [[Fascism]] and the Italians living in the United Kingdom who supported it.  The book is notable for lampooning the political enthusiasms of Mitford's sister [[Diana Mosley]], and her links with some Italians in Great Britain who promoted the [[British Union of Fascists]] of [[Oswald Mosley]].\n\nFurthermore, the announcement of Benito Mussolini's decision to side with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany in spring 1940 had a devastating effect. By order of UK Parliament, all \"aliens\" were to be interned, although there were few active [[fascism|fascists]]. The majority of the Italians in Great Britain had lived in the country peacefully for many years, and had even fought side by side with British soldiers in the First World War. Some had married British women and even taken British citizenship.\n\nThis anti-Italian feeling led to a night of nationwide riots against the Italian communities in June 1940. The Italians were now seen as a national security threat linked to the feared [[British fascism]] movement, and [[Winston Churchill]] instructed \"collar the lot!\".

Hundreds of Italian citizens, suspected by ethnicity of potential loyalty to Italy, were put in [[internment camps]] in the U.S. and Canada. Thousands more Italian citizens in the U.S., suspected of loyalty to Italy, were placed under surveillance. [[Joe DiMaggio]]'s father, who lived in San Francisco, had his boat and house confiscated.  Unlike Japanese Americans, Italian Americans and Italian Canadians never received reparations from their respective governments, but President [[Bill Clinton]] made a public declaration admitting the U.S. government's misjudgement in the internment.<ref name=\"internment\">Di Stasi, Lawrence (2004).

Also see Sullivan's ''The Italian Armed Forces''. Sims, in ''The Fighter Pilot'', ignored the Italians, while D'Este in ''World War II in the Mediterranean'' shaped his reader's image of Italians by citing a German comment that Italy's surrender was \"the basest treachery\". Further, he discussed Allied and German commanders but ignored Messe, who commanded the Italian First Army, which held off both the U.S. Second Corps and the British Eighth Army in Tunisia.\n\nIn his article, ''Anglo-American Bias and the Italo-Greek War'' (1994), Sadkovich writes:\n\n<blockquote>Knox and other Anglo-American historians have not only selectively used Italian sources, they have gleaned negative observations and racist slurs and comments from British, American, and German sources and then presented them as objective depictions of Italian political and military leaders, a game that if played in reverse would yield some interesting results regarding German, American, and British competence.<ref>Sadkovich, 1994, p. 617</ref></blockquote>\n\nSadkovich also states that\n\n<blockquote>such a fixation on Germany and such denigrations of Italians not only distort analysis, they also reinforce the misunderstandings and myths that have grown up around the Greek theater and allow historians to lament and debate the impact of the Italo-Greek conflict on the British and German war efforts, yet dismiss as unimportant its impact on the Italian war effort. Because Anglo-American authors start from the assumption that Italy's war effort was secondary in importance to that of Germany, they implicitly, if unconsciously, deny even the possibility of a 'parallel war' long before Italian setbacks in late 1940, because they define Italian policy as subordinate to German from the very beginning of the war. Alan Levine even goes most authors one better by dismissing the whole Mediterranean theater as irrelevant, but only after duly scolding Mussolini for 'his imbecilic attack on Greece'.<ref>Sadkovich, 1993, p.617</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Anti-Italianism after World War II==\nFormer Italian communities once thrived in Italy's African colonies of [[Italian Eritreans|Eritrea]], [[Italian Somalians|Somalia]] and [[Libyan Italians|Libya]], and in the [[Italia irredenta|areas]] at the borders of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. In the aftermath of the end of imperial colonies and other political changes, many ethnic Italians were violently expelled from these areas, or left under threat of violence.\n\n[[Libya]] and [[Yugoslavia]] have shown high levels of anti-Italianism since WWII, as illustrated by the following manifestations:\n\n* ''Libya''. During the years of administering Libya as an Italian colony, some 150,000 Italians settled there, constituting about 18% of the total population.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46562/Libya Libya \u2013 Italian colonization], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref> During the rise of independence movements, hostility increased against colonists. All of [[Libya]]'s remaining ethnic Italians were expelled from Libya in 1970, a year after [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] seized power (a \"day of vengeance\" on 7 October 1970).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4380360.stm \"Libya cuts ties to mark Italy era\"], BBC</ref>\n* ''Yugoslavia''. At the end of [[World War II]], former Italian territories in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] became part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] by the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947]]. Economic insecurity, ethnic hatred and the international political context that eventually led to the [[Iron Curtain]] resulted in up to 350,000 people, nearly all ethnic [[Italians]], choosing to or being forced to [[Istrian exodus|leave the region]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/world/election-opens-old-wounds-in-trieste.html \"Election Opens Old Wounds In Trieste\"], ''New York Times''</ref><ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7366.html ''History in Exile: Memory and Identity at the Borders of the Balkans''], Princeton University Press</ref> Scholars such as [[R.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} Throughout his teen years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\", always assisting his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906, soon gravitating toward that organisation's radical [[Bolshevik]] faction, headed by [[V. I. Lenin]].<ref name=Roberts5>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior.''

In 1911, he enrolled at [[St Petersburg]] Polytechnic. Molotov joined the editorial staff of a new underground Bolshevik newspaper called ''[[Pravda]]'', meeting [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time in association with the project.<ref name=Roberts6>Roberts, ''Molotov'', pg. 6.</ref> This first association between the two future Soviet leaders proved to be brief, however, and did not lead to an immediate close political association.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\n[[File:Molotov VM.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Molotov in 1917]]\n\nMolotov worked as a so-called \"professional revolutionary\" for the next several years, writing for the party press and attempting to better organize the underground party.<ref name=Roberts6 /> He moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1914 at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> It was in Moscow the following year that Molotov was again arrested for his party activity, this time being deported to [[Irkutsk]] in eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> In 1916, he escaped from his Siberian exile and returned to the capital city, now called Petrograd by the Tsarist regime, which thought the name St. Petersburg sounded excessively German.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\nMolotov became a member of the Bolshevik Party's committee in [[Petrograd]] in 1916. When the [[February Revolution]] occurred in 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital.

Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Orgburo]], and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in 1921 and held the office of [[Responsible Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Responsible Secretary]] and also married the Soviet politician [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]].\n\nHis Responsible Secretaryship was criticised by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], with Lenin noting his \"shameful bureaucratism\" and stupid behaviour.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} On the advice of Molotov and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=151}} In 1922, Stalin became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party]] with Molotov as the ''de facto'' [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]].

Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Hitler's Germany could only develop if Germany's policy changed. Molotov then stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was by re-joining the [[League of Nations]], but even that was not sufficient. Germany still had to give proof 'of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov and the Sovnarkom 1930\u20131941|last=Watson|first=Derek|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> As Litvinov during 1933 and 1934 had done his best to prevent the cordial relations created by Rapallo from declining, some do not think Litvinov would have disapproved of that statement; and if German policy had changed, Litvinov would have been delighted. However, Robert Conquest, unlike Watson, believed that the reason for Stalin's temporary rift with Molotov was not concerned with foreign policy but stemmed from the fact that Stalin was incensed with Molotov for attempting to try and dissuade Stalin from staging the famous trials against the old colleagues of Lenin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Terror|last=Conquest|first=Robert|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref> Molotov, in the same interview, denied the continued existence of internal enemies except for a few isolated cases.

In his book ''Crisis in the Kremlin'', he states:\n\n<blockquote>It is well known in Moscow that Molotov always detested Litvinov.  Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.  Litvinov had no respect for a small minded intriguer and accomplice in terror like Molotov, and Molotov for his part had no love for Litvinov, who incidentally was the one people's commissioner to retain his independence.<ref>Medvedev All Stalin's Men p.488</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Purge Stalin Voroshilov Kaganovich Zhdanov Molotov.jpg|thumb|A list from the [[Great Purge]] signed by Molotov, Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]|293x293px]]\n\nMolotov was succeeded in his post as Premier by Stalin.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nAt first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.\n\nThe most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and the [[Baltic States]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of [[Bessarabia]] (then part of [[Romania]], now [[Moldova]]).{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], which began on 1 September.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90\u201392}} On 5 March 1940, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] gave Molotov, along with [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin, a note proposing the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and [[anti-Soviet]]s, in what has become known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nUnder the Pact's terms, Hitler was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy two-thirds of [[Western Poland]], as well as [[Lithuania]]. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the [[Winter War]] that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence.{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=256\u2013257}} The Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland.

In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] visited Turkey in an attempt to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the [[Crimea]]. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that, on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 276\u2013286 }}</ref>\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]]]] \nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158\u2013160}} Molotov was responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war.

He took a secret flight to [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], where he was greeted by Eden. This risky flight, in a high altitude [[Tupolev TB-7]] bomber, flew over German-occupied [[Denmark]] and the [[North Sea]]. From there, he took a train to London to discuss with the [[British government]] the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.\n\nAfter signing the [[Anglo\u2013Soviet Treaty of 1942]] on 26 May, Molotov left for Washington, D.C., in the United States. Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, and ratified a [[Lend-Lease]] Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the [[United States government]], albeit vaguely, promised to open up a second front against Germany.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]]. The plan created several [[bilateral relation]]s between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA).<ref>{{Cite book | author = Roberts, Geoffrey | title = The Soviet Union in world politics: coexistence, revolution, and cold war, 1945\u20131991 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 284\u2013285 | authorlink = Geoffrey Roberts }}</ref>\n\nIn the postwar period, Molotov's power began to decline.

Immediately afterwards, Polina was arrested and accused of ties with [[Zionist]] organisations. She was imprisoned for a year in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]], after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed. Polina was freed immediately after the death of Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}} According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: \"She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in the Soviet Union; she's also a real [[Bolshevik]], a real Soviet person.\" \n[[File:Polina Zhemchuzhina.jpg|thumb|Molotov with his wife [[Polina Zhemchuzhina|Polina]]]]\nHowever Polina's feelings were not reciprocal.

Holroyd-Doveton has discovered a statement by the Italian Communist Vittorio Vidali that he was told by Yelena Dmitryevna at the 20th Congress that Polina refused to return to her husband.  It is hardly surprising.  It is difficult to believe any wife would not be infuriated if they were being tortured while their husband was holding high political office.

He was buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]], in Moscow.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=669}}\n\n===Legacy===\nMolotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, and because of it, much crucial information disappeared. As Molotov once said, \"''One should listen to them, but it is necessary to check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere''\".{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=88}} Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics \u2013 Conversations with Felix Cheuv|last=Felix|first=Chuev|publisher=|year=1993|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages= 4}}</ref> Like Stalin, he never recognised the [[Cold War]] as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the \"''smart and dangerous [[imperialists]]''\" and the \"''fools''\".{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=89}} Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed [[socialist state]]s were part of a bigger, [[Supranational union|supranational entity]].{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|pp=90\u201391}} In retirement, Molotov criticised [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for being a \"''right-wing deviationist''\".{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=90}}\n\nThe [[Molotov cocktail]] is a term coined by the [[Finns]] during the [[Winter War]], as a generic name used for a variety of [[Improvization|improvised]] [[Incendiary device|incendiary weapons]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=335}} During the Winter War, the Soviet air force made extensive use of [[incendiaries]] and [[cluster bombs]] against Finnish troops and fortifications. When Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that they were not bombing, but rather delivering food to the [[starvation|starving]] Finns, the Finns started to call the air bombs \"''[[Molotov bread basket]]s''\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Langdon-Davies|first=John|date=June 1940|title=The Lessons of Finland|journal=[[Picture Post]]|authorlink=John Langdon-Davies}}</ref> Soon they responded by attacking advancing tanks with \"''Molotov cocktails''\", which were \"''a drink to go with the food''\". According to Montefiore, the Molotov cocktail was one part of Molotov's [[cult of personality]] that the vain Premier surely did not appreciate.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=328}}\n\n[[Winston Churchill]] in his wartime memoirs lists many meetings with Molotov.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} Throughout his teen years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\", always assisting his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906, soon gravitating toward that organisation's radical [[Bolshevik]] faction, headed by [[V. I. Lenin]].<ref name=Roberts5>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior.''

Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.

Consequently, an engineering model can be tested in a [[wind tunnel]] or [[water tunnel (hydrodynamic)|water tunnel]], pressure coefficients can be determined at critical locations around the model, and these pressure coefficients can be used with confidence to predict the fluid pressure at those critical locations around a full-size aircraft or boat.\n\n==Definition==\nThe pressure coefficient is a parameter for studying both incompressible/compressible fluids such as water and air.

In 1908, having invented a military rangefinder and convinced [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] to manufacture it, Wild moved to the city of [[Jena]] and became head of the new Zeiss branch responsible for surveying instruments, GEO.\n\nWild returned to Switzerland after the First World War.<ref>[http://www.wild-heerbrugg.com/History.htm Wild Heerbrugg History]</ref>  In April 1921, with Colonel Jacob Schmidheiny of Balgach and geologist Dr. Robert Helbling of Flums and with the help of Swiss financiers, he founded the ''Heinrich Wild, Werkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr Feinmechanik und Optik'' in [[Heerbrugg]] in the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]]. In the early 1930s, having recognized that he was not cut out to be a factory manager, Wild moved to [[Zurich]], severed his connections with the firm in Heerbrugg, and designed instruments for [[Kern & Co]] in Aarau. His old firm became Wild Heerbrugg in 1937.\n\nIt merged with the optical firm of [[Ernst Leitz]] of [[Wetzlar]] in 1987, acquired a majority interest in Kern in 1988, was renamed '''Wild Leitz AG''' in 1989, and became part of the Leica holding company in 1990. Starting in 1996, the company was divided gradually into smaller units.  Thus in 1996, [[Leica Camera]] AG was founded, followed in October 1997 by '''Leica Geosystems''' AG, and on April 1, 1998 by [[Leica Microsystems]] AG. The Swedish company [[Hexagon AB]] purchased Leica Geosystems in late 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.com/hexagon/acquisition-of-outstanding-leica-shares-and-resolution-on-new-issue|title=Hexagon - Press release|publisher=[[Cision|Cision Wire]]|accessdate=2005-12-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722190549/http://www.cisionwire.com/hexagon/acquisition-of-outstanding-leica-shares-and-resolution-on-new-issue|archivedate=2012-07-22}}</ref>\n\nToday these three companies are all independent public companies.

In 1908, having invented a military rangefinder and convinced [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] to manufacture it, Wild moved to the city of [[Jena]] and became head of the new Zeiss branch responsible for surveying instruments, GEO.\n\nWild returned to Switzerland after the First World War.<ref>[http://www.wild-heerbrugg.com/History.htm Wild Heerbrugg History]</ref>  In April 1921, with Colonel Jacob Schmidheiny of Balgach and geologist Dr. Robert Helbling of Flums and with the help of Swiss financiers, he founded the ''Heinrich Wild, Werkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr Feinmechanik und Optik'' in [[Heerbrugg]] in the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]]. In the early 1930s, having recognized that he was not cut out to be a factory manager, Wild moved to [[Zurich]], severed his connections with the firm in Heerbrugg, and designed instruments for [[Kern & Co]] in Aarau. His old firm became Wild Heerbrugg in 1937.\n\nIt merged with the optical firm of [[Ernst Leitz]] of [[Wetzlar]] in 1987, acquired a majority interest in Kern in 1988, was renamed '''Wild Leitz AG''' in 1989, and became part of the Leica holding company in 1990. Starting in 1996, the company was divided gradually into smaller units.  Thus in 1996, [[Leica Camera]] AG was founded, followed in October 1997 by '''Leica Geosystems''' AG, and on April 1, 1998 by [[Leica Microsystems]] AG.

{"title_page": "Present perfect", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}{{English grammar}}\nThe '''present perfect ''' is a grammatical combination of the [[present tense]] and [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspect that is used to express a past event that has present consequences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/easy-learning/the-present-perfect-tense|title=The present perfect tense {{!}} Learning English Grammar {{!}} Collins Education|website=grammar.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref> The term is used particularly in the context of [[English grammar]] to refer to forms like \"I have finished\"janaatayagafathaagfsususfsfahajahvshshabaa\n. The forms are ''present'' because they use the present tense of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''have'', and ''perfect'' because they use that auxiliary in combination with the [[past participle]] of the main verb. (Other perfect constructions also exist, such as the [[past perfect]]: \"I had eaten.\")\n\nAnalogous forms are found in some other languages, and they may also be described as present perfect; they often have other names such as the German ''Perfekt'', the French ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' and the Italian ''passato prossimo''. They may also have different ranges of usage: in all three of the languages just mentioned, the forms in question serve as a general past tense, at least for completed actions.\n\nIn English, completed actions in many contexts are referred to using the [[simple past]] verb form rather than the present perfect. English also has a [[present perfect continuous]] (or present perfect progressive) form, which combines present tense with both perfect aspect and [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous]] (progressive) [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]: \"I have been eating\". The action is not necessarily complete; and the same is true of certain uses of the basic present perfect when the verb expresses a state or a habitual action: \"I have lived here for five years.\"\n\n==Auxiliaries==\nIn modern English, the [[auxiliary verb]] used to form the present perfect is always ''to have''. A typical present perfect clause thus  consists of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], the auxiliary ''have/has'', and the [[English verbs|past participle]] (third form) of  main verb. Examples:\n*I '''have done''' so much in my life.\n*You '''have gone''' to school.\n*He '''has''' already '''arrived''' in America.\n*He '''has had''' child after child... (''[[The Mask of Anarchy]]'', Percy Shelley)\n*Lovely tales that we '''have heard or read'''... (''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]'', John Keats)\n\n[[Early Modern English]] used both ''to have'' and ''to be'' as perfect auxiliaries. The usage differs in that ''to have'' expressed emphasis in the process of the action that was completed, whereas ''to be'' put the emphasis in the final state after the action is completed. Examples of the second can be found in older texts:\n*Madam, the Lady Valeria '''is come''' to visit you. (''[[The Tragedy of Coriolanus]]'', Shakespeare)\n*Vext the dim sea: I '''am become''' a name... (''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', Tennyson)\n*I '''am become''' Time, destroyer of worlds. (''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'')\n*Pillars '''are fallen''' at thy feet... (''Marius amid the Ruins of Carthage'', [[Lydia Maria Child]])\n*I '''am come''' in sorrow. (''[[Lord Jim]]'', Conrad)\n*I '''am come''' in my Father's name, and ye receive me not (''John 5:43'', The Bible)\n\nIn many other European languages, the equivalent of ''to have'' (e.g. German ''haben'', French ''avoir'', Italian ''avere'') is used to form the present perfect (or their equivalent of the present perfect) for most or all verbs. However, the equivalent of ''to be'' (e.g. German ''sein'', French ''\u00eatre'', Italian ''essere'') serves as the auxiliary for other verbs in some languages, such as German, Dutch, Danish (but not Swedish or Norwegian), French, and Italian (but not Spanish or Portuguese). Generally, the verbs that take ''to be'' as an auxiliary are [[intransitive verb]]s denoting motion or change of state (e.g. ''to arrive, to go, to fall'').\n\nFor more details, see [[Perfect_(grammar)#Construction_with_auxiliaries|Perfect construction with auxiliaries]].\n\n==English==\n{{ExamplesSidebar|40%|\n1) Actions started in the past and continuing in the present:\n*We '''have lived''' in Sapporo for eleven years. \n2) When the time period referred to has not finished:\n*It '''has rained''' a lot this year.\n3) Actions repeated in an unspecified period between the past and now:\n*We '''have eaten''' at that restaurant many times.\n4) Actions completed in the very recent past (+just):\n*'''Have''' you just '''finished''' work?\n5) When the precise time of the action is not important or not known:\n*She '''has studied''' Japanese, Russian and English.\n}}\nThe present perfect in English is used chiefly for completed past actions or events when it is understood that it is the present result of the events that is focused upon, rather than the moment of completion. No particular past time frame is specified for the action/event. When a past time frame (a point of time in the past, or period of time which ended in the past) is specified for the event, explicitly or implicitly, the [[simple past]] is used rather than the present perfect.\n\nThe tense may be said to be a sort of mixture of present and past. It always implies a strong connection with the present and is used chiefly in conversations, letters, newspapers and TV and radio reports.<ref name=\"ThomsonMartinet1993\">{{cite book|author1=Audrey J. Thomson|author2=Agnes V. Martinet|title=A Practical English Grammar|url=https://archive.org/details/practicalenglish00thom|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-562053-5}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be used for ongoing or habitual situations continuing up to the present time (generally not completed, but the present time may be the moment of completion). That usage describes for how long or since when something has been the case, normally based on time expressions with \"for\" or \"since\" (such as for two years, since 1995). Then, the [[present perfect continuous]] form is often used, if a continuing action is being described.\n\nFor examples, see {{slink|Uses of English verb forms|Present perfect}} as well as the sections of that article relating to the simple past, present perfect continuous, and other perfect forms.\n\n==German==\nModern German has lost its perfect aspect in the present tense. The present perfect form implies the perfective aspect and colloquially usually replaces the simple past (except in the verb ''sein'' \"to be\"), but the simple past still is frequently used in non-colloquial and/or narrative [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]].\n\nThe present perfect form is often called in German the \"conversational past\" while the simple past is often called the \"narrative past\".\n\nIn Standard German, the ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]''-vs-''[[wikt:haben#German|haben]]'' distinction includes the intransitive-+-motion idea for ''sein'' (\"to be\") usage but is independent of the reflexive-voice difference when forming the ''Perfekt''.\n*''Ich habe gegessen'' (I have eaten)\n*''Du bist gekommen'' (You have come, literally ''you are come.'')\n*''Sie sind gefallen'' (They have fallen, literally ''they are fallen.'')\n*''Sie ist geschwommen'' (She has swum, literally, ''she is swum.'')\n*''Du hast dich beeilt'' (You have hurried, literally ''You have yourself hurried'')\n\n==French==\nFrench has no present perfect aspect. However, it has a grammatical form that is constructed in the same way as is the present perfect in English, Spanish, and Portuguese by using a conjugated form of (usually) ''avoir'' \"to have\" plus a past participle. The term ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' (literally \"compound past\") is the standard name for this form, which has [[perfective aspect]] rather than [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspect. The French simple past form, which also conveys perfective aspect, is analogous to the German simple past in that it has been largely displaced by the compound past and relegated to narrative usage.\n\nIn standard French, a verb that is used [[Reflexive verb|reflexively]] takes ''[[wikt:\u00eatre#French|\u00eatre]]'' (\"to be\") rather than ''avoir'' (\"to have\") as auxiliary in compound past tenses ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]], plus-que-parfait, pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur, futur ant\u00e9rieur). In addition, a small set of about 20 non-reflexive verbs also use ''\u00eatre'' as auxiliary (some students memorize these using the acrostic mnemonic \"DR & MRS VAN DER TRAMP\").\n*''J'ai mang\u00e9'' (I have eaten)\n*''Tu es venu(e)'' (You have come, literally ''you are come.'')\n*''Nous sommes arriv\u00e9(e)s'' (We have arrived, literally ''we are arrived.'')\n*''Vous vous \u00eates lev\u00e9(e)(s)'' (You have got up, reflexive verb, literally ''you have raised yourself/selves'')\n\n==Spanish==\nThe Spanish present perfect form conveys a true perfect aspect. Standard Spanish is like modern English in that ''haber'' is always the auxiliary regardless of the reflexive voice and regardless of the verb in question:\n\nI have eaten (''Yo he comido'')\n\nThey have gone (''Ellos han ido'')\n\nHe has played (''\u00c9l ha jugado'')\n\nSpanish differs from French, German, and English in that its ''have'' word, ''haber'', serves only as auxiliary in the modern language; it does not denote possession, which is handled by the verb ''tener''.\n\nIn some forms of Spanish, such as the [[Rio Platense Spanish]] spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, the present perfect is rarely used: the simple past replaces it. In [[Castilian Spanish]], however, the present perfect is normal when talking about events that occur \"today\".\n\nFor example, to refer to \"this morning\", one would say, ''Me he levantado tarde y no me ha dado tiempo de desayunar ''(I woke up late and did not have time to eat breakfast) rather than ''Me levant\u00e9 tarde y no me dio tiempo de desayunar''. With no context, listeners from Spain would assume that the latter occurred yesterday or a long time ago. For the same reason, speakers of Castilian Spanish use the present perfect to talk about the immediate past (events having occurred only a few moments ago), such as ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 has dicho? No te he podido o\u00edr'' rather than ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 dijiste? No te pude o\u00edr.'' (What did you say? I couldn't hear you.)\n\n==Portuguese==\nThe Portuguese present perfect form conveys a true perfect aspect. Modern Portuguese differs from Spanish in that the auxiliary used is normally ''ter'' (Spanish ''tener'') rather than ''haver'' (Spanish ''haber''). Furthermore, the meaning of the present perfect is different from that in Spanish in that it implies an [[iterative aspect]].<ref name=Comrie>Comrie, Bernard, ''Tense'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985.</ref>{{rp|pp. 80\u201381}} ''Eu tenho comido'' translates \"I have been eating\" rather than \"I have eaten\". (However, other tenses are still as in Spanish: ''eu tinha comido'' means \"I had eaten\" in modern Portuguese, like Spanish ''yo hab\u00eda comido''.)\n\nThe perfect aspect may be indicated lexically by using the simple past form of the verb, preceded by \"j\u00e1\" (already): ''Eu j\u00e1 comi'' (Lit: \"I already ate\") connotes \"I have already eaten\".\n\nE.g.: '''Ele j\u00e1 foi, como sabem, duas vezes candidato ao Pr\u00e9mio Sakharov, que \u00e9 atribu\u00eddo anualmente por este Parlamento.'''\n\n''He has, as you know, already been nominated twice for the Sakharov Prize, which this Parliament awards each year.''\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]\" in the name comes from a Latin root referring to completion, rather than to perfection in the sense of \"having no flaws\". (In fact this \"flawless\" sense of ''perfect'' evolved by extension from the former sense, because something being created is finished when it no longer has any flaws.) Perfect tenses are named thus because they refer to actions that are finished with respect to the present (or some other time under consideration); for example, \"I have eaten all the bread\" refers to an action which is, as of now, completed. However, as seen above, not all uses of present perfect constructions involve an idea of completion.\n\nIn the grammar of languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek, the form most closely corresponding to the English \"present perfect\" is known simply as the ''perfect''.

When a past time frame (a point of time in the past, or period of time which ended in the past) is specified for the event, explicitly or implicitly, the [[simple past]] is used rather than the present perfect.\n\nThe tense may be said to be a sort of mixture of present and past. It always implies a strong connection with the present and is used chiefly in conversations, letters, newspapers and TV and radio reports.<ref name=\"ThomsonMartinet1993\">{{cite book|author1=Audrey J. Thomson|author2=Agnes V. Martinet|title=A Practical English Grammar|url=https://archive.org/details/practicalenglish00thom|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-562053-5}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be used for ongoing or habitual situations continuing up to the present time (generally not completed, but the present time may be the moment of completion). That usage describes for how long or since when something has been the case, normally based on time expressions with \"for\" or \"since\" (such as for two years, since 1995). Then, the [[present perfect continuous]] form is often used, if a continuing action is being described.\n\nFor examples, see {{slink|Uses of English verb forms|Present perfect}} as well as the sections of that article relating to the simple past, present perfect continuous, and other perfect forms.\n\n==German==\nModern German has lost its perfect aspect in the present tense. The present perfect form implies the perfective aspect and colloquially usually replaces the simple past (except in the verb ''sein'' \"to be\"), but the simple past still is frequently used in non-colloquial and/or narrative [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]].\n\nThe present perfect form is often called in German the \"conversational past\" while the simple past is often called the \"narrative past\".\n\nIn Standard German, the ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]''-vs-''[[wikt:haben#German|haben]]'' distinction includes the intransitive-+-motion idea for ''sein'' (\"to be\") usage but is independent of the reflexive-voice difference when forming the ''Perfekt''.\n*''Ich habe gegessen'' (I have eaten)\n*''Du bist gekommen'' (You have come, literally ''you are come.'')\n*''Sie sind gefallen'' (They have fallen, literally ''they are fallen.'')\n*''Sie ist geschwommen'' (She has swum, literally, ''she is swum.'')\n*''Du hast dich beeilt'' (You have hurried, literally ''You have yourself hurried'')\n\n==French==\nFrench has no present perfect aspect. However, it has a grammatical form that is constructed in the same way as is the present perfect in English, Spanish, and Portuguese by using a conjugated form of (usually) ''avoir'' \"to have\" plus a past participle. The term ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' (literally \"compound past\") is the standard name for this form, which has [[perfective aspect]] rather than [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspect. The French simple past form, which also conveys perfective aspect, is analogous to the German simple past in that it has been largely displaced by the compound past and relegated to narrative usage.\n\nIn standard French, a verb that is used [[Reflexive verb|reflexively]] takes ''[[wikt:\u00eatre#French|\u00eatre]]'' (\"to be\") rather than ''avoir'' (\"to have\") as auxiliary in compound past tenses ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]], plus-que-parfait, pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur, futur ant\u00e9rieur). In addition, a small set of about 20 non-reflexive verbs also use ''\u00eatre'' as auxiliary (some students memorize these using the acrostic mnemonic \"DR & MRS VAN DER TRAMP\").\n*''J'ai mang\u00e9'' (I have eaten)\n*''Tu es venu(e)'' (You have come, literally ''you are come.'')\n*''Nous sommes arriv\u00e9(e)s'' (We have arrived, literally ''we are arrived.'')\n*''Vous vous \u00eates lev\u00e9(e)(s)'' (You have got up, reflexive verb, literally ''you have raised yourself/selves'')\n\n==Spanish==\nThe Spanish present perfect form conveys a true perfect aspect. Standard Spanish is like modern English in that ''haber'' is always the auxiliary regardless of the reflexive voice and regardless of the verb in question:\n\nI have eaten (''Yo he comido'')\n\nThey have gone (''Ellos han ido'')\n\nHe has played (''\u00c9l ha jugado'')\n\nSpanish differs from French, German, and English in that its ''have'' word, ''haber'', serves only as auxiliary in the modern language; it does not denote possession, which is handled by the verb ''tener''.\n\nIn some forms of Spanish, such as the [[Rio Platense Spanish]] spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, the present perfect is rarely used: the simple past replaces it. In [[Castilian Spanish]], however, the present perfect is normal when talking about events that occur \"today\".\n\nFor example, to refer to \"this morning\", one would say, ''Me he levantado tarde y no me ha dado tiempo de desayunar ''(I woke up late and did not have time to eat breakfast) rather than ''Me levant\u00e9 tarde y no me dio tiempo de desayunar''. With no context, listeners from Spain would assume that the latter occurred yesterday or a long time ago. For the same reason, speakers of Castilian Spanish use the present perfect to talk about the immediate past (events having occurred only a few moments ago), such as ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 has dicho? No te he podido o\u00edr'' rather than ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 dijiste? No te pude o\u00edr.'' (What did you say? I couldn't hear you.)\n\n==Portuguese==\nThe Portuguese present perfect form conveys a true perfect aspect. Modern Portuguese differs from Spanish in that the auxiliary used is normally ''ter'' (Spanish ''tener'') rather than ''haver'' (Spanish ''haber''). Furthermore, the meaning of the present perfect is different from that in Spanish in that it implies an [[iterative aspect]].<ref name=Comrie>Comrie, Bernard, ''Tense'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985.</ref>{{rp|pp. 80\u201381}} ''Eu tenho comido'' translates \"I have been eating\" rather than \"I have eaten\". (However, other tenses are still as in Spanish: ''eu tinha comido'' means \"I had eaten\" in modern Portuguese, like Spanish ''yo hab\u00eda comido''.)\n\nThe perfect aspect may be indicated lexically by using the simple past form of the verb, preceded by \"j\u00e1\" (already): ''Eu j\u00e1 comi'' (Lit: \"I already ate\") connotes \"I have already eaten\".\n\nE.g.: '''Ele j\u00e1 foi, como sabem, duas vezes candidato ao Pr\u00e9mio Sakharov, que \u00e9 atribu\u00eddo anualmente por este Parlamento.'''\n\n''He has, as you know, already been nominated twice for the Sakharov Prize, which this Parliament awards each year.''\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]\" in the name comes from a Latin root referring to completion, rather than to perfection in the sense of \"having no flaws\". (In fact this \"flawless\" sense of ''perfect'' evolved by extension from the former sense, because something being created is finished when it no longer has any flaws.) Perfect tenses are named thus because they refer to actions that are finished with respect to the present (or some other time under consideration); for example, \"I have eaten all the bread\" refers to an action which is, as of now, completed. However, as seen above, not all uses of present perfect constructions involve an idea of completion.\n\nIn the grammar of languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek, the form most closely corresponding to the English \"present perfect\" is known simply as the ''perfect''.
