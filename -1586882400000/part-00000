Antony was appointed administrator of Italy while Caesar eliminated political opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain. After [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's death]] in 44 BC, Antony joined forces with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], another of Caesar's generals, and [[Augustus|Octavian]], Caesar's great-nephew and adopted son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the [[Second Triumvirate]]. The Triumvirs defeated Caesar's murderers, the [[Liberatores]], at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, and divided the government of the Republic between themselves. Antony was assigned Rome's eastern provinces, including the [[Client state|client kingdom]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]], then ruled by [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII Philopator]], and was given the command in [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars|Rome's war against Parthia]].\n\nRelations among the triumvirs were strained as the various members sought greater political power. Civil war between Antony and Octavian was averted in 40 BC, when Antony married Octavian's sister, [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]. Despite this marriage, Antony carried on a love affair with Cleopatra, who bore him three children, further straining Antony's relations with Octavian. [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] was expelled from the association in 36 BC, and in 33 BC disagreements between Antony and Octavian caused a split between the remaining Triumvirs.  Their ongoing hostility erupted into [[Final War of the Roman Republic|civil war]] in 31 BC, as the [[Roman Senate]], at Octavian's direction, declared war on Cleopatra and proclaimed Antony a traitor. Later that year, Antony was defeated by Octavian's forces at the [[Battle of Actium]]. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt, where they committed [[suicide]].\n\nWith Antony dead, Octavian became the undisputed master of the Roman world. In 27 BC, Octavian was granted the title of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]],'' marking the final stage in the transformation of the Roman Republic into an empire, with himself as the first [[Roman emperor]].\n\n==Early life==\nA member of the [[Plebs|plebeian]] [[Antonia (gens)|Antonia gens]], Antony was born in [[Rome]] on 14 January 83 BC.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Antony'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#86.5 86.5.]</ref><ref>Suerbaum 1980, 327\u201334.</ref> His father and namesake was [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]], son of the noted [[Marcus Antonius (orator)|orator by the same name]] who had been murdered during the [[Gaius Marius#Seventh consulship and death|Marian Terror]] of the winter of 87\u201386 BC.<ref name=\"Huzar-14\">Huzar 1978, p. 14</ref> His mother was [[Julia Antonia]], a third cousin of [[Julius Caesar]].

Years earlier in 63 BC, the Roman general [[Pompey]] had captured him and his father, King [[Aristobulus II]], during his war against the remnant of the [[Seleucid Empire]].

[[Pharaoh]] [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] had been deposed in a rebellion led by his daughter [[Berenice IV of Egypt|Berenice IV]] in 58 BC, forcing him to seek asylum in Rome. During Pompey's conquests years earlier, Ptolemy had received the support of Pompey, who named him an ally of Rome.<ref>Siani-Davis, 1997, p. 316</ref> Gabinius' invasion sought to restore Ptolemy to his throne. This was done against the orders of the Senate but with the approval of Pompey, then Rome's leading politician, and only after the deposed king provided a 10,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] bribe. The Greek historian [[Plutarch]] records it was Antony who convinced Gabinius to finally act.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 3\"/> After defeating the frontier forces of the Egyptian kingdom, Gabinius's army proceeded to attack the palace guards but they surrendered before a battle commenced.<ref>Bradford, 2000, p. 43</ref> With Ptolemy XII restored as Rome's client king, Gabinius garrisoned two thousand Roman soldiers, later known as the ''[[Gabiniani]]'', in Alexandria to ensure Ptolemy's authority. In return for its support, Rome exercised considerable power over the kingdom's affairs, particularly control of the kingdom's revenues and crop yields.<ref>Siani-Davis, 1997, 388</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign in Egypt, Antony first met [[Cleopatra]], the 14-year-old daughter of Ptolemy XII.\n\nWhile Antony was serving Gabinius in the East, the domestic political situation had changed in Rome. In 60 BC, a [[First Triumvirate|secret agreement]] (known as the \"First Triumvirate\") was entered into between three men to control the Republic: [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]], and [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. Crassus, Rome's wealthiest man, had defeated the [[Third Servile War|slave rebellion of Spartacus]] in 70 BC; Pompey [[Third Mithridatic War|conquered much of the Eastern Mediterranean]] in the 60's BC; Caesar was Rome's [[Pontifex Maximus]] and a former general in [[Roman Spain|Spain]]. In 59 BC, Caesar, with funding from Crassus, was elected Consul to pursue legislation favourable to Crassus and Pompey's interests. In return, Caesar was assigned the governorship of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Cisalpine Gaul]], and [[Transalpine Gaul]] for five years beginning in 58 BC. Caesar used his governorship as a launching point for his [[Gallic Wars|conquest of free Gaul]]. In 55 BC, Crassus and Pompey served as Consuls while Caesar's command was extended for another five years. Rome was effectively under the absolute power of these three men.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 27\u201331</ref><ref>Martin, 2003, pp. 174\u201377</ref> The Triumvirate used [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], Antony's patron, to exile their political rivals, notably Cicero<ref>Haskell, 1964, p. 201</ref> and [[Cato the Younger]].\n\nDuring his early military service, Antony married his cousin [[Antonia Hybrida Minor]], the daughter of [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]]. Sometime between 54 and 47 BC, the union produced a single daughter, [[Antonia (daughter of Mark Antony)|Antonia Prima]]. It is unclear if this was Antony's first marriage.{{#tag:ref|Cicero is the only ancient source to mention a first marriage to an otherwise unknown Fadia (''Philippics'', XIII, 10)|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===Service under Caesar===\n\n====Gallic Wars====\n{{see also|Gallic Wars}}\n[[File:Europe -50.png|thumb|350px|right|The ancient Mediterranean in 50 BC at the end of Caesar's [[Gallic Wars]], with the territory of Rome in yellow.]]\n\nAntony's association with [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] allowed him to achieve greater prominence. Clodius, through the influence of his benefactor [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had developed a positive political relationship with [[Julius Caesar]]. Clodius secured Antony a position on Caesar's [[military staff]] in 54 BC, joining his [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]]. Serving under Caesar, Antony demonstrated excellent military leadership. Despite a temporary alienation later in life, Antony and Caesar developed friendly relations which would continue until Caesar's assassination in 44 BC. Caesar's influence secured greater political advancement for Antony. After a year of service in Gaul, Caesar dispatched Antony to Rome to formally begin his [[cursus honorum|political career]], receiving election as [[Quaestor]] for 52 BC as a member of the [[Populares]] faction. Assigned to assist Caesar, Antony returned to Gaul and commanded Caesar's cavalry during his victory at the [[Battle of Alesia]] against the Gallic High King [[Vercingetorix]]. Following his year in office, Antony was promoted by Caesar to the rank of [[Legatus|Legate]] and assigned command of two legions (approximately 7,500 total soldiers).<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, p. 33</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the alliance among Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus had effectively ended. Caesar's daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], who had married Pompey to secure the alliance, died in 54 BC while Crassus was killed at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC. Without the stability they provided, the divide between Caesar and Pompey grew ever larger.<ref name=\"Holland, Rubicon, p. 287\">Holland, Rubicon, p. 287</ref> Caesar's glory in conquering Gaul had served to further strain his alliance with Pompey,<ref name=\"Holland, Rubicon, p. 287\"/> who, having grown jealous of his former ally, had drifted away from Caesar's democratic Populares party towards the oligarchic [[Optimates]] faction led by Cato. The supporters of Caesar, led by Clodius, and the supporters of Pompey, led by [[Titus Annius Milo]], routinely clashed. In 52 BC, Milo succeeded in assassinating Clodius, resulting in widespread riots and the burning of the Senate meeting house, the [[Curia Hostilia]], by Clodius' street gang. [[Anarchy]] resulted, causing the Senate to look to Pompey. Fearing the persecutions of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] only thirty-years earlier, they avoided granting Pompey the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] by instead naming him sole Consul for the year, giving him extraordinary but limited powers. Pompey ordered armed soldiers into the city to restore order and to eliminate the remnants of Clodius' gang.<ref>Gruen, 1974, pp. 233\u201334</ref>\n\nAntony remained on Caesar's military staff until 50 BC, helping mopping-up actions across Gaul to secure Caesar's conquest. With the war over, Antony was sent back to Rome to act as Caesar's protector against Pompey and the other Optimates. With the support of Caesar, who as [[Pontifex Maximus]] was head of the Roman religion, Antony was appointed the [[augur|College of Augurs]], an important priestly office responsible for interpreting the will of the [[Roman gods]] by studying the flight of birds. All public actions required favorable auspices, granting the college considerable influence. Antony was then elected as one of the ten [[Tribune of the Plebs|People's Tribunes]] for 49 BC. In this position, Antony could protect Caesar from his political enemies by vetoing any actions unfavorable to his patron.\n\n====Civil War====\n{{see also|Caesar's Civil War}}\n[[File:Marcus Porcius Cato.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Cato the Younger]], a member of the [[Optimates]] faction, was one of the chief architects of the decree which provoked Caesar into civil war.]]\n\nThe feud between Caesar and Pompey erupted into open confrontation by early 49 BC. The Consuls for the year, [[Gaius Claudius Marcellus Maior]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus]], were firm Optimates opposed to Caesar.<ref>Caesar, [http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/gallic.8.8.html#847 ''B.G.'' 8.50]</ref> Pompey, though remaining in Rome, was then serving as the governor of [[Roman Spain|Spain]] and commanded several legions. Upon assuming office in January, Antony immediately summoned a meeting of the Senate to resolve the conflict: he proposed both Caesar and Pompey lay down their commands and return to the status of mere [[privatus|private citizens]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 6</ref> His proposal was well received by most of the senators but the Consuls and Cato vehemently opposed it. Antony then made a new proposal: Caesar would retain only two of his eight legions and the governorship of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyrium]] if he was allowed to stand for the Consulship ''in absentia''. This arrangement ensured his [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from [[suit (law)|suit]] would continue: he had needed the Consulship to protect himself from prosecution by Pompey. Though Pompey found the concession satisfactory, Cato and Lentulus refused to back down, with Lentulus even expelling Antony from the Senate meeting by force. Antony fled Rome, fearing for his life, and returned to Caesar's camp on the banks of the [[Rubicon|Rubicon River]], the southern limit of Caesar's lawful command.\n\nWithin days of Antony's expulsion, on 7 January 49 BC, the Senate reconvened. Under the leadership of Cato and with the tacit support of Pompey, the Senate passed the \"final decree\" (''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'') stripping Caesar of his command and ordering him to return to Rome and stand trial for [[war crimes]]. The Senate further declared Caesar a [[traitor]] and a [[public enemy]] if he did not immediately disband his army.<ref>Caesar, [http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/civil.1.1.html#149 ''B.C.'' i.5]</ref> With all hopes of finding a peaceful solution gone after Antony's expulsion, Caesar used Antony as a pretext for marching on Rome. As Tribune, Antony's person was [[sacrosanct]] and therefore it was unlawful to harm him or refuse to recognize his veto. Three days later, on 10 January, Caesar [[Crossing the Rubicon|crossed the Rubicon River]], starting a [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Pompey'', 56.4</ref>  During the southern march, Caesar placed Antony as his second in command.\n\nCaesar's rapid advance surprised Pompey, who, along with the other chief members of the Optimates, fled Italy for Greece. After entering Rome, instead of pursuing Pompey, Caesar marched to [[Hispania|Spain]] to defeat Pompeian-loyalists there. Meanwhile, Antony, with the rank of [[Propraetor]] despite never having served as [[Praetor]], was installed as governor of Italy and commander of the army, stationed there while [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], one of Caesar's staff officers, ran the provisional administration of Rome itself.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 786</ref><ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 39\u201340</ref> Though Antony was well liked by his soldiers, most other citizens despised him for his lack of interest in the hardships they faced from the civil war.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 8</ref>\n\nBy the end of the year 49 BC, Caesar, already the ruler of Gaul, had captured Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia out of Optimates control. In early 48 BC, he prepared to sail with seven legions to Greece to face Pompey. Caesar had entrusted the defense of Illyricum to [[Gaius Antonius]], Antony's younger brother, and [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]]. Pompey's forces, however, defeated them and assumed control of the [[Adriatic Sea]] along with it. Additionally, the two legions they commanded defected to Pompey. Without their fleet, Caesar lacked the necessary transport ships to cross into Greece with his seven legions. Instead, he sailed with only two and placed Antony in command of the remaining five at [[Brundisium]] with instructions to join him as soon as he was able. In early 48 BC, [[Lucius Scribonius Libo (consul 34 BC)|Lucius Scribonius Libo]] was given command of Pompey's fleet, comprising some fifty galleys.<ref name=\"Broughton, pg. 281\">Broughton, p. 281</ref><ref>Holmes, p. 127</ref> Moving off to Brundisium, he blockaded Antony. Antony, however, managed to trick Libo into pursuing some decoy ships, causing Libo's squadron to be trapped and attacked. Most of Libo's fleet managed to escape, but several of his troops were trapped and captured.<ref name=\"Broughton, pg. 281\"/><ref>Holmes, p. 128</ref> With Libo gone, Antony joined Caesar in Greece by March 48 BC.\n\n[[File:Battle of Pharsalus, 48 BC.gif|thumb|left|350px|The [[Battle of Pharsalus]]: the decisive battle of Caesar's Civil War. Antony commanded the left wing of Caesar's army.]]\nDuring the Greek campaign, Plutarch records Antony was Caesar's top general and second to only him in reputation.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 10\">Plutarch, ''Antony'', 10</ref> Antony joined Caesar at the western [[Balkan Peninsula]] and [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|besieged Pompey's larger army]] at [[Dyrrhachium]]. With food sources running low, Caesar, in July, ordered a nocturnal assault on Pompey's camp, but Pompey's larger forces pushed back the assault. Though an indecisive result, the victory was a tactical win for Pompey. Pompey, however, did not order a counter-assault on Caesar's camp, allowing Caesar to retreat unhindered. Caesar would later remark the civil war would have ended that day if Pompey had only attacked him.<ref>Plutarch, ''Pompey'', 65</ref> Caesar managed to retreat to [[Thessaly]], with Pompey in pursuit.\n\nAssuming a defensive position at the plain of [[Pharsalus]], Caesar's army prepared for pitched battle with Pompey's, which outnumbered his own two to one. At the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] on 9 August 48 BC, Caesar commanded the right wing opposite Pompey while Antony commanded the left, indicating Antony's status as Caesar's top general.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 10\"/> The resulting battle was a decisive victory for Caesar. Though the civil war had not ended at Pharsulus, the battle marked the pinnacle of Caesar's power and effectively ended the Republic.<ref>Davis, 1999, p. 59</ref> The battle gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy, as prior to the battle much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and the Optimates as the legitimate government of Rome. After Pompey's defeat, most of the Senate defected to Caesar, including many of the soldiers who had fought under Pompey. Pompey himself fled to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], but Pharaoh [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator]] feared retribution from Caesar and had Pompey assassinated upon his arrival.\n\n====Governor of Italy====\n[[File:CdM, marcantonio raffigurato come alessandro, sardonice, 40 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|A [[Cameo (carving)|cameo carving]] of Mark Antony depicted as [[Alexander the Great]], c. 40 BC]]\n\nInstead of immediately pursuing Pompey and the remaining Optimates, Caesar returned to Rome and was appointed [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] with Antony as his [[Master of the Horse]] and second in command.<ref name=Plu37>Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#37 37.2]</ref> Caesar presided over his own election to a second Consulship for 47 BC and then, after eleven days in office, resigned this dictatorship.<ref>Jehne, 1987, pp. 15\u201338</ref> Caesar then sailed to Egypt, where he deposed Ptolemy XIII in favor of his sister [[Cleopatra]] in 47 BC. The young Cleopatra became Caesar's mistress and bore him a son, [[Caesarion]]. Caesar's actions further strengthened Roman control over the already Roman-dominated kingdom.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\nWhile Caesar was away in Egypt, Antony remained in Rome to govern Italy and restore order.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 796 and 798\">Hinard, 2000, pp. 796, 798</ref> Without Caesar to guide him, however, Antony quickly faced political difficulties and proved himself unpopular. The chief cause of his political challenges concerned [[debt forgiveness]]. One of the Tribunes for 47 BC, [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]], a former general under Pompey, proposed a law which would have canceled all outstanding debts. Antony opposed the law for political and personal reasons: he believed Caesar would not support such massive relief and suspected Dolabella had seduced his wife Antonia Hybrida Minor. When Dolabella sought to enact the law by force and seized the [[Roman Forum]],\nAntony responded by unleashing his soldiers upon the assembled masses.<ref>Plutarch: ''Antony'', c. 9, in ''Plutarch, Roman Lives'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-282502-5}}</ref> The resulting instability, especially among Caesar's veterans who would have benefited from the law, forced Caesar to return to Italy by October 47 BC.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 796 and 798\"/>\n\nAntony's handling of the affair with Dolabella caused a cooling of his relationship with Caesar. Antony's violent reaction had caused Rome to fall into a state of [[anarchy]]. Caesar sought to mend relations with the populist leader; he was elected to a third term as Consul for 46 BC, but proposed the Senate should transfer the consulship to Dolabella. When Antony protested, Caesar was forced to withdraw the motion out of shame. Later, Caesar sought to exercise his prerogatives as Dictator and directly proclaim Dolabella as Consul instead.<ref>Dio 43.51.8.</ref> Antony again protested and, in his capacity as an Augur, declared the omens were unfavorable and Caesar again backed down.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 11.3, less clear from Dio.</ref> Seeing the expediency of removing Dolabella from [[Rome]], Caesar ultimately pardoned him for his role in the riots and took him as one of his generals in his campaigns against the remaining Optimates resistance.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 10\"/> Antony, however, was stripped of all official positions and received no appointments for the year 46 BC or 45 BC. Instead of Antony, Caesar appointed [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] to be his Consular colleague for 46 BC. While Caesar campaigned in [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]], Antony remained in Rome as a mere [[privatus|private citizen]]. After returning victorious from North Africa, Caesar was appointed [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] for ten years and brought Cleopatra and their son to Rome. Antony again remained in Rome while Caesar, in 45 BC, sailed to Spain to defeat the final opposition to his rule. When Caesar returned in late 45 BC, the civil war was over.\n\nDuring this time Antony married his third wife, [[Fulvia]]. Following the scandal with Dolabella, Antony had divorced his second wife and quickly married Fulvia. Fulvia had previously been married to both [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] and [[Gaius Scribonius Curio (praetor 49 BC)|Gaius Scribonius Curio]], having been a widow since Curio's death in the [[Battle of the Bagradas (49 BC)|battle of the Bagradas]] in 49 BC. Though Antony and Fulvia were formally married in 47 BC, Cicero suggests the two had been in a relationship since at least 58 BC.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D48 Cicero.Phil.2.48.]</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D99 Cicero.Phil.2.99.]</ref> The union produced two children: [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]] (born 47) and [[Iullus Antonius]] (born 45)\n\n===Assassination of Caesar===\n{{main|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}\n\n==== Ides of March====\nWhatever conflicts existed between himself and Caesar, Antony remained faithful to Caesar, ensuring their estrangement did not last long. Antony reunited with Caesar at [[Narbo]] in 45 BC with full reconciliation coming in 44 BC when Antony was elected Consul alongside Caesar. Caesar planned a new [[Roman-Parthian Wars|invasion of Parthia]] and desired to leave Antony in Italy to govern Rome in his name. The reconciliation came soon after Antony rejected an offer by [[Trebonius|Gaius Trebonius]], one of Caesar's generals, to join a conspiracy to assassinate Caesar.<ref>Broughton, p. 299</ref><ref>Bringmann, p. 272</ref>\n\n[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|The \"Death of Julius Caesar\", as depicted by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]].

The festival was held in honor of [[Lupa Capitolina|Lupa]], the she-wolf who suckled the infant orphans [[Romulus and Remus]], the founders of Rome.<ref>[http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkTwo.htm#_Toc69367692 Ovid, ''Fasti'': Lupercalia]</ref> The political atmosphere of Rome at the time of the festival was deeply divided. Caesar had enacted a number of [[Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar|constitutional reforms]] which centralized effectively all political powers within his own hands. He was granted further honors, including a form of semi-official [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]], with Antony as his high priest.<ref>Fuller, Chapter 13</ref> Additionally, the day before the festival, Caesar had been named [[Roman dictator|Dictator for Life]], effectively granting unlimited power. Caesar's political rivals feared these reforms were his attempts at transforming the Republic into an open monarchy. During the festival's activities, Antony publicly offered Caesar a [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], which Caesar refused. The event presented a powerful message: a diadem was a symbol of a king. By refusing it, Caesar demonstrated he had no intention of making himself King of Rome. Antony's motive for such actions is not clear and it is unknown if he acted with Caesar's prior approval or on his own.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 12</ref>\n[[File:Marc Antony's Oration at Caesar's Funeral by George Edward Robertson.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|\"Marc Antony's Oration at Caesar's Funeral\" as depicted by George Edward Robertson]]\n\nA group of Senators resolved to kill Caesar to prevent him from seizing the throne.

Although Cassius was \"the moving spirit\" in the plot, winning over the chief assassins to the cause of [[tyrannicide]], Brutus, with his family's history of deposing Rome's kings, became their leader.<ref>Broughton, p. 320</ref> [[Cicero]], though not personally involved in the conspiracy, later claimed Antony's actions sealed Caesar's fate as such an obvious display of Caesar's preeminence motivated them to act.<ref>Cicero, ''2nd Philippic'', 34</ref> Originally, the conspirators had planned to eliminate not only Caesar but also many of his supporters, including Antony, but Brutus rejected the proposal, limiting the conspiracy to Caesar alone.<ref>[[Velleius Paterculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#58 2.58.5]; [[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#18 18.2\u20136].</ref> With Caesar preparing to depart for [[Parthia]] in late March, the conspirators prepared to act when Caesar appeared for the Senate meeting on the [[Ides of March]] (15 March).\n\nAntony was supposed to attend with Caesar, but was waylaid at the door by one of the plotters and prevented from intervening. According to the Greek historian [[Plutarch]], as Caesar arrived at the Senate, [[Tillius Cimber|Lucius Tillius Cimber]] presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/m_brutus.html Plutarch \u2013 Life of Brutus]</ref> The other conspirators crowded round to offer their support. Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenseless on the lower steps of the portico. According to Roman historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], around 60 or more men participated in the assassination. Caesar was stabbed 23 times and died from the blood loss attributable to multiple stab wounds.<ref>Woolf</ref><ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'', c. 82.</ref>\n\n====Leader of the Caesarian Party====\nIn the turmoil surrounding the assassination, Antony escaped Rome dressed as a slave, fearing Caesar's death would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters. When this did not occur, he soon returned to Rome. The conspirators, who styled themselves the ''[[Liberatores]]'' (\"The Liberators\"), had barricaded themselves on the [[Capitoline Hill]] for their own safety. Though they believed Caesar's death would restore the Republic, Caesar had been immensely popular with the [[Plebeians|Roman middle and lower classes]], who became enraged upon learning a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion.\n\nAntony, as the sole Consul, soon took the initiative and seized the state treasury. [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]], Caesar's widow, presented him with Caesar's personal papers and custody of his extensive property, clearly marking him as Caesar's heir and leader of the Caesarian faction.<ref>David, 2000, p. 246</ref> Caesar's [[Magister Equitum|Master of the Horse]] [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] marched over 6,000 troops into Rome on 16 March to restore order and to act as the bodyguards of the Caesarian faction. Lepidus wanted to storm the Capitol, but Antony preferred a peaceful solution as a majority of both the Liberators and Caesar's own supporters preferred a settlement over civil war.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, p. 64</ref> On 17 March, at Antony's arrangement, the Senate met to discuss a compromise, which, due to the presence of Caesar's veterans in the city, was quickly reached. Caesar's assassins would be pardoned of their crimes and, in return, all of Caesar's actions would be ratified.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 14</ref> In particular, the offices assigned to both Brutus and Cassius by Caesar were likewise ratified. Antony also agreed to accept the appointment of his rival Dolabella as his Consular colleague to replace Caesar.<ref>Bramstedt, 2004, p. 143</ref> Having neither troops, money, nor popular support, the Liberatores were forced to accept Antony's proposal. This compromise was a great success for Antony, who managed to simultaneously appease Caesar's veterans, reconcile the Senate majority, and appear to the Liberatores as their partner and protector.<ref>Hinard, 2000, 827</ref>\n\n[[File:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Augustus|Octavian]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s adopted son. Antony would struggle with Octavian for leadership of the Caesarian party following Caesar's assassination.]]\nOn 19 March, Caesar's will was opened and read. In it, Caesar posthumously adopted his great-nephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] and named him his principal heir. Then only 19 years old and stationed with Caesar's army in Macedonia, the youth became a member of Caesar's [[Julia (gens)|Julian clan]], changing his name to \"Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus\" (Octavian) in accordance with the conventions of [[Roman adoption]]. Though not the chief beneficiary, Antony did receive some bequests.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 832</ref>\n\nShortly after the compromise was reached, as a sign of good faith, Brutus, against the advice of Cassius and Cicero, agreed Caesar would be given a public funeral and his will would be validated. Caesar's funeral was held on 20 March. Antony, as Caesar's faithful lieutenant and reigning Consul, was chosen to preside over the ceremony and to recite the [[elegy]]. During the [[demagogue|demagogic]] speech, he enumerated the deeds of Caesar and, publicly reading his will, detailed the donations Caesar had left to the Roman people. Antony then seized the blood-stained [[toga]] from Caesar's body and presented it to the crowd. Worked into a fury by the bloody spectacle, the assembly [[rioted]]. Several buildings in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and some houses of the conspirators were burned to the ground. Panicked, many of the conspirators fled Italy.<ref>Eck (2003), p. 10</ref> Under the pretext of not being able to guarantee their safety, Antony relieved Brutus and Cassius of their judicial duties in Rome and instead assigned them responsibility for procuring wheat for Rome from Sicily and Asia. Such an assignment, in addition to being unworthy of their rank, would have kept them far from Rome and shifted the balance towards Antony. Refusing such secondary duties, the two traveled to Greece instead. Additionally, Cleopatra left Rome to return to Egypt.\n\nDespite the provisions of Caesar's will, Antony proceeded to act as leader of the Caesarian faction, including appropriating for himself a portion of Caesar's fortune rightfully belonging to Octavian. Antony enacted the [[Lex Antonia]], which formally abolished the Dictatorship, in an attempt to consolidate his power by gaining the support of the Senatorial class. He also enacted a number of laws he claimed to have found in Caesar's papers to ensure his popularity with Caesar's veterans, particularly by providing [[land grants]] to them. Lepidus, with Antony's support, was named [[Pontifex Maximus]] to succeed Caesar. To solidify the alliance between Antony and Lepidus, Antony's daughter [[Antonia (daughter of Mark Antony)|Antonia Prima]] was engaged to Lepidus's son, also named [[Lepidus the Younger|Lepidus]]. Surrounding himself with a bodyguard of over six thousand of Caesar's veterans, Antony presented himself as Caesar's true successor, largely ignoring Octavian.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 248</ref>\n\n====First conflict with Octavian====\nOctavian arrived in Rome in May to claim his inheritance. Although Antony had amassed political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the Caesarian faction. The Senatorial Republicans increasingly viewed Antony as a new tyrant. Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 11.</ref> When Antony refused to relinquish Caesar's vast fortune to him, Octavian borrowed heavily to fulfill the bequests in Caesar's will to the Roman people and to his veterans, as well as to establish his own bodyguard of veterans.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Romans From Village to Empire|last = Boatwright|first = Mary|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199730575|location = New York|pages = 272\u201373}}</ref> This earned him the support of Caesarian sympathizers who hoped to use him as a means of eliminating Antony.<ref>Syme, 1939, pp. 114\u201320.</ref> The Senate, and Cicero in particular, viewed Antony as the greater danger of the two. By summer 44 BC, Antony was in a difficult position due to his actions regarding his compromise with the Liberatores following Caesar's assassination. He could either denounce the Liberatores as murderers and alienate the Senate or he could maintain his support for the compromise and risk betraying the legacy of Caesar, strengthening Octavian's position. In either case, his situation as ruler of Rome would be weakened. Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]] later recorded that while Antony, as reigning Consul, maintained the advantage in the relationship, the general affection of the Roman people was shifting to Octavian due to his status as Caesar's son.<ref>Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', XLV, 11</ref><ref>Bleicken, 1998, p. 58</ref>\n\n[[File:MarcusAntoniusCVibiusVarus.jpg|thumb|A [[denarius]] of Marcus Antonius struck in 42 BC]]\nSupporting the Senatorial faction against Antony, Octavian, in September 44 BC, encouraged the leading Senator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] to attack Antony in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]] portraying him as a threat to the Republican order.<ref>Chisholm, 1981, p. 26.</ref><ref>Rowell, 1962, p. 30</ref> Risk of civil war between Antony and Octavian grew. Octavian continued to recruit Caesar's veterans to his side, away from Antony, with two of Antony's legions defecting in November 44 BC. At that time, Octavian, only a [[privatus|private citizen]], lacked legal authority to command the Republic's armies, making his command illegal. With popular opinion in Rome turning against him and his Consular term nearing its end, Antony attempted to secure a favorable military assignment to secure an army to protect himself. The Senate, as was custom, assigned Antony and Dolabella the provinces of [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Roman Syria|Syria]], respectively, to govern in 43 BC after their Consular terms expired. Antony, however, objected to the assignment, preferring to govern [[Cisalpine Gaul]] which had been assigned to [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], one of Caesar's assassins.<ref>Eck 2003, pp. 11\u201312.</ref><ref>Rowell, 1962, p. 21</ref> When Decimus refused to surrender his province, Antony marched north in December 44 BC with his remaining soldiers to take the province by force, besieging Decimus at [[Mutina]].<ref>Rowell, 1962, p. 24</ref> The Senate, led by a fiery Cicero, denounced Antony's actions and declared him an [[outlaw]].\n\nRatifying Octavian's extraordinary command on 1 January 43 BC, the Senate dispatched him along with Consuls [[Aulus Hirtius|Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]] to defeat Antony and his five legions.<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 12</ref><ref>Syme, 1939, p. 167</ref> Antony's forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Mutina]] in April 43 BC, forcing Antony to retreat to [[Transalpine Gaul]].

[[Sextus Pompey]], son of Caesar's old rival [[Pompey|Pompey Magnus]], was given command of the Republic's fleet from his base in Sicily while Brutus and Cassius were granted the governorships of [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Roman Syria|Syria]] respectively. These appointments attempted to renew the \"Republican\" cause.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 838</ref> However, the eight legions serving under Octavian, composed largely of Caesar's veterans, refused to follow one of Caesar's murderers, allowing Octavian to retain his command. Meanwhile, Antony recovered his position by joining forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been assigned the governorship of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Transalpine Gaul]] and [[Hispania Citerior|Nearer Spain]].<ref>Syme, 1939, pp. 176\u201386.</ref> Antony sent Lepidus to Rome to broker a conciliation. Though he was an ardent Caesarian, Lepidus had maintained friendly relations with the Senate and with Sextus Pompey. His legions, however, quickly joined Antony, giving him control over seventeen legions, the largest army in the West.<ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 839\u201340</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman-Empire-43BC.png|thumb|450px|Map of the [[Roman Republic]] in 43 BC after the establishment of the [[Second Triumvirate]]: {{colbegin|colwidth=200px}}\n{{legend|#81EE5B|Antony}}{{legend|#C19666|Lepidus}}{{legend|#DE8DE0|Octavian}}{{legend|#FF925E|Triumvirs collectively}}\n{{legend|#7D87FF|Sextus Pompey}}{{legend|#ED1C24|The Liberators}}{{legend|#FED250|Rome's client kingdoms}}{{legend|#FF8C8C|Ptolemaic Egypt}}{{colend}}]]\n\nBy mid-May, Octavian began secret negotiations to form an alliance with Antony to provide a united Caesarian party against the Liberators. Remaining in Cisalpine Gaul, Octavian dispatched emissaries to Rome in July 43 BC demanding he be appointed Consul to replace Hirtius and Pansa and that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy be rescinded.<ref>Rowell, 1962, pp. 26\u201327</ref> When the Senate refused, Octavian marched on Rome with his eight legions and assumed control of the city in August 43 BC. Octavian proclaimed himself Consul, rewarded his soldiers, and then set about prosecuting Caesar's murderers. By the [[Quintus Pedius|lex Pedia]], all of the conspirators and Sextus Pompey were convicted \u2033in absentia\u2033 and declared public enemies. Then, at the instigation of Lepidus, Octavian went to Cisalpine Gaul to meet Antony.\n\nIn November 43 BC, Octavian, Lepidus, and Antony met near [[Bologna|Bononia]].<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 15</ref> After two days of discussions, the group agreed to establish a [[Second Triumvirate|three man dictatorship]] to govern the Republic for five years, known as the \"Three Men for the Restoration of the Republic\" (Latin: \"Triumviri Rei publicae Constituendae\"), known to modern historians as the Second Triumvirate. They shared military command of the Republic's armies and provinces among themselves: Antony received Gaul, Lepidus Spain, and Octavian (as the junior partner) Africa. They jointly governed Italy. The Triumvirate would have to conquer the rest of Rome's holdings; Brutus and Cassius held the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], and Sextus Pompey held the Mediterranean islands.<ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 841\u201342</ref> On 27 November 43 BC, the Triumvirate was formally established by a new law, the [[lex Titia]]. Octavian and Antony reinforced their alliance through Octavian's marriage to Antony's stepdaughter, [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]].\n[[File:Fulvia y Marco Antonio, o La venganza de Fulvia (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|The vengeance of Fulvia by Francisco Maura Y Montaner, 1888, depicting Fulvia, Antony's wife, inspecting the severed head of Cicero]]\nThe primary objective of the Triumvirate was to avenge Caesar's death and to make war upon his murderers. Before marching against Brutus and Cassius in the East, the Triumvirs issued [[proscription]]s against their enemies in Rome. The Dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] had taken similar action to purge Rome of his opponents in 82 BC. The proscribed were named on public lists, stripped of citizenship, and outlawed. Their wealth and property were confiscated by the state, and rewards were offered to anyone who secured their arrest or death. With such encouragements, the proscription produced deadly results; two thousand [[Roman aristocracy|Roman knights]] were executed, and one third of the Senate, among them [[Cicero]], who was executed on 7 December. The confiscations helped replenish the [[Aerarium|State Treasury]], which had been depleted by Caesar's civil war the decade before; when this seemed insufficient to fund the imminent war against Brutus and Cassius, the Triumvirs imposed new taxes, especially on the wealthy. By January 42 BC the proscription had ended; it had lasted two months, and though less bloody than Sulla's, it traumatized Roman society. A number of those named and outlawed had fled to either Sextus Pompey in Sicily or to the Liberators in the East.<ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 846\u201347</ref> Senators who swore loyalty to the Triumvirate were allowed to keep their positions; on 1 January 42 BC, the senate officially deified Caesar as \"[[Divus Julius|The Divine Julius]]\", and confirmed Antony's position as his high priest.\n\n====War against the Liberators====\n{{main|Liberators' civil war|Battle of Philippi}}\n\nDue to the infighting within the Triumvirate during 43 BC, Brutus and Cassius had assumed control of much of Rome's eastern territories, and amassed a large army. Before the Triumvirate could cross the [[Adriatic Sea]] into Greece where the Liberators had stationed their army, the Triumvirate had to address the threat posed by Sextus Pompey and his fleet. From his base in Sicily, Sextus raided the Italian coast and blockaded the Triumvirs. Octavian's friend and admiral [[Quintus Salvidienus Rufus]] thwarted an attack by Sextus against the southern Italian mainland at [[Rhegium]], but Salvidienus was then defeated in the resulting naval battle because of the inexperience of his crews. Only when Antony arrived with his fleet was the blockade broken. Though the blockade was defeated, control of Sicily remained in Sextus's hand, but the defeat of the Liberators was the Triumvirate's first priority.\n\n[[File:Phil2.png|300px|thumb|right|First Battle of Philippi \u2013 3 October 42 BC]]\n[[File:Phil3.png|300px|thumb|right|Second Battle of Philippi \u2013 23 October 42 BC]]\nIn the summer of 42 BC, Octavian and Antony sailed for Macedonia to face the Liberators with nineteen legions, the vast majority of their army<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 14, CVIII</ref> (approximately 100,000 regular infantry plus supporting cavalry and irregular auxiliary units), leaving Rome under the administration of Lepidus. Likewise, the army of the Liberators also commanded an army of nineteen legions; their legions, however, were not at full strength while the legions of Antony and Octavian were.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While the Triumvirs commanded a larger number of infantry, the Liberators commanded a larger cavalry contingent.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 850</ref> The Liberators, who controlled Macedonia, did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the Triumvirs' communications with their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest and had gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the Eastern provinces and levies from Rome's client kingdoms.\n\nBrutus and Cassius held a position on the high ground along both sides of the [[via Egnatia]] west of the city of [[Philippi]]. The south position was anchored to a supposedly impassable marsh, while the north was bordered by impervious hills. They had plenty of time to fortify their position with a rampart and a ditch. Brutus put his camp on the north while Cassius occupied the south of the via Egnatia. Antony arrived shortly and positioned his army on the south of the via Egnatia, while Octavian put his legions north of the road. Antony offered battle several times, but the Liberators were not lured to leave their defensive stand. Thus, Antony tried to secretly outflank the Liberators' position through the marshes in the south. This provoked a pitched battle on 3 October 42 BC. Antony commanded the Triumvirate's army due to Octavian's sickness on the day, with Antony directly controlling the right flank opposite Cassius. Because of his health, Octavian remained in camp while his lieutenants assumed a position on the left flank opposite Brutus. In the resulting first battle of Philippi, Antony defeated Cassius and captured his camp while Brutus overran Octavian's troops and penetrated into the Triumvirs' camp but was unable to capture the sick Octavian. The battle was a tactical draw but due to poor communications Cassius believed the battle was a complete defeat and committed suicide to prevent being captured.\n\nBrutus assumed sole command of the Liberator army and preferred a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] over open conflict. His officers, however, were dissatisfied with these defensive tactics and his Caesarian veterans threatened to defect, forcing Brutus to give battle at the second battle of Philippi on 23 October. While the battle was initially evenly matched, Antony's leadership routed Brutus's forces. Brutus committed suicide the day after the defeat and the remainder of his army swore allegiance to the Triumvirate. Over fifty thousand Romans died in the two battles. While Antony treated the losers mildly, Octavian dealt cruelly with his prisoners and even beheaded Brutus's corpse.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 144\u201353</ref><ref>Hindard, 2000, pp. 850\u201351</ref><ref>Cosme, 2009, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nThe battles of Philippi ended the civil war in favor of the Caesarian faction. With the defeat of the Liberators, only Sextus Pompey and his fleet remained to challenge the Triumvirate's control over the Republic.\n\n==Master of the Roman East==\n\n===Division of the Republic===\n[[File:Roman-Empire-42BC.png|thumb|450px|Map of the [[Roman Republic]] in 42 BC after the [[Battle of Philippi]]: {{colbegin|colwidth=200px}}\n{{legend|#81EE5B|Antony}}{{legend|#C19666|Lepidus}}{{legend|#DE8DE0|Octavian}}{{legend|#FF925E|Triumvirs collectively}}\n{{legend|#7D87FF|Sextus Pompey}}{{legend|#ED1C24|Parthian Empire}}{{legend|#FED250|Rome's client kingdoms}}{{legend|#FF8C8C|Ptolemaic Egypt}}{{colend}}]]\n\nThe victory at Philippi left the members of the Triumvirate as masters of the Republic, save [[Sextus Pompey]] in Sicily. Upon returning to Rome, the Triumvirate repartitioned rule of Rome's provinces among themselves, with Antony as the clear senior partner. He received the largest distribution, governing all of the Eastern provinces while retaining [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in the West. Octavian's position improved, as he received Spain, which was taken from Lepidus. Lepidus was then reduced to holding only Africa, and he assumed a clearly tertiary role in the Triumvirate. Rule over Italy remained undivided, but Octavian was assigned the difficult and unpopular task of demobilizing their veterans and providing them with land distributions in Italy.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 854</ref><ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 253</ref> Antony assumed direct control of the East while he installed one of his lieutenants as the ruler of Gaul. During his absence, several of his supporters held key positions in Rome to protect his interests there.\n\nThe East was in need of reorganization after the rule of the Liberators in the previous years. In addition, Rome contended with the [[Parthian Empire]] for dominance of the [[Near East]]. The Parthian threat to the Triumvirate's rule was urgent due to the fact that the Parthians supported the Liberators in the recent civil war, aid which included the supply troops at Philippi.<ref>Bivar, 1968, pp. 56\u201357</ref> As ruler of the East, Antony also assumed responsibility for overseeing Caesar's planned invasion of Parthia to avenge the defeat of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC.\n\nIn 42 BC, the Roman East was composed of several directly controlled provinces and [[Client state|client kingdoms]]. The provinces included [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia]], [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]], [[Roman Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], and [[Creta et Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]]. Approximately half of the eastern territory was controlled by Rome's client kingdoms, nominally independent kingdoms subject to Roman direction. These kingdoms included:\n* [[Odrysian Kingdom|Odrysian Thrace]] in [[Eastern Europe]]\n* The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] along the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]]\n* [[Galatia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Artaxiad dynasty|Armenia]], and several smaller kingdoms in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]\n* [[Hasmonean dynasty|Judea]], [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]], and the [[Nabataean kingdom]] in the [[Middle East]]\n* [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] in Africa\n\n===Activities in the East===\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra VII|Reign of Cleopatra VII}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = -0035 Altes Museum Portrait Kleopatra VII anagoria.JPG\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cleopatra VII, Marble, 40-30 BC, Vatican Museums 001.jpg\n| width2 = 220\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left image: [[Cleopatra VII]] bust in the [[Altes Museum]], [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], Roman artwork, 1st century BC<br>Right: bust of Cleopatra VII, dated 40\u201330 BC, [[Vatican Museums]], showing her with a 'melon' hairstyle and [[Hellenistic]] royal [[diadem]] worn over her head\n}}\n\nAntony spent the winter of 42 BC in [[Athens]], where he ruled generously towards the Greek cities. A proclaimed ''[[philhellene]]'' (\"Friend of all things Greek\"), Antony supported Greek culture to win the loyalty of the inhabitants of the Greek East. He attended religious festivals and ceremonies, including initiation into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]],<ref>Hinard 2000, p. 854</ref> a secret cult dedicated to the worship of the goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]. Beginning in 41 BC, he traveled across the [[Aegean Sea]] to [[Anatolia]], leaving his friend [[Lucius Marcius Censorinus (consul 39 BC)|Lucius Marcius Censorius]] as governor of [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Upon his arrival in [[Ephesus]] in Asia, Antony was worshiped as the god [[Dionysus]] born anew.<ref>Lepelley, 1998, p. 435</ref> He demanded heavy taxes from the Hellenic cities in return for his pro-Greek culture policies, but exempted those cities which had remained loyal to Caesar during the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] and compensated those cities which had suffered under [[Liberators' civil war|Caesar's assassins]], including [[Rhodes]], [[Lycia et Pamphylia|Lycia]], and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. He granted pardons to all Roman nobles living in the East who had supported the [[Optimate]] cause, except for Caesar's assassins.\n\nRuling from Ephesus, Antony consolidated Rome's hegemony in the East, receiving envoys from Rome's client kingdoms and intervening in their dynastic affairs, extracting enormous financial \"gifts\" from them in the process. Though King [[Deiotarus]] of [[Galatia]] supported Brutus and Cassius following Caesar's assassination, Antony allowed him to retain his position. He also confirmed [[Ariarathes X of Cappadocia|Ariarathes X]] as king of [[Cappadocia]] after the execution of his brother [[Ariobarzanes III of Cappadocia]] by Cassius before the [[Battle of Philippi]]. In [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]], several Jewish delegations complained to Antony of the harsh rule of [[Phasael]] and [[Herod the Great|Herod]], the sons of Rome's assassinated chief Jewish minister [[Antipater the Idumaean]]. After Herod offered him a large financial gift, Antony confirmed the brothers in their positions.  Subsequently, influenced by the beauty and charms of [[Glaphyra (hetaera)|Glaphyra]], the widow of [[Archelaus (father of Archelaus of Cappadocia)|Archela\u00fcs]] (formerly the high priest of [[Comana (Cappadocia)|Comana]]), Antony deposed Ariarathes, and appointed Glaphyra's son, [[Archelaus of Cappadocia|Archela\u00fcs]], to rule Cappadocia.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'', 49.32; [[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 5.7; ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgre01smituoft#page/262/mode/2up vol.

Antony had first met a young Cleopatra while campaigning in Egypt in 55 BC and again in 48 BC when Caesar had backed her as queen of Egypt over the claims of her half-sister [[Arsinoe IV of Egypt|Arsinoe]]. Cleopatra would bear Caesar a son, [[Caesarion]], in 47 BC and the two living in Rome as Caesar's guests until his assassination in 44 BC. After Caesar's assassination, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt, where she named the child as her co-ruler. In 42 BC, the Triumvirate, in recognition for Cleopatra's help towards [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] in opposition to the Liberators, granted official recognition to Caesarion's position as king of Egypt. Arriving in Tarsus aboard her magnificent ship, Cleopatra invited Antony to a grand banquet to solidify their alliance. {{#tag:ref |Ancient writers (e.g. Appian, ''Civil Wars'' 5.8.1) place the beginning of their famous romance at this meeting with Antony totally surrendering to Cleopatra's beauty but modern historians reject this notion as retrospective historical propaganda on the part of [[Augustus]].|group=\"note\"}} As the most powerful of Rome's eastern vassals, Egypt was indispensable in Rome's planned military invasion of the [[Parthian Empire]]. At Cleopatra's request, Antony ordered the execution of Arsinoe, who, though marched in Caesar's [[Roman triumph|triumphal parade]] in 46 BC,<ref>Dio, 43.19.2\u20133; Appian, 2.101.420</ref> had been granted sanctuary at the [[temple of Artemis]] in Ephesus. Antony and Cleopatra then spent the winter of 41 BC together in [[Alexandria]]. Cleopatra bore Antony twin children, [[Alexander Helios]] and [[Cleopatra Selene II]], in 40 BC, and a third, Ptolemy Philadelphus, in 36 BC. Antony also granted formal control over Cyprus, which had been under Egyptian control since 47 BC during the turmoil of [[Caesar's civil war]], to Cleopatra in 40 BC as a gift for her loyalty to Rome.<ref>Mitford, pp. 1289\u201397.</ref>\n\nAntony, in his first months in the East, raised money, reorganized his troops, and secured the alliance of Rome's client kingdoms. He also promoted himself as Hellenistic ruler, which won him the affection of the Greek peoples of the East but also made him the target of Octavian's propaganda in Rome. According to some ancient authors, Antony led a carefree life of luxury in Alexandria.<ref>Plutarch, Antony, 28\u201330</ref><ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', l. 48.</ref> Upon learning the [[Parthian Empire]] had invaded Rome's territory in early 40 BC, Antony left Egypt for Syria to confront the invasion.

Additionally, tens of thousands of veterans who had fought for the Republican cause in the war also required land grants. This was necessary to ensure they would not support a political opponent of the Triumvirate.<ref>Eck, p. 18</ref> However, the Triumvirs did not possess sufficient state-controlled land to allot to the veterans. This left Octavian with two choices: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who might back a military rebellion against the Triumvirate's rule. Octavian chose the former.<ref>Eck, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> As many as eighteen Roman towns through Italy were affected by the confiscations of 41 BC, with entire populations driven out.<ref name=\"Eck, pg 19\">Eck, p. 19</ref>\n\nLed by [[Fulvia]], the wife of Antony, the Senators grew hostile towards Octavian over the issue of the land confiscations.

Tensions escalated into open war, however, when Octavian divorced [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], Fulvia's daughter from her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. Outraged, Fulvia, supported by Lucius, raised an army to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. According to the ancient historian [[Appian]], Fulvia's chief reason for the war was her jealousy of Antony's affairs with Cleopatra in Egypt and desire to draw Antony back to Rome.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0232%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D19 Appian.B.Civ.5.3.19.]</ref> Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian and Lepidus, however, as the Roman army still depended on the Triumvirs for their salaries.<ref name=\"Eck, pg 19\"/> Lucius and Fulvia, supported by their army, marched on Rome and promised the people an end to the Triumvirate in favor of Antony's sole rule.

While Octavian pardoned Lucius for his role in the war and even granted him command in Spain as his chief lieutenant there, Fulvia was forced to flee to Greece with her children. With the war over, Octavian was left in sole control over Italy. When Antony's governor of Gaul died, Octavian took over his legions there, further strengthening his control over the West.<ref>Southern, 2001, p. 78</ref>\n\nDespite the Parthian Empire's invasion of Rome's eastern territories, Fulvia's civil war forced Antony to leave the East and return to Rome in order to secure his position. Meeting her in Athens, Antony rebuked Fulvia for her actions before sailing on to Italy with his army to face Octavian, laying siege to [[Brundisium]]. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their shared service under Caesar. The legions under their command followed suit.<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 21.</ref><ref>Eder, 2005, p. 19</ref> Meanwhile, in [[Sicyon]], Fulvia died of a sudden and unknown illness.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0007%3Achapter%3D30%3Asection%3D3 Plutarch.Vit.Ant.30.3.]</ref> Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their soldiers allowed the triumvirs to effect a reconciliation through a new power sharing agreement in September 40 BC. The Roman world was redivided, with Antony receiving the Eastern provinces, Octavian the Western provinces, and Lepidus relegated to a clearly junior position as governor of Africa. This agreement, known as the ''Treaty of Brundisium'', reinforced the Triumvirate and allowed Antony to begin preparing for Caesar's long-awaited campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]]. As a symbol of their renewed alliance, Antony married [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]], Octavian's sister, in October 40 BC.\n\n===Antony's Parthian War===\n{{main|Antony's Parthian War}}\n\n====Roman\u2013Parthian relations====\n[[File:Parther reich.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the [[Parthian Empire]]. Parthia shared its western border along the [[Euphrates River]] with Rome.]]\n\nThe rise of the [[Parthian Empire]] in the 3rd century BC and Rome's expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean during the 2nd century BC brought the two powers into direct contact, causing centuries of tumultuous and strained relations. Though periods of peace developed cultural and commercial exchanges, war was a constant threat. Influence over the [[buffer state]] of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], located to the north-east of [[Roman Syria]], was often a central issue in the Roman-Parthian conflict. In 95 BC, Parthian [[Shah]] [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], installed [[Tigranes the Great]] as Parthian's client-king over Armenia. Tigranes would wage [[Mithridatic Wars|a series of three wars against Rome]] before being ultimately defeated by [[Pompey]] in 66 BC.<ref>Scullard, 1984, p. 106</ref> Thereafter, with his son [[Artavasdes II of Armenia|Artavasdes II]] in Rome as a hostage, Tigranes would rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55 BC.<ref>Fuller, 1965, p. 45</ref> Rome then installed Artavasdes II as king and continued its influence over Armenia.\n\nIn 53 BC, Rome's governor of Syria, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], led an expedition across the [[Euphrates]] River into Parthian territory to confront the Parthian Shah [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]]. Artavasdes II offered Crassus the aid of nearly forty thousand troops to assist his Parthian expedition on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia as the safer route.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus''. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html 19.1\u20133].</ref> Crassus refused, choosing instead the more direct route by crossing the Euphrates directly into desert Parthian territory. Crassus' actions proved disastrous as his army was defeated at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] by a numerically inferior Parthian force. Crassus' defeat forced Armenia to shift its loyalty to Parthia, with Artavasdes II's sister marrying Orodes' son and heir [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Crassus'' 19; 22; 33.</ref>\n\nIn early 44 BC, Julius Caesar announced his intentions to invade Parthia and restore Roman power in the East. His reasons were to punish the Parthians for assisting Pompey in the [[Caesar's Civil War|recent civil war]], to avenge Crassus' defeat at Carrhae, and especially to match the glory of [[Alexander the Great]] for himself.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 820</ref> Before Caesar could launch his campaign, however, he was assassinated. As part of the compromise between Antony and the Republicans to restore order following Caesar's murder, [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] was assigned the governorship of Syria and command over Caesar's planned Parthian campaign. The compromise did not hold, however, and the Republicans were forced to flee to the East. The Republicans directed [[Quintus Labienus]] to attract the Parthians to their side in the [[Liberators' civil war|resulting war against Antony and Octavian]]. After the Republicans were defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]], Labienus joined the Parthians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morello|first=Antonio|title=Titus Labienus et Cingulum, Quintus Labienus Parthicus Volume 9 of Nummus et historia|year=2005|publisher=Circolo numismatico Mario Rasile|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Titus_Labienus_et_Cingulum.html?id=Ipk_YgEACAAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Coins of Rome about Parthia: Quintus Labienus (42-39 B.C.)|url=http://www.parthia.com/labienus.htm|accessdate=5 February 2013}}</ref> Despite Rome's internal turmoil during the time, the Parthians did not immediately benefit from the [[power vacuum]] in the East due to Orodes II's reluctance despite Labienus' urgings to the contrary.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 857\">Hinard, 2000, p. 857</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 41 BC, Antony, to reassert Roman power in the East, conquered [[Palmyra]] on the Roman-Parthian border.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 857\"/> Antony then spent the winter of 41 BC in Alexandria with Cleopatra, leaving only two legions to defend the Syrian border against Parthian incursions.

Labienus, the Republican ally of Brutus and Cassius, accompanied him to advise him and to rally the former Republican soldiers stationed in Syria to the Parthian cause. Labienus recruited many of the former Republican soldiers to the Parthian campaign in opposition to Antony. The joint Parthian\u2013Roman force, after initial success in Syria, separated to lead their offensive in two directions: Pacorus marched south toward [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]] while Labienus crossed the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the north into [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]]. Labienus conquered southern [[Anatolia]] with little resistance. The Roman governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]], a partisan of Antony, was forced to flee his province, allowing Labienus to recruit the Roman soldiers stationed there. For his part, Pacorus advanced south to [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]]. In [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]], the exiled prince [[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]] allied himself with the Parthians. When his brother, Rome's client king [[Hyrcanus II]], refused to accept Parthian domination, he was deposed in favor of Antigonus as Parthia's client king in Judea. Pacorus' conquest had captured much of the Syrian and Palestinian interior, with much of the Phoenician coast occupied as well. The city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] remained the last major Roman outpost in the region.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 858\">Hinard, 2000, p. 858</ref>\n\nAntony, then in Egypt with Cleopatra, did not respond immediately to the Parthian invasion. Though he left Alexandria for Tyre in early 40 BC, when he learned of [[Perusine War|the civil war between his wife and Octavian]], he was forced to return to Italy with his army to secure his position in Rome rather than defeat the Parthians.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 858\"/> Instead, Antony dispatched [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] to check the Parthian advance. Arriving in the East in spring 39 BC, Ventidius surprised Labienus near the [[Taurus Mountains]], claiming victory at [[Battle of the Cilician Gates|the Cilician Gates]]. Ventidius ordered Labienus executed as a traitor and the formerly rebellious Roman soldiers under his command were reincorporated under Antony's control. He then met a Parthian army at the border between Cilicia and Syria, defeating it and killing a large portion of the Parthian soldiers at [[Battle of Amanus Pass|the Amanus Pass]]. Ventidius's actions temporarily halted the Parthian advance and restored Roman authority in the East, forcing Pacorus to abandon his conquests and return to Parthia.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 877</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 38 BC, the Parthians resumed their offensive with Pacorus leading an army across the Euphrates. Ventidius, in order to gain time, leaked [[disinformation]] to Pacorus implying that he should cross the Euphrates River at their usual ford. Pacorus did not trust this information and decided to cross the river much farther downstream; this was what Ventidius hoped would occur and gave him time to get his forces ready.<ref>Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', pp.  1239</ref> The Parthians faced no opposition and proceeded to the town of [[Gindarus]] in [[Cyrrhestica]] where Ventidius's army was waiting. At the [[Battle of Mount Gindarus|Battle of Cyrrhestica]], Ventidius inflicted an overwhelming defeat against the Parthians which resulted in the death of Pacorus. Overall, the Roman army had achieved a complete victory with Ventidius' three successive victories forcing the Parthians back across the Euphrates.<ref>Dando-Collins, 2008, pp. 36\u201339</ref> Pacorus' death threw the Parthian Empire into chaos. Shah Orodes II, overwhelmed by the grief of his son's death, appointed his younger son [[Phraates IV]] as his successor. However, Phraates IV assassinated Orodes II in late 38 BC, succeeding him on the throne.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 49, 23</ref><ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 879, 883</ref>\n\nVentidius feared Antony's wrath if he invaded Parthian territory, thereby stealing his glory; so instead he attacked and subdued the eastern kingdoms, which had revolted against Roman control following the disastrous defeat of Crassus at Carrhae.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', Chapter 34</ref> One such rebel was King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochus]] of [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]], whom he besieged in [[Samosata]]. Antiochus tried to make peace with Ventidius, but Ventidius told him to approach Antony directly. After peace was concluded, Antony sent Ventidius back to Rome where he celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], the first Roman to triumph over the Parthians.{{#tag:ref |After celebrating his triumph, Ventidius disappears from the historical record.|group=\"note\"}}\n\n====Conflict with Sextus Pompey====\n[[File:Mark Antony and Octavia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Antony and Octavia on the [[obverse]] of a [[tetradrachm]] issued at Ephesus in 39 BC. Antony and his brother-in-law, Octavian, enacted a new treaty that year which redivided control over the Roman world.]]\n\nWhile Antony and the other Triumvirs ratified the [[Treaty of Brundisium]] to redivide the Roman world among themselves, the [[Sicilian revolt|rebel general]] [[Sextus Pompey]], the son of Caesar's rival [[Pompey the Great]], was largely ignored. From his stronghold on [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], he continued his piratical activities across Italy and blocked the shipment of grain to Rome. The lack of food in Rome caused the public to blame the Triumvirate and shift its sympathies towards Pompey. This pressure forced the Triumvirs to meet with Sextus in early 39 BC.<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 69</ref>\n\nWhile Octavian wanted an end to the ongoing blockade of Italy, Antony sought peace in the West in order to make the Triumvirate's legions available for his service in his planned campaign against the Parthians. Though the Triumvirs rejected Sextus' initial request to replace Lepidus as the third man within the Triumvirate, they did grant other concessions. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Misenum]], Sextus was allowed to retain control over Sicily and [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia]], with the provinces of [[Corsica et Sardinia|Corsica]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Greece]] being added to his territory. He was also promised a future position with the [[Augur|Priestly College of Augurs]] and the Consulship for 35 BC. In exchange, Sextus agreed to end his naval blockade of Italy, supply Rome with grain, and halt his piracy of Roman merchant ships.<ref>Ward, Allen M., et al. A History of the Roman People. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 2003.</ref> However, the most important provision of the Treaty was the end of the [[proscription]] the Trimumvirate had begun in late 43 BC. Many of the proscribed Senators, rather than face death, fled to Sicily seeking Sextus' protection. With the exception of those responsible for Caesar's assassination, all those proscribed were allowed to return to Rome and promised compensation. This caused Sextus to lose many valuable allies as the formerly exiled Senators gradually aligned themselves with either Octavian or Antony. To secure the peace, Octavian betrothed his three-year-old nephew and Antony's stepson [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] to Sextus' daughter [[Pompeia (daughter of Sextus Pompeius)|Pompeia]].<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 73</ref> With peace in the West secured, Antony planned to retaliate against Parthia by invading their territory. Under an agreement with Octavian, Antony would be supplied with extra troops for his campaign. With this military purpose on his mind, Antony sailed to Greece with Octavia, where he behaved in a most extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[god (male deity)|god]] [[Dionysus]] in 39 BC.\n\n[[File:Marcus Antonius marble bust in the Vatican Museums, side view.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman sculpture|Roman bust]] of Mark Antony, late 1st century AD, [[Vatican Museums]]]]\nThe peace with Sextus was short lived, however. When Sextus demanded control over Greece as the agreement provided, Antony demanded the province's tax revenues be to fund the Parthian campaign. Sextus refused.<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 77</ref> Meanwhile, Sextus' admiral [[Menas (admiral)|Menas]] betrayed him, shifting his loyalty to Octavian and thereby granting him control of Corsica, Sardinia, three of Sextus' legions, and a larger naval force. These actions worked to renew Sextus' blockade of Italy, preventing Octavian from sending the promised troops to Antony for the Parthian campaign. This new delay caused Antony to quarrel with Octavian, forcing [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]] to mediate a truce between them. Under the Treaty of Tarentum, Antony provided a large naval force for Octavian's use against Sextus while Octavian promised to raise new legions for Antony to support his invasion of Parthia.<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 95</ref> As the term of the Triumvirate was set to expire at the end of 38 BC, the two unilaterally extended their term of office another five years until 33 BC without seeking approval of the Senate or the popular assemblies. To seal the Treaty, Antony's elder son [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]], then only 6 years old, was betrothed to Octavian's only daughter [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], then only an infant. With the Treaty signed, Antony returned to the East, leaving Octavia in Italy.\n\n====Reconquest of Judea====\nWith [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] returned to Rome in triumph for his defensive campaign against the Parthians, Antony appointed [[Gaius Sosius]] as the new governor of Syria and Cilicia in early 38 BC. Antony, still in the West negotiating with Octavian, ordered Sosius to depose [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus]], who had been installed in the recent Parthian invasion as the ruler of [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]], and to make [[Herod the Great|Herod]] the new Roman client king in the region. Years before in 40 BC, the Roman Senate had proclaimed Herod \"King of the Jews\" because Herod had been a loyal supporter of [[Hyrcanus II]], Rome's previous client king before the Parthian invasion, and was from a [[Herodian dynasty|family with long standing connections to Rome]].<ref>Armstrong, p. 126</ref> The Romans hoped to use Herod as a bulwark against the Parthians in the coming campaign.<ref>Josephus, ''The Wars of the Jews'', 1.14.4</ref>\n\nAdvancing south, Sosius captured the island-city of [[Arwad|Aradus]] on the coast of [[Phoenicia]] by the end of 38 BC. The following year, the Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (37 BC)|besieged Jerusalem]]. After a forty-day siege, the Roman soldiers stormed the city and, despite Herod's pleas for restraint, acted without mercy, pillaging and killing all in their path, prompting Herod to complain to Antony.<ref>Rocca, 2008, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Herod finally resorted to bribing Sosius and his troops in order that they would not leave him \"king of a desert\".<ref>Josephus, The Jewish Wars, 1:355</ref> Antigonus was forced to surrender to Sosius, and was sent to Antony for the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]] in Rome. Herod, however, fearing that Antigonus would win backing in Rome, bribed Antony to execute Antigonus. Antony, who recognized that Antigonus would remain a permanent threat to Herod, ordered him beheaded in [[Antioch]]. Now secure on his throne, Herod would rule the [[Herodian Kingdom]] until his death in 4 BC, and would be an ever-faithful client king of Rome.\n\n====Parthian Campaign====\n{{main|Antony's Parthian War}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nWith the Triumvirate renewed in 38 BC, Antony returned to Athens in the winter with his new wife [[Octavia Major|Octavia]], the sister of Octavian. With the assassination of the Parthian king [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]] by his son [[Phraates IV]], who then seized the Parthian throne, in late 38 BC, Antony prepared to invade Parthia himself.\n[[File:Tardo tolemaico o periodo romano, testa di nobile romano, forse marc'antonio, 30 ac-50 dc ca., forse da alessandria.JPG|thumb|A late [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] or [[Roman art|Roman]] sculpted head of an [[Alexandria]]n nobleman, perhaps a depiction of Mark Antony, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nAntony, however, realized Octavian had no intention of sending him the additional legions he had promised under the Treaty of Tarentum. To supplement his own armies, Antony instead looked to Rome's principal vassal in the East: his lover Cleopatra. In addition to significant financial resources, Cleopatra's backing of his Parthian campaign allowed Antony to amass the largest army Rome had ever assembled in the East. Wintering in [[Antioch]] during 37, Antony's combined Roman\u2013Egyptian army numbered some 200,000, including sixteen legions (approximately 160,000 soldiers) plus an additional 40,000 auxiliaries.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Such a force was twice the size of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]'s army from his failed Parthian invasion of 53 BC and three times those of [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] during the [[Mithridatic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The size of his army indicated Antony's intention to conquer Parthia, or at least receive its submission by capturing the Parthian capital of [[Ecbatana]]. Antony's rear was protected by Rome's client kingdoms in Anatolia, Syria, and Judea, while the client kingdoms of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Commagene would provide supplies along the march.\n\nAntony's first target for his invasion was the [[kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. Ruled by King [[Artavasdes II of Armenia]], Armenia had been an ally of Rome since the defeat of [[Tigranes the Great]] by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]] in 66 BC during the [[Third Mithridatic War]]. However, following [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC, Armenia was forced into an alliance with Parthia due to Rome's weakened position in the East. Antony dispatched [[Publius Canidius Crassus]] to Armenia, receiving Artavasdes II's surrender without opposition. Canidius then led an invasion into the [[Transcaucasia]], subduing [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]. There, Canidius forced the Iberian King [[Pharnavaz II of Iberia|Pharnavaz II]] into an alliance against Zober, king of neighboring [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], subduing the kingdom and reducing it to a Roman protectorate.\n\nWith Armenia and the Caucasus secured, Antony marched south, crossing into the Parthian province of [[Media Atropatene]]. Though Antony desired a pitched battle, the Parthians would not engage, allowing Antony to march deep into Parthian territory by mid-August of 36 BC. This forced Antony to leave his logistics train in the care of two legions (approximately 10,000 soldiers), which was then attacked and completely destroyed by the Parthian army before Antony could rescue them. Though the Armenian King Artavasdes II and his cavalry were present during the massacre, they did not intervene. Despite the ambush, Antony continued the campaign. However, Antony was soon forced to retreat in mid-October after a failed two-month siege of the provincial capital.\n\nThe retreat soon proved a disaster as Antony's demoralized army faced increasing supply difficulties in the mountainous terrain during winter while constantly being harassed by the Parthian army. According to the Greek historian [[Plutarch]], eighteen battles were fought between the retreating Romans and the Parthians during the month-long march back to Armenia, with approximately 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry dying during the retreat alone. Once in Armenia, Antony quickly marched back to [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to protect his interests there by late 36 BC, losing an additional 8,000 soldiers along the way. In all, two-fifths of his original army (some 80,000 men) had died during his failed campaign.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Antony and Cleopatra===\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra VII|Reign of Cleopatra VII}}\nMeanwhile, in Rome, the triumvirate was no more. Octavian forced Lepidus to resign after the older triumvir attempted to take control of Sicily after the defeat of Sextus. Now in sole power, Octavian was occupied in wooing the traditional Republican aristocracy to his side. He married [[Livia]] and started to attack Antony in order to raise himself to power. He argued that Antony was a man of low morals to have left his faithful wife abandoned in Rome with the children to be with the promiscuous queen of Egypt. Antony was accused of everything, but most of all, of \"[[wikt:Special:Search/go native|going native]]\", an unforgivable crime to the proud Romans. Several times Antony was summoned to Rome, but remained in Alexandria with Cleopatra.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Romans From Village to Empire|last = Boatwright|first = Mary|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199735075|location = New York|pages = 269\u201371}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Donations of Alexandria 34BC.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[map]] of the ''[[Donations of Alexandria]]'' (by Mark Antony to Cleopatra and her children) in 34 BC.\n{{legend|#81EE5B|Unallotted Roman territory}}{{legend|#27c600|Donations to Cleopatra's Children}}{{legend|#1a8000|Cleopatra's Original Kingdom}}]]\n\nAgain with Egyptian money, Antony invaded Armenia, this time successfully. In the return, a mock [[Roman triumph]] was celebrated in the streets of Alexandria. The parade through the city was a [[pastiche]] of Rome's most important military celebration. For the finale, the whole city was summoned to hear a very important political statement. Surrounded by Cleopatra and her children, Antony ended his alliance with Octavian.\n\nHe distributed kingdoms among his children: [[Alexander Helios]] was named king of [[Armenia]], [[Medes|Media]] and [[Parthia]] (territories which were not for the most part under the control of Rome), his twin [[Cleopatra Selene II|Cleopatra Selene]] got [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]], and the young [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] was awarded Syria and [[Cilicia]]. As for Cleopatra, she was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with [[Caesarion]] (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of Cleopatra by Julius Caesar), King of Kings and King of Egypt. Most important of all, Caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of Caesar. These proclamations were known as the ''[[Donations of Alexandria]]'' and caused a fatal breach in Antony's relations with Rome.\n\nWhile the distribution of nations among Cleopatra's children was hardly a conciliatory gesture, it did not pose an immediate threat to Octavian's political position. Far more dangerous was the acknowledgment of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Caesar's name. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through [[Adoption in Rome|adoption]], which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions. To see this convenient situation attacked by a child borne by the richest woman in the world was something Octavian could not accept. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not renewed. Another civil war was beginning.\n\nDuring 33 and 32 BC, a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of Rome, with accusations flying between sides. Antony (in Egypt) divorced Octavia and accused Octavian of being a social upstart, of usurping power, and of forging the adoption papers by Caesar. Octavian responded with treason charges: of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by [[Cleromancy|lots]], as was Rome's tradition, and of starting wars against foreign nations (Armenia and Parthia) without the consent of the Senate.\n\nAntony was also held responsible for [[Sextus Pompey]]'s execution without a trial. In 32 BC, the Senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra \u2013 not Antony, because Octavian had no wish to advertise his role in perpetuating Rome's internecine bloodshed. Both consuls, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and [[Gaius Sosius]], and a third of the Senate abandoned Rome to meet Antony and Cleopatra in Greece.\n\n[[Image:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Actium'' (1672) by [[Laureys a Castro]] ([[National Maritime Museum]], London)]]\nIn 31 BC, the war started. Octavian's general [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] captured the Greek city and naval port of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methone]], loyal to Antony. The enormous popularity of Octavian with the legions secured the defection of the provinces of Cyrenaica and Greece to his side. On September 2, the naval [[Battle of Actium]] took place. Antony and Cleopatra's navy was overwhelmed, and they were forced to escape to Egypt with 60 ships.\n\n===Death===\n{{main|Death of Cleopatra}}\n{{further|Epaphroditus (freedman of Augustus)|Tomb of Antony and Cleopatra}}\n[[File:Venus and Cupid from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII.jpg|thumb|250px|This mid-1st-century-BC [[Pompeian Styles|Roman wall painting]] in [[Pompeii]], Italy, showing [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] holding a [[cupid]] is most likely a depiction of [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as [[Venus Genetrix]], with her son [[Caesarion]] as the cupid, similar in appearance to the now lost statue of Cleopatra erected by [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]] (within the [[Forum of Caesar]]). The owner of the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii walled off the room with this painting, most likely in immediate reaction to the execution of Caesarion on orders of [[Augustus]] in 30 BC, when artistic depictions of Caesarion would have been considered [[Damnatio memoriae|a sensitive issue]] for the ruling regime.<ref>Roller (2010), 175.</ref><ref>Walker (2008), 35, 42\u201344.</ref>]]\n\nOctavian, now close to absolute power, did not intend to give Antony and Cleopatra any rest. In August 30 BC, assisted by Agrippa, he invaded Egypt. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony committed suicide by stabbing himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so. When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monument in which she was hiding, and he died in her arms.\n\nCleopatra was allowed to conduct Antony's burial rites after she had been captured by Octavian. Realising that she was destined for Octavian's [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in Rome, she made several attempts to take her life and finally succeeded in mid-August. Octavian had Caesarion murdered, but he spared Antony's children by Cleopatra, who were paraded through the streets of Rome. Antony's daughters by Octavia were spared, as was his son, [[Iullus Antonius]].  But his elder son, [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]], was killed by Octavian's men while pleading for his life in the [[Caesareum]].\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n\n[[Cicero]]'s son, [[Cicero Minor]], announced Antony's death to the senate.<ref>Dio 51.19.4.</ref> Antony's honours were revoked and his statues removed,<ref>Plut. ''Ant.'' 49.4; Dio 51.19.3.</ref> but he was not subject to a complete [[damnatio memoriae]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Akert|first1=Nick|title=Antony, Augustus, and Damnatio Memoriae|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=discentesjournal|website=University of Pennsylvania|publisher=Discentes|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> Cicero Minor also made a decree that no member of the [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]] would ever bear the name [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]] again.<ref>Plut. ''Ant.'' 49.4; Dio 51.19.4.</ref> \"In this way Heaven entrusted the family of Cicero the final acts in the punishment of Antony.\"<ref>Plut. ''Ant.'' 49.4.</ref>\n\nWhen Antony died, Octavian became uncontested ruler of Rome. In the following years, Octavian, who was known as [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] after 27 BC, managed to accumulate in his person all administrative, political, and military offices. When Augustus died in AD 14, his political powers passed to his adopted son [[Tiberius]]; the [[Roman Empire]] had begun.\n\nThe rise of Caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the Roman [[oligarchy]] as a governing power and ensured that all future power struggles would centre upon which one individual would achieve supreme control of the government, eliminating the Senate and the former magisterial structure as important foci of power in these conflicts. Thus, in history, Antony appears as one of Caesar's main adherents, he and Octavian Augustus being the two men around whom power coalesced following the assassination of Caesar, and finally as one of the three men chiefly responsible for the demise of the [[Roman Republic]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Romans From Village to Empire|last = Boatwright|first = Mary|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199730575|location = New York|pages = 269\u201379}}</ref>\n\n==Marriages and issue==\n[[File:1448 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Octavia, ca. 30 BC - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Fragmentary [[Roman portraiture|portrait bust]] from [[Smyrna]] thought to depict Octavia, sister of Octavian and Antony's wife]]\n[[File:Antiochia (forse), tetradracma di cleopatra VII e marcantonio, 36 ac ca.JPG|thumb|A [[tetradrachm]] of Marcus Antonius and [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]]]\nAntony was known to have an obsession with women, and sex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historycollection.co/really-romes-womanizer-chief-5-interesting-facts-mark-antony/|title=5 Fascinating Facts About Mark Antony|date=2017-02-28|website=HistoryCollection.co|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Mark_Antony/|title=Mark Antony|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ancient.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/who-were-antonys-wives-119726|title=How Many Wives Did Mark Anthony Have?|last=classics|first=N.

Antony was appointed administrator of Italy while Caesar eliminated political opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain. After [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's death]] in 44 BC, Antony joined forces with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], another of Caesar's generals, and [[Augustus|Octavian]], Caesar's great-nephew and adopted son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the [[Second Triumvirate]]. The Triumvirs defeated Caesar's murderers, the [[Liberatores]], at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, and divided the government of the Republic between themselves. Antony was assigned Rome's eastern provinces, including the [[Client state|client kingdom]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]], then ruled by [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII Philopator]], and was given the command in [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars|Rome's war against Parthia]].\n\nRelations among the triumvirs were strained as the various members sought greater political power. Civil war between Antony and Octavian was averted in 40 BC, when Antony married Octavian's sister, [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]. Despite this marriage, Antony carried on a love affair with Cleopatra, who bore him three children, further straining Antony's relations with Octavian. [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] was expelled from the association in 36 BC, and in 33 BC disagreements between Antony and Octavian caused a split between the remaining Triumvirs.  Their ongoing hostility erupted into [[Final War of the Roman Republic|civil war]] in 31 BC, as the [[Roman Senate]], at Octavian's direction, declared war on Cleopatra and proclaimed Antony a traitor.

[[Pharaoh]] [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] had been deposed in a rebellion led by his daughter [[Berenice IV of Egypt|Berenice IV]] in 58 BC, forcing him to seek asylum in Rome. During Pompey's conquests years earlier, Ptolemy had received the support of Pompey, who named him an ally of Rome.<ref>Siani-Davis, 1997, p. 316</ref> Gabinius' invasion sought to restore Ptolemy to his throne. This was done against the orders of the Senate but with the approval of Pompey, then Rome's leading politician, and only after the deposed king provided a 10,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] bribe.

In 60 BC, a [[First Triumvirate|secret agreement]] (known as the \"First Triumvirate\") was entered into between three men to control the Republic: [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]], and [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. Crassus, Rome's wealthiest man, had defeated the [[Third Servile War|slave rebellion of Spartacus]] in 70 BC; Pompey [[Third Mithridatic War|conquered much of the Eastern Mediterranean]] in the 60's BC; Caesar was Rome's [[Pontifex Maximus]] and a former general in [[Roman Spain|Spain]]. In 59 BC, Caesar, with funding from Crassus, was elected Consul to pursue legislation favourable to Crassus and Pompey's interests. In return, Caesar was assigned the governorship of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Cisalpine Gaul]], and [[Transalpine Gaul]] for five years beginning in 58 BC. Caesar used his governorship as a launching point for his [[Gallic Wars|conquest of free Gaul]]. In 55 BC, Crassus and Pompey served as Consuls while Caesar's command was extended for another five years. Rome was effectively under the absolute power of these three men.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 27\u201331</ref><ref>Martin, 2003, pp. 174\u201377</ref> The Triumvirate used [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], Antony's patron, to exile their political rivals, notably Cicero<ref>Haskell, 1964, p. 201</ref> and [[Cato the Younger]].\n\nDuring his early military service, Antony married his cousin [[Antonia Hybrida Minor]], the daughter of [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]]. Sometime between 54 and 47 BC, the union produced a single daughter, [[Antonia (daughter of Mark Antony)|Antonia Prima]]. It is unclear if this was Antony's first marriage.{{#tag:ref|Cicero is the only ancient source to mention a first marriage to an otherwise unknown Fadia (''Philippics'', XIII, 10)|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===Service under Caesar===\n\n====Gallic Wars====\n{{see also|Gallic Wars}}\n[[File:Europe -50.png|thumb|350px|right|The ancient Mediterranean in 50 BC at the end of Caesar's [[Gallic Wars]], with the territory of Rome in yellow.]]\n\nAntony's association with [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] allowed him to achieve greater prominence. Clodius, through the influence of his benefactor [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had developed a positive political relationship with [[Julius Caesar]]. Clodius secured Antony a position on Caesar's [[military staff]] in 54 BC, joining his [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]]. Serving under Caesar, Antony demonstrated excellent military leadership. Despite a temporary alienation later in life, Antony and Caesar developed friendly relations which would continue until Caesar's assassination in 44 BC. Caesar's influence secured greater political advancement for Antony. After a year of service in Gaul, Caesar dispatched Antony to Rome to formally begin his [[cursus honorum|political career]], receiving election as [[Quaestor]] for 52 BC as a member of the [[Populares]] faction. Assigned to assist Caesar, Antony returned to Gaul and commanded Caesar's cavalry during his victory at the [[Battle of Alesia]] against the Gallic High King [[Vercingetorix]]. Following his year in office, Antony was promoted by Caesar to the rank of [[Legatus|Legate]] and assigned command of two legions (approximately 7,500 total soldiers).<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, p. 33</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the alliance among Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus had effectively ended. Caesar's daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], who had married Pompey to secure the alliance, died in 54 BC while Crassus was killed at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC. Without the stability they provided, the divide between Caesar and Pompey grew ever larger.<ref name=\"Holland, Rubicon, p. 287\">Holland, Rubicon, p. 287</ref> Caesar's glory in conquering Gaul had served to further strain his alliance with Pompey,<ref name=\"Holland, Rubicon, p. 287\"/> who, having grown jealous of his former ally, had drifted away from Caesar's democratic Populares party towards the oligarchic [[Optimates]] faction led by Cato. The supporters of Caesar, led by Clodius, and the supporters of Pompey, led by [[Titus Annius Milo]], routinely clashed. In 52 BC, Milo succeeded in assassinating Clodius, resulting in widespread riots and the burning of the Senate meeting house, the [[Curia Hostilia]], by Clodius' street gang. [[Anarchy]] resulted, causing the Senate to look to Pompey. Fearing the persecutions of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] only thirty-years earlier, they avoided granting Pompey the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] by instead naming him sole Consul for the year, giving him extraordinary but limited powers. Pompey ordered armed soldiers into the city to restore order and to eliminate the remnants of Clodius' gang.<ref>Gruen, 1974, pp. 233\u201334</ref>\n\nAntony remained on Caesar's military staff until 50 BC, helping mopping-up actions across Gaul to secure Caesar's conquest. With the war over, Antony was sent back to Rome to act as Caesar's protector against Pompey and the other Optimates. With the support of Caesar, who as [[Pontifex Maximus]] was head of the Roman religion, Antony was appointed the [[augur|College of Augurs]], an important priestly office responsible for interpreting the will of the [[Roman gods]] by studying the flight of birds. All public actions required favorable auspices, granting the college considerable influence. Antony was then elected as one of the ten [[Tribune of the Plebs|People's Tribunes]] for 49 BC. In this position, Antony could protect Caesar from his political enemies by vetoing any actions unfavorable to his patron.\n\n====Civil War====\n{{see also|Caesar's Civil War}}\n[[File:Marcus Porcius Cato.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Cato the Younger]], a member of the [[Optimates]] faction, was one of the chief architects of the decree which provoked Caesar into civil war.]]\n\nThe feud between Caesar and Pompey erupted into open confrontation by early 49 BC. The Consuls for the year, [[Gaius Claudius Marcellus Maior]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus]], were firm Optimates opposed to Caesar.<ref>Caesar, [http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/gallic.8.8.html#847 ''B.G.'' 8.50]</ref> Pompey, though remaining in Rome, was then serving as the governor of [[Roman Spain|Spain]] and commanded several legions. Upon assuming office in January, Antony immediately summoned a meeting of the Senate to resolve the conflict: he proposed both Caesar and Pompey lay down their commands and return to the status of mere [[privatus|private citizens]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 6</ref> His proposal was well received by most of the senators but the Consuls and Cato vehemently opposed it. Antony then made a new proposal: Caesar would retain only two of his eight legions and the governorship of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyrium]] if he was allowed to stand for the Consulship ''in absentia''. This arrangement ensured his [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from [[suit (law)|suit]] would continue: he had needed the Consulship to protect himself from prosecution by Pompey. Though Pompey found the concession satisfactory, Cato and Lentulus refused to back down, with Lentulus even expelling Antony from the Senate meeting by force. Antony fled Rome, fearing for his life, and returned to Caesar's camp on the banks of the [[Rubicon|Rubicon River]], the southern limit of Caesar's lawful command.\n\nWithin days of Antony's expulsion, on 7 January 49 BC, the Senate reconvened. Under the leadership of Cato and with the tacit support of Pompey, the Senate passed the \"final decree\" (''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'') stripping Caesar of his command and ordering him to return to Rome and stand trial for [[war crimes]]. The Senate further declared Caesar a [[traitor]] and a [[public enemy]] if he did not immediately disband his army.<ref>Caesar, [http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/civil.1.1.html#149 ''B.C.'' i.5]</ref> With all hopes of finding a peaceful solution gone after Antony's expulsion, Caesar used Antony as a pretext for marching on Rome. As Tribune, Antony's person was [[sacrosanct]] and therefore it was unlawful to harm him or refuse to recognize his veto. Three days later, on 10 January, Caesar [[Crossing the Rubicon|crossed the Rubicon River]], starting a [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Pompey'', 56.4</ref>  During the southern march, Caesar placed Antony as his second in command.\n\nCaesar's rapid advance surprised Pompey, who, along with the other chief members of the Optimates, fled Italy for Greece. After entering Rome, instead of pursuing Pompey, Caesar marched to [[Hispania|Spain]] to defeat Pompeian-loyalists there. Meanwhile, Antony, with the rank of [[Propraetor]] despite never having served as [[Praetor]], was installed as governor of Italy and commander of the army, stationed there while [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], one of Caesar's staff officers, ran the provisional administration of Rome itself.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 786</ref><ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 39\u201340</ref> Though Antony was well liked by his soldiers, most other citizens despised him for his lack of interest in the hardships they faced from the civil war.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 8</ref>\n\nBy the end of the year 49 BC, Caesar, already the ruler of Gaul, had captured Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia out of Optimates control. In early 48 BC, he prepared to sail with seven legions to Greece to face Pompey. Caesar had entrusted the defense of Illyricum to [[Gaius Antonius]], Antony's younger brother, and [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]]. Pompey's forces, however, defeated them and assumed control of the [[Adriatic Sea]] along with it. Additionally, the two legions they commanded defected to Pompey. Without their fleet, Caesar lacked the necessary transport ships to cross into Greece with his seven legions. Instead, he sailed with only two and placed Antony in command of the remaining five at [[Brundisium]] with instructions to join him as soon as he was able. In early 48 BC, [[Lucius Scribonius Libo (consul 34 BC)|Lucius Scribonius Libo]] was given command of Pompey's fleet, comprising some fifty galleys.<ref name=\"Broughton, pg. 281\">Broughton, p. 281</ref><ref>Holmes, p. 127</ref> Moving off to Brundisium, he blockaded Antony. Antony, however, managed to trick Libo into pursuing some decoy ships, causing Libo's squadron to be trapped and attacked. Most of Libo's fleet managed to escape, but several of his troops were trapped and captured.<ref name=\"Broughton, pg. 281\"/><ref>Holmes, p. 128</ref> With Libo gone, Antony joined Caesar in Greece by March 48 BC.\n\n[[File:Battle of Pharsalus, 48 BC.gif|thumb|left|350px|The [[Battle of Pharsalus]]: the decisive battle of Caesar's Civil War. Antony commanded the left wing of Caesar's army.]]\nDuring the Greek campaign, Plutarch records Antony was Caesar's top general and second to only him in reputation.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 10\">Plutarch, ''Antony'', 10</ref> Antony joined Caesar at the western [[Balkan Peninsula]] and [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|besieged Pompey's larger army]] at [[Dyrrhachium]]. With food sources running low, Caesar, in July, ordered a nocturnal assault on Pompey's camp, but Pompey's larger forces pushed back the assault. Though an indecisive result, the victory was a tactical win for Pompey. Pompey, however, did not order a counter-assault on Caesar's camp, allowing Caesar to retreat unhindered. Caesar would later remark the civil war would have ended that day if Pompey had only attacked him.<ref>Plutarch, ''Pompey'', 65</ref> Caesar managed to retreat to [[Thessaly]], with Pompey in pursuit.\n\nAssuming a defensive position at the plain of [[Pharsalus]], Caesar's army prepared for pitched battle with Pompey's, which outnumbered his own two to one. At the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] on 9 August 48 BC, Caesar commanded the right wing opposite Pompey while Antony commanded the left, indicating Antony's status as Caesar's top general.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 10\"/> The resulting battle was a decisive victory for Caesar. Though the civil war had not ended at Pharsulus, the battle marked the pinnacle of Caesar's power and effectively ended the Republic.<ref>Davis, 1999, p. 59</ref> The battle gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy, as prior to the battle much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and the Optimates as the legitimate government of Rome. After Pompey's defeat, most of the Senate defected to Caesar, including many of the soldiers who had fought under Pompey. Pompey himself fled to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], but Pharaoh [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator]] feared retribution from Caesar and had Pompey assassinated upon his arrival.\n\n====Governor of Italy====\n[[File:CdM, marcantonio raffigurato come alessandro, sardonice, 40 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|A [[Cameo (carving)|cameo carving]] of Mark Antony depicted as [[Alexander the Great]], c. 40 BC]]\n\nInstead of immediately pursuing Pompey and the remaining Optimates, Caesar returned to Rome and was appointed [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] with Antony as his [[Master of the Horse]] and second in command.<ref name=Plu37>Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#37 37.2]</ref> Caesar presided over his own election to a second Consulship for 47 BC and then, after eleven days in office, resigned this dictatorship.<ref>Jehne, 1987, pp. 15\u201338</ref> Caesar then sailed to Egypt, where he deposed Ptolemy XIII in favor of his sister [[Cleopatra]] in 47 BC. The young Cleopatra became Caesar's mistress and bore him a son, [[Caesarion]]. Caesar's actions further strengthened Roman control over the already Roman-dominated kingdom.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\nWhile Caesar was away in Egypt, Antony remained in Rome to govern Italy and restore order.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 796 and 798\">Hinard, 2000, pp. 796, 798</ref> Without Caesar to guide him, however, Antony quickly faced political difficulties and proved himself unpopular. The chief cause of his political challenges concerned [[debt forgiveness]]. One of the Tribunes for 47 BC, [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]], a former general under Pompey, proposed a law which would have canceled all outstanding debts. Antony opposed the law for political and personal reasons: he believed Caesar would not support such massive relief and suspected Dolabella had seduced his wife Antonia Hybrida Minor. When Dolabella sought to enact the law by force and seized the [[Roman Forum]],\nAntony responded by unleashing his soldiers upon the assembled masses.<ref>Plutarch: ''Antony'', c. 9, in ''Plutarch, Roman Lives'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-282502-5}}</ref> The resulting instability, especially among Caesar's veterans who would have benefited from the law, forced Caesar to return to Italy by October 47 BC.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 796 and 798\"/>\n\nAntony's handling of the affair with Dolabella caused a cooling of his relationship with Caesar. Antony's violent reaction had caused Rome to fall into a state of [[anarchy]]. Caesar sought to mend relations with the populist leader; he was elected to a third term as Consul for 46 BC, but proposed the Senate should transfer the consulship to Dolabella. When Antony protested, Caesar was forced to withdraw the motion out of shame. Later, Caesar sought to exercise his prerogatives as Dictator and directly proclaim Dolabella as Consul instead.<ref>Dio 43.51.8.</ref> Antony again protested and, in his capacity as an Augur, declared the omens were unfavorable and Caesar again backed down.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 11.3, less clear from Dio.</ref> Seeing the expediency of removing Dolabella from [[Rome]], Caesar ultimately pardoned him for his role in the riots and took him as one of his generals in his campaigns against the remaining Optimates resistance.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Antony, 10\"/> Antony, however, was stripped of all official positions and received no appointments for the year 46 BC or 45 BC. Instead of Antony, Caesar appointed [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] to be his Consular colleague for 46 BC. While Caesar campaigned in [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]], Antony remained in Rome as a mere [[privatus|private citizen]]. After returning victorious from North Africa, Caesar was appointed [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] for ten years and brought Cleopatra and their son to Rome. Antony again remained in Rome while Caesar, in 45 BC, sailed to Spain to defeat the final opposition to his rule. When Caesar returned in late 45 BC, the civil war was over.\n\nDuring this time Antony married his third wife, [[Fulvia]]. Following the scandal with Dolabella, Antony had divorced his second wife and quickly married Fulvia. Fulvia had previously been married to both [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] and [[Gaius Scribonius Curio (praetor 49 BC)|Gaius Scribonius Curio]], having been a widow since Curio's death in the [[Battle of the Bagradas (49 BC)|battle of the Bagradas]] in 49 BC. Though Antony and Fulvia were formally married in 47 BC, Cicero suggests the two had been in a relationship since at least 58 BC.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D48 Cicero.Phil.2.48.]</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D99 Cicero.Phil.2.99.]</ref> The union produced two children: [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]] (born 47) and [[Iullus Antonius]] (born 45)\n\n===Assassination of Caesar===\n{{main|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}\n\n==== Ides of March====\nWhatever conflicts existed between himself and Caesar, Antony remained faithful to Caesar, ensuring their estrangement did not last long.

Caesar planned a new [[Roman-Parthian Wars|invasion of Parthia]] and desired to leave Antony in Italy to govern Rome in his name.

Caesar had enacted a number of [[Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar|constitutional reforms]] which centralized effectively all political powers within his own hands. He was granted further honors, including a form of semi-official [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]], with Antony as his high priest.<ref>Fuller, Chapter 13</ref> Additionally, the day before the festival, Caesar had been named [[Roman dictator|Dictator for Life]], effectively granting unlimited power. Caesar's political rivals feared these reforms were his attempts at transforming the Republic into an open monarchy. During the festival's activities, Antony publicly offered Caesar a [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], which Caesar refused. The event presented a powerful message: a diadem was a symbol of a king. By refusing it, Caesar demonstrated he had no intention of making himself King of Rome. Antony's motive for such actions is not clear and it is unknown if he acted with Caesar's prior approval or on his own.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 12</ref>\n[[File:Marc Antony's Oration at Caesar's Funeral by George Edward Robertson.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|\"Marc Antony's Oration at Caesar's Funeral\" as depicted by George Edward Robertson]]\n\nA group of Senators resolved to kill Caesar to prevent him from seizing the throne. Chief among them were [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]. Although Cassius was \"the moving spirit\" in the plot, winning over the chief assassins to the cause of [[tyrannicide]], Brutus, with his family's history of deposing Rome's kings, became their leader.<ref>Broughton, p. 320</ref> [[Cicero]], though not personally involved in the conspiracy, later claimed Antony's actions sealed Caesar's fate as such an obvious display of Caesar's preeminence motivated them to act.<ref>Cicero, ''2nd Philippic'', 34</ref> Originally, the conspirators had planned to eliminate not only Caesar but also many of his supporters, including Antony, but Brutus rejected the proposal, limiting the conspiracy to Caesar alone.<ref>[[Velleius Paterculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#58 2.58.5]; [[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#18 18.2\u20136].</ref> With Caesar preparing to depart for [[Parthia]] in late March, the conspirators prepared to act when Caesar appeared for the Senate meeting on the [[Ides of March]] (15 March).\n\nAntony was supposed to attend with Caesar, but was waylaid at the door by one of the plotters and prevented from intervening. According to the Greek historian [[Plutarch]], as Caesar arrived at the Senate, [[Tillius Cimber|Lucius Tillius Cimber]] presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/m_brutus.html Plutarch \u2013 Life of Brutus]</ref> The other conspirators crowded round to offer their support. Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenseless on the lower steps of the portico. According to Roman historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], around 60 or more men participated in the assassination. Caesar was stabbed 23 times and died from the blood loss attributable to multiple stab wounds.<ref>Woolf</ref><ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'', c. 82.</ref>\n\n====Leader of the Caesarian Party====\nIn the turmoil surrounding the assassination, Antony escaped Rome dressed as a slave, fearing Caesar's death would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters. When this did not occur, he soon returned to Rome. The conspirators, who styled themselves the ''[[Liberatores]]'' (\"The Liberators\"), had barricaded themselves on the [[Capitoline Hill]] for their own safety. Though they believed Caesar's death would restore the Republic, Caesar had been immensely popular with the [[Plebeians|Roman middle and lower classes]], who became enraged upon learning a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion.\n\nAntony, as the sole Consul, soon took the initiative and seized the state treasury. [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]], Caesar's widow, presented him with Caesar's personal papers and custody of his extensive property, clearly marking him as Caesar's heir and leader of the Caesarian faction.<ref>David, 2000, p. 246</ref> Caesar's [[Magister Equitum|Master of the Horse]] [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] marched over 6,000 troops into Rome on 16 March to restore order and to act as the bodyguards of the Caesarian faction. Lepidus wanted to storm the Capitol, but Antony preferred a peaceful solution as a majority of both the Liberators and Caesar's own supporters preferred a settlement over civil war.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, p. 64</ref> On 17 March, at Antony's arrangement, the Senate met to discuss a compromise, which, due to the presence of Caesar's veterans in the city, was quickly reached. Caesar's assassins would be pardoned of their crimes and, in return, all of Caesar's actions would be ratified.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', 14</ref> In particular, the offices assigned to both Brutus and Cassius by Caesar were likewise ratified. Antony also agreed to accept the appointment of his rival Dolabella as his Consular colleague to replace Caesar.<ref>Bramstedt, 2004, p. 143</ref> Having neither troops, money, nor popular support, the Liberatores were forced to accept Antony's proposal. This compromise was a great success for Antony, who managed to simultaneously appease Caesar's veterans, reconcile the Senate majority, and appear to the Liberatores as their partner and protector.<ref>Hinard, 2000, 827</ref>\n\n[[File:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Augustus|Octavian]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s adopted son. Antony would struggle with Octavian for leadership of the Caesarian party following Caesar's assassination.]]\nOn 19 March, Caesar's will was opened and read. In it, Caesar posthumously adopted his great-nephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] and named him his principal heir. Then only 19 years old and stationed with Caesar's army in Macedonia, the youth became a member of Caesar's [[Julia (gens)|Julian clan]], changing his name to \"Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus\" (Octavian) in accordance with the conventions of [[Roman adoption]]. Though not the chief beneficiary, Antony did receive some bequests.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 832</ref>\n\nShortly after the compromise was reached, as a sign of good faith, Brutus, against the advice of Cassius and Cicero, agreed Caesar would be given a public funeral and his will would be validated. Caesar's funeral was held on 20 March. Antony, as Caesar's faithful lieutenant and reigning Consul, was chosen to preside over the ceremony and to recite the [[elegy]]. During the [[demagogue|demagogic]] speech, he enumerated the deeds of Caesar and, publicly reading his will, detailed the donations Caesar had left to the Roman people. Antony then seized the blood-stained [[toga]] from Caesar's body and presented it to the crowd. Worked into a fury by the bloody spectacle, the assembly [[rioted]]. Several buildings in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and some houses of the conspirators were burned to the ground. Panicked, many of the conspirators fled Italy.<ref>Eck (2003), p. 10</ref> Under the pretext of not being able to guarantee their safety, Antony relieved Brutus and Cassius of their judicial duties in Rome and instead assigned them responsibility for procuring wheat for Rome from Sicily and Asia. Such an assignment, in addition to being unworthy of their rank, would have kept them far from Rome and shifted the balance towards Antony. Refusing such secondary duties, the two traveled to Greece instead. Additionally, Cleopatra left Rome to return to Egypt.\n\nDespite the provisions of Caesar's will, Antony proceeded to act as leader of the Caesarian faction, including appropriating for himself a portion of Caesar's fortune rightfully belonging to Octavian. Antony enacted the [[Lex Antonia]], which formally abolished the Dictatorship, in an attempt to consolidate his power by gaining the support of the Senatorial class. He also enacted a number of laws he claimed to have found in Caesar's papers to ensure his popularity with Caesar's veterans, particularly by providing [[land grants]] to them. Lepidus, with Antony's support, was named [[Pontifex Maximus]] to succeed Caesar. To solidify the alliance between Antony and Lepidus, Antony's daughter [[Antonia (daughter of Mark Antony)|Antonia Prima]] was engaged to Lepidus's son, also named [[Lepidus the Younger|Lepidus]]. Surrounding himself with a bodyguard of over six thousand of Caesar's veterans, Antony presented himself as Caesar's true successor, largely ignoring Octavian.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 248</ref>\n\n====First conflict with Octavian====\nOctavian arrived in Rome in May to claim his inheritance. Although Antony had amassed political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the Caesarian faction. The Senatorial Republicans increasingly viewed Antony as a new tyrant. Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 11.</ref> When Antony refused to relinquish Caesar's vast fortune to him, Octavian borrowed heavily to fulfill the bequests in Caesar's will to the Roman people and to his veterans, as well as to establish his own bodyguard of veterans.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Romans From Village to Empire|last = Boatwright|first = Mary|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199730575|location = New York|pages = 272\u201373}}</ref> This earned him the support of Caesarian sympathizers who hoped to use him as a means of eliminating Antony.<ref>Syme, 1939, pp. 114\u201320.</ref> The Senate, and Cicero in particular, viewed Antony as the greater danger of the two. By summer 44 BC, Antony was in a difficult position due to his actions regarding his compromise with the Liberatores following Caesar's assassination. He could either denounce the Liberatores as murderers and alienate the Senate or he could maintain his support for the compromise and risk betraying the legacy of Caesar, strengthening Octavian's position. In either case, his situation as ruler of Rome would be weakened. Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]] later recorded that while Antony, as reigning Consul, maintained the advantage in the relationship, the general affection of the Roman people was shifting to Octavian due to his status as Caesar's son.<ref>Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', XLV, 11</ref><ref>Bleicken, 1998, p. 58</ref>\n\n[[File:MarcusAntoniusCVibiusVarus.jpg|thumb|A [[denarius]] of Marcus Antonius struck in 42 BC]]\nSupporting the Senatorial faction against Antony, Octavian, in September 44 BC, encouraged the leading Senator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] to attack Antony in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]] portraying him as a threat to the Republican order.<ref>Chisholm, 1981, p. 26.</ref><ref>Rowell, 1962, p. 30</ref> Risk of civil war between Antony and Octavian grew. Octavian continued to recruit Caesar's veterans to his side, away from Antony, with two of Antony's legions defecting in November 44 BC. At that time, Octavian, only a [[privatus|private citizen]], lacked legal authority to command the Republic's armies, making his command illegal. With popular opinion in Rome turning against him and his Consular term nearing its end, Antony attempted to secure a favorable military assignment to secure an army to protect himself. The Senate, as was custom, assigned Antony and Dolabella the provinces of [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Roman Syria|Syria]], respectively, to govern in 43 BC after their Consular terms expired. Antony, however, objected to the assignment, preferring to govern [[Cisalpine Gaul]] which had been assigned to [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], one of Caesar's assassins.<ref>Eck 2003, pp. 11\u201312.</ref><ref>Rowell, 1962, p. 21</ref> When Decimus refused to surrender his province, Antony marched north in December 44 BC with his remaining soldiers to take the province by force, besieging Decimus at [[Mutina]].<ref>Rowell, 1962, p. 24</ref> The Senate, led by a fiery Cicero, denounced Antony's actions and declared him an [[outlaw]].\n\nRatifying Octavian's extraordinary command on 1 January 43 BC, the Senate dispatched him along with Consuls [[Aulus Hirtius|Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]] to defeat Antony and his five legions.<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 12</ref><ref>Syme, 1939, p. 167</ref> Antony's forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Mutina]] in April 43 BC, forcing Antony to retreat to [[Transalpine Gaul]].

[[Sextus Pompey]], son of Caesar's old rival [[Pompey|Pompey Magnus]], was given command of the Republic's fleet from his base in Sicily while Brutus and Cassius were granted the governorships of [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Roman Syria|Syria]] respectively. These appointments attempted to renew the \"Republican\" cause.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 838</ref> However, the eight legions serving under Octavian, composed largely of Caesar's veterans, refused to follow one of Caesar's murderers, allowing Octavian to retain his command. Meanwhile, Antony recovered his position by joining forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been assigned the governorship of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Transalpine Gaul]] and [[Hispania Citerior|Nearer Spain]].<ref>Syme, 1939, pp. 176\u201386.</ref> Antony sent Lepidus to Rome to broker a conciliation. Though he was an ardent Caesarian, Lepidus had maintained friendly relations with the Senate and with Sextus Pompey. His legions, however, quickly joined Antony, giving him control over seventeen legions, the largest army in the West.<ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 839\u201340</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman-Empire-43BC.png|thumb|450px|Map of the [[Roman Republic]] in 43 BC after the establishment of the [[Second Triumvirate]]: {{colbegin|colwidth=200px}}\n{{legend|#81EE5B|Antony}}{{legend|#C19666|Lepidus}}{{legend|#DE8DE0|Octavian}}{{legend|#FF925E|Triumvirs collectively}}\n{{legend|#7D87FF|Sextus Pompey}}{{legend|#ED1C24|The Liberators}}{{legend|#FED250|Rome's client kingdoms}}{{legend|#FF8C8C|Ptolemaic Egypt}}{{colend}}]]\n\nBy mid-May, Octavian began secret negotiations to form an alliance with Antony to provide a united Caesarian party against the Liberators. Remaining in Cisalpine Gaul, Octavian dispatched emissaries to Rome in July 43 BC demanding he be appointed Consul to replace Hirtius and Pansa and that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy be rescinded.<ref>Rowell, 1962, pp. 26\u201327</ref> When the Senate refused, Octavian marched on Rome with his eight legions and assumed control of the city in August 43 BC. Octavian proclaimed himself Consul, rewarded his soldiers, and then set about prosecuting Caesar's murderers. By the [[Quintus Pedius|lex Pedia]], all of the conspirators and Sextus Pompey were convicted \u2033in absentia\u2033 and declared public enemies. Then, at the instigation of Lepidus, Octavian went to Cisalpine Gaul to meet Antony.\n\nIn November 43 BC, Octavian, Lepidus, and Antony met near [[Bologna|Bononia]].<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 15</ref> After two days of discussions, the group agreed to establish a [[Second Triumvirate|three man dictatorship]] to govern the Republic for five years, known as the \"Three Men for the Restoration of the Republic\" (Latin: \"Triumviri Rei publicae Constituendae\"), known to modern historians as the Second Triumvirate. They shared military command of the Republic's armies and provinces among themselves: Antony received Gaul, Lepidus Spain, and Octavian (as the junior partner) Africa. They jointly governed Italy. The Triumvirate would have to conquer the rest of Rome's holdings; Brutus and Cassius held the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], and Sextus Pompey held the Mediterranean islands.<ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 841\u201342</ref> On 27 November 43 BC, the Triumvirate was formally established by a new law, the [[lex Titia]]. Octavian and Antony reinforced their alliance through Octavian's marriage to Antony's stepdaughter, [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]].\n[[File:Fulvia y Marco Antonio, o La venganza de Fulvia (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|The vengeance of Fulvia by Francisco Maura Y Montaner, 1888, depicting Fulvia, Antony's wife, inspecting the severed head of Cicero]]\nThe primary objective of the Triumvirate was to avenge Caesar's death and to make war upon his murderers. Before marching against Brutus and Cassius in the East, the Triumvirs issued [[proscription]]s against their enemies in Rome. The Dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] had taken similar action to purge Rome of his opponents in 82 BC. The proscribed were named on public lists, stripped of citizenship, and outlawed. Their wealth and property were confiscated by the state, and rewards were offered to anyone who secured their arrest or death. With such encouragements, the proscription produced deadly results; two thousand [[Roman aristocracy|Roman knights]] were executed, and one third of the Senate, among them [[Cicero]], who was executed on 7 December. The confiscations helped replenish the [[Aerarium|State Treasury]], which had been depleted by Caesar's civil war the decade before; when this seemed insufficient to fund the imminent war against Brutus and Cassius, the Triumvirs imposed new taxes, especially on the wealthy. By January 42 BC the proscription had ended; it had lasted two months, and though less bloody than Sulla's, it traumatized Roman society. A number of those named and outlawed had fled to either Sextus Pompey in Sicily or to the Liberators in the East.<ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 846\u201347</ref> Senators who swore loyalty to the Triumvirate were allowed to keep their positions; on 1 January 42 BC, the senate officially deified Caesar as \"[[Divus Julius|The Divine Julius]]\", and confirmed Antony's position as his high priest.\n\n====War against the Liberators====\n{{main|Liberators' civil war|Battle of Philippi}}\n\nDue to the infighting within the Triumvirate during 43 BC, Brutus and Cassius had assumed control of much of Rome's eastern territories, and amassed a large army. Before the Triumvirate could cross the [[Adriatic Sea]] into Greece where the Liberators had stationed their army, the Triumvirate had to address the threat posed by Sextus Pompey and his fleet. From his base in Sicily, Sextus raided the Italian coast and blockaded the Triumvirs. Octavian's friend and admiral [[Quintus Salvidienus Rufus]] thwarted an attack by Sextus against the southern Italian mainland at [[Rhegium]], but Salvidienus was then defeated in the resulting naval battle because of the inexperience of his crews. Only when Antony arrived with his fleet was the blockade broken. Though the blockade was defeated, control of Sicily remained in Sextus's hand, but the defeat of the Liberators was the Triumvirate's first priority.\n\n[[File:Phil2.png|300px|thumb|right|First Battle of Philippi \u2013 3 October 42 BC]]\n[[File:Phil3.png|300px|thumb|right|Second Battle of Philippi \u2013 23 October 42 BC]]\nIn the summer of 42 BC, Octavian and Antony sailed for Macedonia to face the Liberators with nineteen legions, the vast majority of their army<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 14, CVIII</ref> (approximately 100,000 regular infantry plus supporting cavalry and irregular auxiliary units), leaving Rome under the administration of Lepidus. Likewise, the army of the Liberators also commanded an army of nineteen legions; their legions, however, were not at full strength while the legions of Antony and Octavian were.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While the Triumvirs commanded a larger number of infantry, the Liberators commanded a larger cavalry contingent.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 850</ref> The Liberators, who controlled Macedonia, did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the Triumvirs' communications with their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest and had gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the Eastern provinces and levies from Rome's client kingdoms.\n\nBrutus and Cassius held a position on the high ground along both sides of the [[via Egnatia]] west of the city of [[Philippi]]. The south position was anchored to a supposedly impassable marsh, while the north was bordered by impervious hills. They had plenty of time to fortify their position with a rampart and a ditch. Brutus put his camp on the north while Cassius occupied the south of the via Egnatia. Antony arrived shortly and positioned his army on the south of the via Egnatia, while Octavian put his legions north of the road. Antony offered battle several times, but the Liberators were not lured to leave their defensive stand. Thus, Antony tried to secretly outflank the Liberators' position through the marshes in the south. This provoked a pitched battle on 3 October 42 BC. Antony commanded the Triumvirate's army due to Octavian's sickness on the day, with Antony directly controlling the right flank opposite Cassius. Because of his health, Octavian remained in camp while his lieutenants assumed a position on the left flank opposite Brutus. In the resulting first battle of Philippi, Antony defeated Cassius and captured his camp while Brutus overran Octavian's troops and penetrated into the Triumvirs' camp but was unable to capture the sick Octavian. The battle was a tactical draw but due to poor communications Cassius believed the battle was a complete defeat and committed suicide to prevent being captured.\n\nBrutus assumed sole command of the Liberator army and preferred a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] over open conflict. His officers, however, were dissatisfied with these defensive tactics and his Caesarian veterans threatened to defect, forcing Brutus to give battle at the second battle of Philippi on 23 October. While the battle was initially evenly matched, Antony's leadership routed Brutus's forces. Brutus committed suicide the day after the defeat and the remainder of his army swore allegiance to the Triumvirate. Over fifty thousand Romans died in the two battles. While Antony treated the losers mildly, Octavian dealt cruelly with his prisoners and even beheaded Brutus's corpse.<ref>Jallet-Huant, 2009, pp. 144\u201353</ref><ref>Hindard, 2000, pp. 850\u201351</ref><ref>Cosme, 2009, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nThe battles of Philippi ended the civil war in favor of the Caesarian faction. With the defeat of the Liberators, only Sextus Pompey and his fleet remained to challenge the Triumvirate's control over the Republic.\n\n==Master of the Roman East==\n\n===Division of the Republic===\n[[File:Roman-Empire-42BC.png|thumb|450px|Map of the [[Roman Republic]] in 42 BC after the [[Battle of Philippi]]: {{colbegin|colwidth=200px}}\n{{legend|#81EE5B|Antony}}{{legend|#C19666|Lepidus}}{{legend|#DE8DE0|Octavian}}{{legend|#FF925E|Triumvirs collectively}}\n{{legend|#7D87FF|Sextus Pompey}}{{legend|#ED1C24|Parthian Empire}}{{legend|#FED250|Rome's client kingdoms}}{{legend|#FF8C8C|Ptolemaic Egypt}}{{colend}}]]\n\nThe victory at Philippi left the members of the Triumvirate as masters of the Republic, save [[Sextus Pompey]] in Sicily. Upon returning to Rome, the Triumvirate repartitioned rule of Rome's provinces among themselves, with Antony as the clear senior partner. He received the largest distribution, governing all of the Eastern provinces while retaining [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in the West. Octavian's position improved, as he received Spain, which was taken from Lepidus. Lepidus was then reduced to holding only Africa, and he assumed a clearly tertiary role in the Triumvirate. Rule over Italy remained undivided, but Octavian was assigned the difficult and unpopular task of demobilizing their veterans and providing them with land distributions in Italy.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 854</ref><ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 253</ref> Antony assumed direct control of the East while he installed one of his lieutenants as the ruler of Gaul. During his absence, several of his supporters held key positions in Rome to protect his interests there.\n\nThe East was in need of reorganization after the rule of the Liberators in the previous years. In addition, Rome contended with the [[Parthian Empire]] for dominance of the [[Near East]]. The Parthian threat to the Triumvirate's rule was urgent due to the fact that the Parthians supported the Liberators in the recent civil war, aid which included the supply troops at Philippi.<ref>Bivar, 1968, pp. 56\u201357</ref> As ruler of the East, Antony also assumed responsibility for overseeing Caesar's planned invasion of Parthia to avenge the defeat of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC.\n\nIn 42 BC, the Roman East was composed of several directly controlled provinces and [[Client state|client kingdoms]]. The provinces included [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia]], [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]], [[Roman Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], and [[Creta et Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]]. Approximately half of the eastern territory was controlled by Rome's client kingdoms, nominally independent kingdoms subject to Roman direction. These kingdoms included:\n* [[Odrysian Kingdom|Odrysian Thrace]] in [[Eastern Europe]]\n* The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] along the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]]\n* [[Galatia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Artaxiad dynasty|Armenia]], and several smaller kingdoms in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]\n* [[Hasmonean dynasty|Judea]], [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]], and the [[Nabataean kingdom]] in the [[Middle East]]\n* [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] in Africa\n\n===Activities in the East===\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra VII|Reign of Cleopatra VII}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = -0035 Altes Museum Portrait Kleopatra VII anagoria.JPG\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cleopatra VII, Marble, 40-30 BC, Vatican Museums 001.jpg\n| width2 = 220\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left image: [[Cleopatra VII]] bust in the [[Altes Museum]], [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], Roman artwork, 1st century BC<br>Right: bust of Cleopatra VII, dated 40\u201330 BC, [[Vatican Museums]], showing her with a 'melon' hairstyle and [[Hellenistic]] royal [[diadem]] worn over her head\n}}\n\nAntony spent the winter of 42 BC in [[Athens]], where he ruled generously towards the Greek cities. A proclaimed ''[[philhellene]]'' (\"Friend of all things Greek\"), Antony supported Greek culture to win the loyalty of the inhabitants of the Greek East. He attended religious festivals and ceremonies, including initiation into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]],<ref>Hinard 2000, p. 854</ref> a secret cult dedicated to the worship of the goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]. Beginning in 41 BC, he traveled across the [[Aegean Sea]] to [[Anatolia]], leaving his friend [[Lucius Marcius Censorinus (consul 39 BC)|Lucius Marcius Censorius]] as governor of [[Roman Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Upon his arrival in [[Ephesus]] in Asia, Antony was worshiped as the god [[Dionysus]] born anew.<ref>Lepelley, 1998, p. 435</ref> He demanded heavy taxes from the Hellenic cities in return for his pro-Greek culture policies, but exempted those cities which had remained loyal to Caesar during the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] and compensated those cities which had suffered under [[Liberators' civil war|Caesar's assassins]], including [[Rhodes]], [[Lycia et Pamphylia|Lycia]], and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. He granted pardons to all Roman nobles living in the East who had supported the [[Optimate]] cause, except for Caesar's assassins.\n\nRuling from Ephesus, Antony consolidated Rome's hegemony in the East, receiving envoys from Rome's client kingdoms and intervening in their dynastic affairs, extracting enormous financial \"gifts\" from them in the process. Though King [[Deiotarus]] of [[Galatia]] supported Brutus and Cassius following Caesar's assassination, Antony allowed him to retain his position. He also confirmed [[Ariarathes X of Cappadocia|Ariarathes X]] as king of [[Cappadocia]] after the execution of his brother [[Ariobarzanes III of Cappadocia]] by Cassius before the [[Battle of Philippi]]. In [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]], several Jewish delegations complained to Antony of the harsh rule of [[Phasael]] and [[Herod the Great|Herod]], the sons of Rome's assassinated chief Jewish minister [[Antipater the Idumaean]]. After Herod offered him a large financial gift, Antony confirmed the brothers in their positions.

Antony had first met a young Cleopatra while campaigning in Egypt in 55 BC and again in 48 BC when Caesar had backed her as queen of Egypt over the claims of her half-sister [[Arsinoe IV of Egypt|Arsinoe]]. Cleopatra would bear Caesar a son, [[Caesarion]], in 47 BC and the two living in Rome as Caesar's guests until his assassination in 44 BC. After Caesar's assassination, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt, where she named the child as her co-ruler. In 42 BC, the Triumvirate, in recognition for Cleopatra's help towards [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] in opposition to the Liberators, granted official recognition to Caesarion's position as king of Egypt. Arriving in Tarsus aboard her magnificent ship, Cleopatra invited Antony to a grand banquet to solidify their alliance. {{#tag:ref |Ancient writers (e.g. Appian, ''Civil Wars'' 5.8.1) place the beginning of their famous romance at this meeting with Antony totally surrendering to Cleopatra's beauty but modern historians reject this notion as retrospective historical propaganda on the part of [[Augustus]].|group=\"note\"}} As the most powerful of Rome's eastern vassals, Egypt was indispensable in Rome's planned military invasion of the [[Parthian Empire]]. At Cleopatra's request, Antony ordered the execution of Arsinoe, who, though marched in Caesar's [[Roman triumph|triumphal parade]] in 46 BC,<ref>Dio, 43.19.2\u20133; Appian, 2.101.420</ref> had been granted sanctuary at the [[temple of Artemis]] in Ephesus. Antony and Cleopatra then spent the winter of 41 BC together in [[Alexandria]]. Cleopatra bore Antony twin children, [[Alexander Helios]] and [[Cleopatra Selene II]], in 40 BC, and a third, Ptolemy Philadelphus, in 36 BC. Antony also granted formal control over Cyprus, which had been under Egyptian control since 47 BC during the turmoil of [[Caesar's civil war]], to Cleopatra in 40 BC as a gift for her loyalty to Rome.<ref>Mitford, pp. 1289\u201397.</ref>\n\nAntony, in his first months in the East, raised money, reorganized his troops, and secured the alliance of Rome's client kingdoms. He also promoted himself as Hellenistic ruler, which won him the affection of the Greek peoples of the East but also made him the target of Octavian's propaganda in Rome. According to some ancient authors, Antony led a carefree life of luxury in Alexandria.<ref>Plutarch, Antony, 28\u201330</ref><ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', l. 48.</ref> Upon learning the [[Parthian Empire]] had invaded Rome's territory in early 40 BC, Antony left Egypt for Syria to confront the invasion. However, after a short stay in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], he was forced to sail with his army to Italy to confront Octavian due to [[Perusine War|Octavian's war against Antony's wife and brother]].\n\n===Fulvia's Civil War===\n{{See also|Perusine War}}\n\nFollowing the defeat of Brutus and Cassius, while Antony was stationed in the East, Octavian had authority over the West.{{#tag:ref |Lepidus, though still a member of the Triumvirate, was relegated to a junior position within the three-man dictatorship as Antony and Octavian established themselves.|group=\"note\"}} Octavian's chief responsibility was distributing land to tens of thousands of Caesar's veterans who had fought for the Triumvirate. Additionally, tens of thousands of veterans who had fought for the Republican cause in the war also required land grants. This was necessary to ensure they would not support a political opponent of the Triumvirate.<ref>Eck, p. 18</ref> However, the Triumvirs did not possess sufficient state-controlled land to allot to the veterans. This left Octavian with two choices: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who might back a military rebellion against the Triumvirate's rule. Octavian chose the former.<ref>Eck, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> As many as eighteen Roman towns through Italy were affected by the confiscations of 41 BC, with entire populations driven out.<ref name=\"Eck, pg 19\">Eck, p. 19</ref>\n\nLed by [[Fulvia]], the wife of Antony, the Senators grew hostile towards Octavian over the issue of the land confiscations. According to the ancient historian [[Cassius Dio]], Fulvia was the most powerful woman in Rome at the time.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.+Phil.+2.48&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021 Cassius Dio.48.4.1\u20136]</ref> According to Dio, while [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BC)|Publius Servilius Vatia]] and [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]] were the Consuls for the year 41 BC, real power was vested in Fulvia.

Tensions escalated into open war, however, when Octavian divorced [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], Fulvia's daughter from her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. Outraged, Fulvia, supported by Lucius, raised an army to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. According to the ancient historian [[Appian]], Fulvia's chief reason for the war was her jealousy of Antony's affairs with Cleopatra in Egypt and desire to draw Antony back to Rome.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0232%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D19 Appian.B.Civ.5.3.19.]</ref> Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian and Lepidus, however, as the Roman army still depended on the Triumvirs for their salaries.<ref name=\"Eck, pg 19\"/> Lucius and Fulvia, supported by their army, marched on Rome and promised the people an end to the Triumvirate in favor of Antony's sole rule. However, when Octavian returned to the city with his army, the pair was forced to retreat to [[Perusia]] in Etruria. Octavian placed the city under siege while Lucius waited for Antony's legions in [[Gaul]] to come to his aid.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0232%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D32 Appian.B.Civ.5.4.32.]</ref><ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html Cassius Dio 48.15.1.]</ref> Away in the East and embarrassed by Fulvia's actions, Antony gave no instructions to his legions.<ref>David, 2000, p. 254</ref>{{#tag:ref |It is also speculated that Antony's legions, composed largely of Caesarian veterans, did not wish to fight the adoptive son of their former general.|group=\"note\"}}  Without reinforcements, Lucius and Fulvia were forced to surrender in February 40 BC. While Octavian pardoned Lucius for his role in the war and even granted him command in Spain as his chief lieutenant there, Fulvia was forced to flee to Greece with her children. With the war over, Octavian was left in sole control over Italy. When Antony's governor of Gaul died, Octavian took over his legions there, further strengthening his control over the West.<ref>Southern, 2001, p. 78</ref>\n\nDespite the Parthian Empire's invasion of Rome's eastern territories, Fulvia's civil war forced Antony to leave the East and return to Rome in order to secure his position. Meeting her in Athens, Antony rebuked Fulvia for her actions before sailing on to Italy with his army to face Octavian, laying siege to [[Brundisium]]. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their shared service under Caesar. The legions under their command followed suit.<ref>Eck, 2003, p. 21.</ref><ref>Eder, 2005, p. 19</ref> Meanwhile, in [[Sicyon]], Fulvia died of a sudden and unknown illness.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0007%3Achapter%3D30%3Asection%3D3 Plutarch.Vit.Ant.30.3.]</ref> Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their soldiers allowed the triumvirs to effect a reconciliation through a new power sharing agreement in September 40 BC. The Roman world was redivided, with Antony receiving the Eastern provinces, Octavian the Western provinces, and Lepidus relegated to a clearly junior position as governor of Africa. This agreement, known as the ''Treaty of Brundisium'', reinforced the Triumvirate and allowed Antony to begin preparing for Caesar's long-awaited campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]]. As a symbol of their renewed alliance, Antony married [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]], Octavian's sister, in October 40 BC.\n\n===Antony's Parthian War===\n{{main|Antony's Parthian War}}\n\n====Roman\u2013Parthian relations====\n[[File:Parther reich.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the [[Parthian Empire]]. Parthia shared its western border along the [[Euphrates River]] with Rome.]]\n\nThe rise of the [[Parthian Empire]] in the 3rd century BC and Rome's expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean during the 2nd century BC brought the two powers into direct contact, causing centuries of tumultuous and strained relations. Though periods of peace developed cultural and commercial exchanges, war was a constant threat. Influence over the [[buffer state]] of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], located to the north-east of [[Roman Syria]], was often a central issue in the Roman-Parthian conflict. In 95 BC, Parthian [[Shah]] [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], installed [[Tigranes the Great]] as Parthian's client-king over Armenia. Tigranes would wage [[Mithridatic Wars|a series of three wars against Rome]] before being ultimately defeated by [[Pompey]] in 66 BC.<ref>Scullard, 1984, p. 106</ref> Thereafter, with his son [[Artavasdes II of Armenia|Artavasdes II]] in Rome as a hostage, Tigranes would rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55 BC.<ref>Fuller, 1965, p. 45</ref> Rome then installed Artavasdes II as king and continued its influence over Armenia.\n\nIn 53 BC, Rome's governor of Syria, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], led an expedition across the [[Euphrates]] River into Parthian territory to confront the Parthian Shah [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]]. Artavasdes II offered Crassus the aid of nearly forty thousand troops to assist his Parthian expedition on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia as the safer route.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus''. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html 19.1\u20133].</ref> Crassus refused, choosing instead the more direct route by crossing the Euphrates directly into desert Parthian territory. Crassus' actions proved disastrous as his army was defeated at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] by a numerically inferior Parthian force. Crassus' defeat forced Armenia to shift its loyalty to Parthia, with Artavasdes II's sister marrying Orodes' son and heir [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Crassus'' 19; 22; 33.</ref>\n\nIn early 44 BC, Julius Caesar announced his intentions to invade Parthia and restore Roman power in the East. His reasons were to punish the Parthians for assisting Pompey in the [[Caesar's Civil War|recent civil war]], to avenge Crassus' defeat at Carrhae, and especially to match the glory of [[Alexander the Great]] for himself.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 820</ref> Before Caesar could launch his campaign, however, he was assassinated. As part of the compromise between Antony and the Republicans to restore order following Caesar's murder, [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] was assigned the governorship of Syria and command over Caesar's planned Parthian campaign. The compromise did not hold, however, and the Republicans were forced to flee to the East. The Republicans directed [[Quintus Labienus]] to attract the Parthians to their side in the [[Liberators' civil war|resulting war against Antony and Octavian]]. After the Republicans were defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]], Labienus joined the Parthians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morello|first=Antonio|title=Titus Labienus et Cingulum, Quintus Labienus Parthicus Volume 9 of Nummus et historia|year=2005|publisher=Circolo numismatico Mario Rasile|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Titus_Labienus_et_Cingulum.html?id=Ipk_YgEACAAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Coins of Rome about Parthia: Quintus Labienus (42-39 B.C.)|url=http://www.parthia.com/labienus.htm|accessdate=5 February 2013}}</ref> Despite Rome's internal turmoil during the time, the Parthians did not immediately benefit from the [[power vacuum]] in the East due to Orodes II's reluctance despite Labienus' urgings to the contrary.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 857\">Hinard, 2000, p. 857</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 41 BC, Antony, to reassert Roman power in the East, conquered [[Palmyra]] on the Roman-Parthian border.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 857\"/> Antony then spent the winter of 41 BC in Alexandria with Cleopatra, leaving only two legions to defend the Syrian border against Parthian incursions.

Labienus, the Republican ally of Brutus and Cassius, accompanied him to advise him and to rally the former Republican soldiers stationed in Syria to the Parthian cause. Labienus recruited many of the former Republican soldiers to the Parthian campaign in opposition to Antony. The joint Parthian\u2013Roman force, after initial success in Syria, separated to lead their offensive in two directions: Pacorus marched south toward [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]] while Labienus crossed the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the north into [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]]. Labienus conquered southern [[Anatolia]] with little resistance. The Roman governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]], a partisan of Antony, was forced to flee his province, allowing Labienus to recruit the Roman soldiers stationed there. For his part, Pacorus advanced south to [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]]. In [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]], the exiled prince [[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]] allied himself with the Parthians. When his brother, Rome's client king [[Hyrcanus II]], refused to accept Parthian domination, he was deposed in favor of Antigonus as Parthia's client king in Judea. Pacorus' conquest had captured much of the Syrian and Palestinian interior, with much of the Phoenician coast occupied as well. The city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] remained the last major Roman outpost in the region.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 858\">Hinard, 2000, p. 858</ref>\n\nAntony, then in Egypt with Cleopatra, did not respond immediately to the Parthian invasion. Though he left Alexandria for Tyre in early 40 BC, when he learned of [[Perusine War|the civil war between his wife and Octavian]], he was forced to return to Italy with his army to secure his position in Rome rather than defeat the Parthians.<ref name=\"Hinard, 2000, pg 858\"/> Instead, Antony dispatched [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] to check the Parthian advance. Arriving in the East in spring 39 BC, Ventidius surprised Labienus near the [[Taurus Mountains]], claiming victory at [[Battle of the Cilician Gates|the Cilician Gates]]. Ventidius ordered Labienus executed as a traitor and the formerly rebellious Roman soldiers under his command were reincorporated under Antony's control. He then met a Parthian army at the border between Cilicia and Syria, defeating it and killing a large portion of the Parthian soldiers at [[Battle of Amanus Pass|the Amanus Pass]]. Ventidius's actions temporarily halted the Parthian advance and restored Roman authority in the East, forcing Pacorus to abandon his conquests and return to Parthia.<ref>Hinard, 2000, p. 877</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 38 BC, the Parthians resumed their offensive with Pacorus leading an army across the Euphrates. Ventidius, in order to gain time, leaked [[disinformation]] to Pacorus implying that he should cross the Euphrates River at their usual ford. Pacorus did not trust this information and decided to cross the river much farther downstream; this was what Ventidius hoped would occur and gave him time to get his forces ready.<ref>Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', pp.  1239</ref> The Parthians faced no opposition and proceeded to the town of [[Gindarus]] in [[Cyrrhestica]] where Ventidius's army was waiting. At the [[Battle of Mount Gindarus|Battle of Cyrrhestica]], Ventidius inflicted an overwhelming defeat against the Parthians which resulted in the death of Pacorus. Overall, the Roman army had achieved a complete victory with Ventidius' three successive victories forcing the Parthians back across the Euphrates.<ref>Dando-Collins, 2008, pp. 36\u201339</ref> Pacorus' death threw the Parthian Empire into chaos. Shah Orodes II, overwhelmed by the grief of his son's death, appointed his younger son [[Phraates IV]] as his successor. However, Phraates IV assassinated Orodes II in late 38 BC, succeeding him on the throne.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 49, 23</ref><ref>Hinard, 2000, pp. 879, 883</ref>\n\nVentidius feared Antony's wrath if he invaded Parthian territory, thereby stealing his glory; so instead he attacked and subdued the eastern kingdoms, which had revolted against Roman control following the disastrous defeat of Crassus at Carrhae.<ref>Plutarch, ''Antony'', Chapter 34</ref> One such rebel was King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochus]] of [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]], whom he besieged in [[Samosata]]. Antiochus tried to make peace with Ventidius, but Ventidius told him to approach Antony directly. After peace was concluded, Antony sent Ventidius back to Rome where he celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], the first Roman to triumph over the Parthians.{{#tag:ref |After celebrating his triumph, Ventidius disappears from the historical record.|group=\"note\"}}\n\n====Conflict with Sextus Pompey====\n[[File:Mark Antony and Octavia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Antony and Octavia on the [[obverse]] of a [[tetradrachm]] issued at Ephesus in 39 BC. Antony and his brother-in-law, Octavian, enacted a new treaty that year which redivided control over the Roman world.]]\n\nWhile Antony and the other Triumvirs ratified the [[Treaty of Brundisium]] to redivide the Roman world among themselves, the [[Sicilian revolt|rebel general]] [[Sextus Pompey]], the son of Caesar's rival [[Pompey the Great]], was largely ignored. From his stronghold on [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], he continued his piratical activities across Italy and blocked the shipment of grain to Rome. The lack of food in Rome caused the public to blame the Triumvirate and shift its sympathies towards Pompey. This pressure forced the Triumvirs to meet with Sextus in early 39 BC.<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 69</ref>\n\nWhile Octavian wanted an end to the ongoing blockade of Italy, Antony sought peace in the West in order to make the Triumvirate's legions available for his service in his planned campaign against the Parthians. Though the Triumvirs rejected Sextus' initial request to replace Lepidus as the third man within the Triumvirate, they did grant other concessions. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Misenum]], Sextus was allowed to retain control over Sicily and [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia]], with the provinces of [[Corsica et Sardinia|Corsica]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Greece]] being added to his territory. He was also promised a future position with the [[Augur|Priestly College of Augurs]] and the Consulship for 35 BC. In exchange, Sextus agreed to end his naval blockade of Italy, supply Rome with grain, and halt his piracy of Roman merchant ships.<ref>Ward, Allen M., et al. A History of the Roman People. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 2003.</ref> However, the most important provision of the Treaty was the end of the [[proscription]] the Trimumvirate had begun in late 43 BC. Many of the proscribed Senators, rather than face death, fled to Sicily seeking Sextus' protection. With the exception of those responsible for Caesar's assassination, all those proscribed were allowed to return to Rome and promised compensation. This caused Sextus to lose many valuable allies as the formerly exiled Senators gradually aligned themselves with either Octavian or Antony. To secure the peace, Octavian betrothed his three-year-old nephew and Antony's stepson [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] to Sextus' daughter [[Pompeia (daughter of Sextus Pompeius)|Pompeia]].<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 73</ref> With peace in the West secured, Antony planned to retaliate against Parthia by invading their territory. Under an agreement with Octavian, Antony would be supplied with extra troops for his campaign. With this military purpose on his mind, Antony sailed to Greece with Octavia, where he behaved in a most extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[god (male deity)|god]] [[Dionysus]] in 39 BC.\n\n[[File:Marcus Antonius marble bust in the Vatican Museums, side view.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman sculpture|Roman bust]] of Mark Antony, late 1st century AD, [[Vatican Museums]]]]\nThe peace with Sextus was short lived, however. When Sextus demanded control over Greece as the agreement provided, Antony demanded the province's tax revenues be to fund the Parthian campaign. Sextus refused.<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 77</ref> Meanwhile, Sextus' admiral [[Menas (admiral)|Menas]] betrayed him, shifting his loyalty to Octavian and thereby granting him control of Corsica, Sardinia, three of Sextus' legions, and a larger naval force. These actions worked to renew Sextus' blockade of Italy, preventing Octavian from sending the promised troops to Antony for the Parthian campaign. This new delay caused Antony to quarrel with Octavian, forcing [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]] to mediate a truce between them. Under the Treaty of Tarentum, Antony provided a large naval force for Octavian's use against Sextus while Octavian promised to raise new legions for Antony to support his invasion of Parthia.<ref>Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 5, 95</ref> As the term of the Triumvirate was set to expire at the end of 38 BC, the two unilaterally extended their term of office another five years until 33 BC without seeking approval of the Senate or the popular assemblies. To seal the Treaty, Antony's elder son [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]], then only 6 years old, was betrothed to Octavian's only daughter [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], then only an infant. With the Treaty signed, Antony returned to the East, leaving Octavia in Italy.\n\n====Reconquest of Judea====\nWith [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] returned to Rome in triumph for his defensive campaign against the Parthians, Antony appointed [[Gaius Sosius]] as the new governor of Syria and Cilicia in early 38 BC. Antony, still in the West negotiating with Octavian, ordered Sosius to depose [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus]], who had been installed in the recent Parthian invasion as the ruler of [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]], and to make [[Herod the Great|Herod]] the new Roman client king in the region. Years before in 40 BC, the Roman Senate had proclaimed Herod \"King of the Jews\" because Herod had been a loyal supporter of [[Hyrcanus II]], Rome's previous client king before the Parthian invasion, and was from a [[Herodian dynasty|family with long standing connections to Rome]].<ref>Armstrong, p. 126</ref> The Romans hoped to use Herod as a bulwark against the Parthians in the coming campaign.<ref>Josephus, ''The Wars of the Jews'', 1.14.4</ref>\n\nAdvancing south, Sosius captured the island-city of [[Arwad|Aradus]] on the coast of [[Phoenicia]] by the end of 38 BC. The following year, the Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (37 BC)|besieged Jerusalem]]. After a forty-day siege, the Roman soldiers stormed the city and, despite Herod's pleas for restraint, acted without mercy, pillaging and killing all in their path, prompting Herod to complain to Antony.<ref>Rocca, 2008, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Herod finally resorted to bribing Sosius and his troops in order that they would not leave him \"king of a desert\".<ref>Josephus, The Jewish Wars, 1:355</ref> Antigonus was forced to surrender to Sosius, and was sent to Antony for the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]] in Rome. Herod, however, fearing that Antigonus would win backing in Rome, bribed Antony to execute Antigonus. Antony, who recognized that Antigonus would remain a permanent threat to Herod, ordered him beheaded in [[Antioch]]. Now secure on his throne, Herod would rule the [[Herodian Kingdom]] until his death in 4 BC, and would be an ever-faithful client king of Rome.\n\n====Parthian Campaign====\n{{main|Antony's Parthian War}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nWith the Triumvirate renewed in 38 BC, Antony returned to Athens in the winter with his new wife [[Octavia Major|Octavia]], the sister of Octavian. With the assassination of the Parthian king [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]] by his son [[Phraates IV]], who then seized the Parthian throne, in late 38 BC, Antony prepared to invade Parthia himself.\n[[File:Tardo tolemaico o periodo romano, testa di nobile romano, forse marc'antonio, 30 ac-50 dc ca., forse da alessandria.JPG|thumb|A late [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] or [[Roman art|Roman]] sculpted head of an [[Alexandria]]n nobleman, perhaps a depiction of Mark Antony, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nAntony, however, realized Octavian had no intention of sending him the additional legions he had promised under the Treaty of Tarentum. To supplement his own armies, Antony instead looked to Rome's principal vassal in the East: his lover Cleopatra. In addition to significant financial resources, Cleopatra's backing of his Parthian campaign allowed Antony to amass the largest army Rome had ever assembled in the East. Wintering in [[Antioch]] during 37, Antony's combined Roman\u2013Egyptian army numbered some 200,000, including sixteen legions (approximately 160,000 soldiers) plus an additional 40,000 auxiliaries.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Such a force was twice the size of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]'s army from his failed Parthian invasion of 53 BC and three times those of [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] during the [[Mithridatic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The size of his army indicated Antony's intention to conquer Parthia, or at least receive its submission by capturing the Parthian capital of [[Ecbatana]]. Antony's rear was protected by Rome's client kingdoms in Anatolia, Syria, and Judea, while the client kingdoms of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Commagene would provide supplies along the march.\n\nAntony's first target for his invasion was the [[kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. Ruled by King [[Artavasdes II of Armenia]], Armenia had been an ally of Rome since the defeat of [[Tigranes the Great]] by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]] in 66 BC during the [[Third Mithridatic War]]. However, following [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC, Armenia was forced into an alliance with Parthia due to Rome's weakened position in the East. Antony dispatched [[Publius Canidius Crassus]] to Armenia, receiving Artavasdes II's surrender without opposition. Canidius then led an invasion into the [[Transcaucasia]], subduing [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]. There, Canidius forced the Iberian King [[Pharnavaz II of Iberia|Pharnavaz II]] into an alliance against Zober, king of neighboring [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], subduing the kingdom and reducing it to a Roman protectorate.\n\nWith Armenia and the Caucasus secured, Antony marched south, crossing into the Parthian province of [[Media Atropatene]]. Though Antony desired a pitched battle, the Parthians would not engage, allowing Antony to march deep into Parthian territory by mid-August of 36 BC. This forced Antony to leave his logistics train in the care of two legions (approximately 10,000 soldiers), which was then attacked and completely destroyed by the Parthian army before Antony could rescue them. Though the Armenian King Artavasdes II and his cavalry were present during the massacre, they did not intervene. Despite the ambush, Antony continued the campaign. However, Antony was soon forced to retreat in mid-October after a failed two-month siege of the provincial capital.\n\nThe retreat soon proved a disaster as Antony's demoralized army faced increasing supply difficulties in the mountainous terrain during winter while constantly being harassed by the Parthian army. According to the Greek historian [[Plutarch]], eighteen battles were fought between the retreating Romans and the Parthians during the month-long march back to Armenia, with approximately 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry dying during the retreat alone. Once in Armenia, Antony quickly marched back to [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to protect his interests there by late 36 BC, losing an additional 8,000 soldiers along the way. In all, two-fifths of his original army (some 80,000 men) had died during his failed campaign.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Antony and Cleopatra===\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra VII|Reign of Cleopatra VII}}\nMeanwhile, in Rome, the triumvirate was no more. Octavian forced Lepidus to resign after the older triumvir attempted to take control of Sicily after the defeat of Sextus. Now in sole power, Octavian was occupied in wooing the traditional Republican aristocracy to his side. He married [[Livia]] and started to attack Antony in order to raise himself to power. He argued that Antony was a man of low morals to have left his faithful wife abandoned in Rome with the children to be with the promiscuous queen of Egypt. Antony was accused of everything, but most of all, of \"[[wikt:Special:Search/go native|going native]]\", an unforgivable crime to the proud Romans. Several times Antony was summoned to Rome, but remained in Alexandria with Cleopatra.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Romans From Village to Empire|last = Boatwright|first = Mary|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199735075|location = New York|pages = 269\u201371}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Donations of Alexandria 34BC.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[map]] of the ''[[Donations of Alexandria]]'' (by Mark Antony to Cleopatra and her children) in 34 BC.\n{{legend|#81EE5B|Unallotted Roman territory}}{{legend|#27c600|Donations to Cleopatra's Children}}{{legend|#1a8000|Cleopatra's Original Kingdom}}]]\n\nAgain with Egyptian money, Antony invaded Armenia, this time successfully. In the return, a mock [[Roman triumph]] was celebrated in the streets of Alexandria. The parade through the city was a [[pastiche]] of Rome's most important military celebration. For the finale, the whole city was summoned to hear a very important political statement. Surrounded by Cleopatra and her children, Antony ended his alliance with Octavian.\n\nHe distributed kingdoms among his children: [[Alexander Helios]] was named king of [[Armenia]], [[Medes|Media]] and [[Parthia]] (territories which were not for the most part under the control of Rome), his twin [[Cleopatra Selene II|Cleopatra Selene]] got [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]], and the young [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] was awarded Syria and [[Cilicia]]. As for Cleopatra, she was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with [[Caesarion]] (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of Cleopatra by Julius Caesar), King of Kings and King of Egypt. Most important of all, Caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of Caesar. These proclamations were known as the ''[[Donations of Alexandria]]'' and caused a fatal breach in Antony's relations with Rome.\n\nWhile the distribution of nations among Cleopatra's children was hardly a conciliatory gesture, it did not pose an immediate threat to Octavian's political position. Far more dangerous was the acknowledgment of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Caesar's name. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through [[Adoption in Rome|adoption]], which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions. To see this convenient situation attacked by a child borne by the richest woman in the world was something Octavian could not accept. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not renewed. Another civil war was beginning.\n\nDuring 33 and 32 BC, a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of Rome, with accusations flying between sides. Antony (in Egypt) divorced Octavia and accused Octavian of being a social upstart, of usurping power, and of forging the adoption papers by Caesar. Octavian responded with treason charges: of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by [[Cleromancy|lots]], as was Rome's tradition, and of starting wars against foreign nations (Armenia and Parthia) without the consent of the Senate.\n\nAntony was also held responsible for [[Sextus Pompey]]'s execution without a trial. In 32 BC, the Senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra \u2013 not Antony, because Octavian had no wish to advertise his role in perpetuating Rome's internecine bloodshed. Both consuls, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and [[Gaius Sosius]], and a third of the Senate abandoned Rome to meet Antony and Cleopatra in Greece.\n\n[[Image:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Actium'' (1672) by [[Laureys a Castro]] ([[National Maritime Museum]], London)]]\nIn 31 BC, the war started. Octavian's general [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] captured the Greek city and naval port of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methone]], loyal to Antony. The enormous popularity of Octavian with the legions secured the defection of the provinces of Cyrenaica and Greece to his side. On September 2, the naval [[Battle of Actium]] took place. Antony and Cleopatra's navy was overwhelmed, and they were forced to escape to Egypt with 60 ships.\n\n===Death===\n{{main|Death of Cleopatra}}\n{{further|Epaphroditus (freedman of Augustus)|Tomb of Antony and Cleopatra}}\n[[File:Venus and Cupid from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII.jpg|thumb|250px|This mid-1st-century-BC [[Pompeian Styles|Roman wall painting]] in [[Pompeii]], Italy, showing [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] holding a [[cupid]] is most likely a depiction of [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as [[Venus Genetrix]], with her son [[Caesarion]] as the cupid, similar in appearance to the now lost statue of Cleopatra erected by [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]] (within the [[Forum of Caesar]]). The owner of the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii walled off the room with this painting, most likely in immediate reaction to the execution of Caesarion on orders of [[Augustus]] in 30 BC, when artistic depictions of Caesarion would have been considered [[Damnatio memoriae|a sensitive issue]] for the ruling regime.<ref>Roller (2010), 175.</ref><ref>Walker (2008), 35, 42\u201344.</ref>]]\n\nOctavian, now close to absolute power, did not intend to give Antony and Cleopatra any rest. In August 30 BC, assisted by Agrippa, he invaded Egypt. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony committed suicide by stabbing himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so. When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monument in which she was hiding, and he died in her arms.\n\nCleopatra was allowed to conduct Antony's burial rites after she had been captured by Octavian. Realising that she was destined for Octavian's [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in Rome, she made several attempts to take her life and finally succeeded in mid-August. Octavian had Caesarion murdered, but he spared Antony's children by Cleopatra, who were paraded through the streets of Rome. Antony's daughters by Octavia were spared, as was his son, [[Iullus Antonius]].  But his elder son, [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]], was killed by Octavian's men while pleading for his life in the [[Caesareum]].\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n\n[[Cicero]]'s son, [[Cicero Minor]], announced Antony's death to the senate.<ref>Dio 51.19.4.</ref> Antony's honours were revoked and his statues removed,<ref>Plut. ''Ant.'' 49.4; Dio 51.19.3.</ref> but he was not subject to a complete [[damnatio memoriae]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Akert|first1=Nick|title=Antony, Augustus, and Damnatio Memoriae|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=discentesjournal|website=University of Pennsylvania|publisher=Discentes|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> Cicero Minor also made a decree that no member of the [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]] would ever bear the name [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]] again.<ref>Plut. ''Ant.'' 49.4; Dio 51.19.4.</ref> \"In this way Heaven entrusted the family of Cicero the final acts in the punishment of Antony.\"<ref>Plut. ''Ant.'' 49.4.</ref>\n\nWhen Antony died, Octavian became uncontested ruler of Rome. In the following years, Octavian, who was known as [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] after 27 BC, managed to accumulate in his person all administrative, political, and military offices. When Augustus died in AD 14, his political powers passed to his adopted son [[Tiberius]]; the [[Roman Empire]] had begun.\n\nThe rise of Caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the Roman [[oligarchy]] as a governing power and ensured that all future power struggles would centre upon which one individual would achieve supreme control of the government, eliminating the Senate and the former magisterial structure as important foci of power in these conflicts. Thus, in history, Antony appears as one of Caesar's main adherents, he and Octavian Augustus being the two men around whom power coalesced following the assassination of Caesar, and finally as one of the three men chiefly responsible for the demise of the [[Roman Republic]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Romans From Village to Empire|last = Boatwright|first = Mary|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199730575|location = New York|pages = 269\u201379}}</ref>\n\n==Marriages and issue==\n[[File:1448 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Octavia, ca. 30 BC - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Fragmentary [[Roman portraiture|portrait bust]] from [[Smyrna]] thought to depict Octavia, sister of Octavian and Antony's wife]]\n[[File:Antiochia (forse), tetradracma di cleopatra VII e marcantonio, 36 ac ca.JPG|thumb|A [[tetradrachm]] of Marcus Antonius and [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]]]\nAntony was known to have an obsession with women, and sex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historycollection.co/really-romes-womanizer-chief-5-interesting-facts-mark-antony/|title=5 Fascinating Facts About Mark Antony|date=2017-02-28|website=HistoryCollection.co|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Mark_Antony/|title=Mark Antony|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ancient.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/who-were-antonys-wives-119726|title=How Many Wives Did Mark Anthony Have?|last=classics|first=N.

Organizers called the demonstrators the \"Bonus Expeditionary Force\", to echo the name of World War I's [[American Expeditionary Forces]], while the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant.\n\nMany of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. The [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1948. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.\n\nOn July 28, [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[William D. Mitchell]] ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President [[Herbert Hoover]] then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General [[Douglas MacArthur]] commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned. \n \nA second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] at [[Fort Hunt, Virginia]], which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home.<ref>\"'Take Job in the Forest or Go Home' Is Alternative Given to Bonus Boys\", ''Middlesboro (Kentucky) Daily News'', May 17, 1933, p1; \"Bonus Marchers Weaken; Accept Jobs in Ax Corps\", ''Milwaukee Journal'', May 20, 1933, p1</ref> In 1936, Congress overrode President Roosevelt's veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bonus army on Capitol lawn cph.3a00515.jpg|thumb|Members of the Bonus Army camped out on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol building]]\nThe practice of war-time military bonuses began in 1776, as payment for the difference between what a soldier earned and what he could have earned had he not enlisted. The practice derived from British legislation passed in the 1592\u201393 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers. Similar legislation for disabled veterans later only progressively passed by the North American colonies, beginning with Virginia in 1624.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}\n\nIn 1781, most of the [[Continental Army]] was [[Demobilization|demobilized]]. Two years later, hundreds of [[Pennsylvania]] war veterans [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|marched on Philadelphia]], then the nation's capital, surrounded the State House, where the [[U.S. Congress]] was in session, and demanded back pay. Congress fled to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and several weeks later, the [[U.S. Army]] expelled the war veterans from Philadelphia.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn August 1776, Congress adopted the first national pension law providing half pay for life for disabled veterans. Considerable pressure was applied to expand benefits to match the British system for serving soldiers and sailors but had little support from the colonial government until mass desertions at the [[Battle of Valley Forge]] that threatened the existence of the [[Continental Army]] led [[George Washington]] to become a strong advocate. Congress progressively passed legislation from 1788 covering pensions and bonuses, eventually extending eligibility to widows in 1836.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graves|first1=Will|title=Pension Acts An Overview of Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty Land Legislation and the Southern Campaigns Pension Transcription Project|url=http://revwarapps.org/revwar-pension-acts.htm|website=Southern Campaigns Revolutionary War Pension Statements & Rosters|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore World War I, the soldiers' military service bonus (adjusted for rank) was land and money; a Continental Army private received {{convert|100|acre|ha}} and $80.00 (2017: $1,968.51) at war's end, while a major general received {{convert|1100|acre|ha}}. In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, {{convert|73500000|acre|ha}} had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program's abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}} Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] did not receive a bonus and after [[World War I]], that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus.

Organizers called the demonstrators the \"Bonus Expeditionary Force\", to echo the name of World War I's [[American Expeditionary Forces]], while the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant.\n\nMany of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. The [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1948. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.\n\nOn July 28, [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[William D. Mitchell]] ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President [[Herbert Hoover]] then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General [[Douglas MacArthur]] commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned. \n \nA second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] at [[Fort Hunt, Virginia]], which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home.<ref>\"'Take Job in the Forest or Go Home' Is Alternative Given to Bonus Boys\", ''Middlesboro (Kentucky) Daily News'', May 17, 1933, p1; \"Bonus Marchers Weaken; Accept Jobs in Ax Corps\", ''Milwaukee Journal'', May 20, 1933, p1</ref> In 1936, Congress overrode President Roosevelt's veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bonus army on Capitol lawn cph.3a00515.jpg|thumb|Members of the Bonus Army camped out on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol building]]\nThe practice of war-time military bonuses began in 1776, as payment for the difference between what a soldier earned and what he could have earned had he not enlisted. The practice derived from British legislation passed in the 1592\u201393 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers.

In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, {{convert|73500000|acre|ha}} had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program's abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}} Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] did not receive a bonus and after [[World War I]], that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus.

Larry decides after finishing the job for Chesty that he has bigger plans in his future and demands a raise. Chesty decides to put Larry on the D and E (Discipline and Execute) squad to scare his rival Biggie Gaines (Bernard Fein), Larry finds this not suited to his goals and knocks out Bo (Bayens Barron), Chesty's enforcer and head of the D and E, Chesty after this makes Larry head of the D and E squad and gives him a machine gun also known as a music box. Larry begins his reign by terrorizing the streets of New York this makes Chesty unhappy as his activities are being noticed by the media and the public is beginning to have a negative view of his gang until his rival \"The Bug\" (uncredited) calls and tells Chesty he will stay out of his way because he doesn't like the sound of that music box, earning Larry the nickname The Music Box Kid<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Music-Box-Kid-Ronald-Foster/dp/B009UBLCZW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+music+box+kid&qid=1569015945&s=instant-video&sr=1-1 The Music Box Kid Film]</ref>. \n\nAfter a short narration on the Prohibition, Larry is seen by a witness and is called in to see the District Attorney. Chesty provides Larry with a lawyer and this allows Larry to get away with no proof of his involvement as the witness says he can't be sure. Father Gorman after hearing about the gang activity in the newspapers goes to check on Margaret Shaw concerned with her well being, as he suspects her husband Larry of being a gangster. Margaret learns that her husband a gangster and that is why they can afford their lifestyle; she becomes terrified for her life. Later that night Larry calls a meeting of his most trusted accomplices and forms the Larry Shaw Enterprises gang, all while Margaret is listening in the kitchen. Larry's first business deal is with his former boss Chesty, he pitches a contract deal which would leave Chesty's gang blameless. Larry's gang becomes successful in dealing contracts to each of the gangs and as Larry becomes delirious with the power he kidnaps Biggie Gaines right-hand man Pat Lamont (Carl Milletaire) and asks for a ransom. Tension increases as Larry and his gang continue to hit the other gangs where it hurts and at the same time tension between Larry and Margaret increase as Father Gorman tries to convince Margaret to tell everything she knows about Larry and his gang to George Gordon(Carlton Young) the new chief hired to catch Larry and the other gangsters. Margaret refuses then later overhears Larry's plan to kill George Gordon and offer it as a contract to all the gang leaders for $1 million. Margaret thinking of her unborn child calls Father Gorman after Larry and his gang leave and relays the plan to Father Gorman. The next scene Larry is killed by a policeman in the scuffle and the film ends showing the fate of Margaret and Larry's son, who chose to become a Priest.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1960]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0054103}}\n\n\n{{Edward L.

Soon afterwords, Kane ruffles the feathers of Barnes racketeering outfit by banging up the cabs of his stooges. Then Kane is offered a job by Barnes for almost ten times the money to get him off their backs.

Kane declines the offer, but not before using Barnes' own war wagon to smash up his garage. Barnes girlfriend, Sybil, then tries to persuade Kane to reconsider the offer, but gets upstaged when an inept Barnes driver using the armored car to harass a fellow driver known to Kane botches the job and the other driver ends up dying from the hit and run gone wrong.
