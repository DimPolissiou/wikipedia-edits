The [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] counted a population of 6,606. With the surrounding area, the population is about 28,000. The population served by the Sequim School District population was close to 29,000 in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sequimschools.org/|title=Sequim School District - About US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012836/http://sequimschools.org/|archive-date=2018-01-26|url-status=live|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref> Sequim is located along the [[Dungeness River]] near the base of the [[Olympic Mountains]]. \n\nSequim lies within the [[rain shadow]] of the Olympic Mountains and receives on average less than {{convert|16|in|mm}} of rain per year \u2013 about the same as [[Los Angeles, California]] \u2013 leading it to give itself the nickname of ''Sunny Sequim''. However, the city is relatively close to some of the wettest [[temperate rainforest]]s of the [[contiguous United States]]. This climate anomaly is sometimes called the \"Blue Hole of Sequim\".<ref name=mass>{{cite book |last= Mass |first= Cliff |title= The Weather of the Pacific Northwest |year= 2008 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 978-0-295-98847-4 |page= 194}}</ref> Fogs and cool breezes from the [[Juan de Fuca Strait]] make Sequim's climate more humid than would be expected from the low average annual precipitation. Some places have surprisingly luxuriant forests dominated by [[Douglas-fir]] and [[western red cedar]]. [[Black cottonwood]], [[red alder]], [[bigleaf maple]], [[Pacific madrone]], [[lodgepole pine]], and [[Garry oak]] can also be large. Historically, much of the area was an open oak-studded prairie supported by somewhat excessively drained gravelly sandy loam soil, though agriculture and development of the Dungeness valley have changed this ecosystem. Most soils under Sequim have been placed in a series that is named after the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx|title=Web Soil Survey|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302004416/http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-02}}</ref> This \"Sequim series\" is one of the few [[Mollisol]]s in western Washington and its high [[base saturation]], a characteristic of the Mollisol order, is attributed to the minimal leaching of bases caused by low annual rainfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/S/SEQUIM.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117203412/http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/S/SEQUIM.html |archivedate=2009-11-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe city and the surrounding area are particularly known for the commercial cultivation of [[lavender]], supported by the unique climate. It makes Sequim the \"Lavender Capital of North America\", rivaled only in France. The area is also known for its [[Dungeness crab]].\n\nSequim is pronounced as one syllable, with the ''e'' elided: \"skwim\". The name developed from the [[Klallam]] language.\n\n== History ==\n=== Aboriginal inhabitants ===\nFossils discovered in the late 1970s at a dig near Sequim \u2013 by Carl Gustafson, an archaeologist at [[Washington State University]] \u2013 known as the [[Manis Mastodon Site]] included a [[mastodon]] bone with an embedded bone point, evidencing the presence of hunters in the area about 14,000 years ago. According to Michael R. Waters, an archaeologist at [[Texas A&M University]], this is the first hunting weapon found that dates to the pre-[[Clovis culture|Clovis]] period.\n\nThe [[Klallam|S'Klallam]] tribe had inhabited the region prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. S'Klallam means  \"the strong people\".  The band of S'Klallam Indians disbanded into their own individual federally recognized tribes in the early 1900s.  The local tribe is the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe, named after one of their early leaders, Lord James Balch. According to other tales, the town Sequim in S'Klallam means \"a place for going to shoot\", which represents the abundance of game and wildlife of the area.<ref>{{cite news|title='Quiet water'?

The first European settlers arrived in the Dungeness Valley in the 1850s, settling nearby [[Dungeness, Washington]]. While the lands along the river became fertile farmlands, the remainder of the area remained arid prairie, known as \"the desert\".<ref name=mass /> Irrigation canals first brought water to the prairie in the 1890s, allowing the expansion of farmlands.\n\nSequim was officially incorporated on October 31, 1913. For many decades small farms, mostly dairy farms, dotted the area around the small town. Near the end of World War I, Sequim became a stop for a railway that passed through from [[Port Angeles]] to [[Port Townsend]], built primarily to carry wood products from the forests of the western [[Olympic Peninsula]].\n\n==Culture==\n\nSequim holds an Irrigation Festival every May. {{As of|2019}}, it is the longest continually running festival in the state and is in its 124th year.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sequimgazette.com/news/article.exm/2012-05-02_irrigation_festival_splashes_into_opening_weekend | title=Irrigation Festival splashes into opening weekend | work=Sequim Gazette | date=May 2, 2012 | accessdate=June 8, 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505024825/http://sequimgazette.com/news/article.exm/2012-05-02_irrigation_festival_splashes_into_opening_weekend | archivedate=May 5, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irrigationfestival.com/|title=Sequim Irrigation Festival|last=|first=|date=|website=Sequim Irrigation Festival|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Tourist attractions ===\n[[File:SimplifiedPealeMastodon.jpg|thumb|150px|Drawing of a mastodon skeleton by [[Rembrandt Peale]]]]\n*Sequim is home to a herd of [[Roosevelt elk]].

However, the city is relatively close to some of the wettest [[temperate rainforest]]s of the [[contiguous United States]]. This climate anomaly is sometimes called the \"Blue Hole of Sequim\".<ref name=mass>{{cite book |last= Mass |first= Cliff |title= The Weather of the Pacific Northwest |year= 2008 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 978-0-295-98847-4 |page= 194}}</ref> Fogs and cool breezes from the [[Juan de Fuca Strait]] make Sequim's climate more humid than would be expected from the low average annual precipitation. Some places have surprisingly luxuriant forests dominated by [[Douglas-fir]] and [[western red cedar]]. [[Black cottonwood]], [[red alder]], [[bigleaf maple]], [[Pacific madrone]], [[lodgepole pine]], and [[Garry oak]] can also be large. Historically, much of the area was an open oak-studded prairie supported by somewhat excessively drained gravelly sandy loam soil, though agriculture and development of the Dungeness valley have changed this ecosystem. Most soils under Sequim have been placed in a series that is named after the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx|title=Web Soil Survey|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302004416/http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-02}}</ref> This \"Sequim series\" is one of the few [[Mollisol]]s in western Washington and its high [[base saturation]], a characteristic of the Mollisol order, is attributed to the minimal leaching of bases caused by low annual rainfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/S/SEQUIM.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117203412/http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/S/SEQUIM.html |archivedate=2009-11-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe city and the surrounding area are particularly known for the commercial cultivation of [[lavender]], supported by the unique climate. It makes Sequim the \"Lavender Capital of North America\", rivaled only in France. The area is also known for its [[Dungeness crab]].\n\nSequim is pronounced as one syllable, with the ''e'' elided: \"skwim\". The name developed from the [[Klallam]] language.\n\n== History ==\n=== Aboriginal inhabitants ===\nFossils discovered in the late 1970s at a dig near Sequim \u2013 by Carl Gustafson, an archaeologist at [[Washington State University]] \u2013 known as the [[Manis Mastodon Site]] included a [[mastodon]] bone with an embedded bone point, evidencing the presence of hunters in the area about 14,000 years ago. According to Michael R. Waters, an archaeologist at [[Texas A&M University]], this is the first hunting weapon found that dates to the pre-[[Clovis culture|Clovis]] period.\n\nThe [[Klallam|S'Klallam]] tribe had inhabited the region prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. S'Klallam means  \"the strong people\".  The band of S'Klallam Indians disbanded into their own individual federally recognized tribes in the early 1900s.  The local tribe is the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe, named after one of their early leaders, Lord James Balch. According to other tales, the town Sequim in S'Klallam means \"a place for going to shoot\", which represents the abundance of game and wildlife of the area.<ref>{{cite news|title='Quiet waters'?

The first European settlers arrived in the Dungeness Valley in the 1850s, settling nearby [[Dungeness, Washington]]. While the lands along the river became fertile farmlands, the remainder of the area remained arid prairie, known as \"the desert\".<ref name=mass /> Irrigation canals first brought water to the prairie in the 1890s, allowing the expansion of farmlands.\n\nSequim was officially incorporated on October 31, 1913. For many decades small farms, mostly dairy farms, dotted the area around the small town. Near the end of World War I, Sequim became a stop for a railway that passed through from [[Port Angeles]] to [[Port Townsend]], built primarily to carry wood products from the forests of the western [[Olympic Peninsula]].\n\n==Culture==\n\nSequim holds an Irrigation Festival every May. {{As of|2019}}, it is the longest continually running festival in the state and is in its 124th year.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sequimgazette.com/news/article.exm/2012-05-02_irrigation_festival_splashes_into_opening_weekend | title=Irrigation Festival splashes into opening weekend | work=Sequim Gazette | date=May 2, 2012 | accessdate=June 8, 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505024825/http://sequimgazette.com/news/article.exm/2012-05-02_irrigation_festival_splashes_into_opening_weekend | archivedate=May 5, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irrigationfestival.com/|title=Sequim Irrigation Festival|last=|first=|date=|website=Sequim Irrigation Festival|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Tourist attractions ===\n[[File:SimplifiedPealeMastodon.jpg|thumb|150px|Drawing of a mastodon skeleton by [[Rembrandt Peale]]]]\n*Sequim is home to a herd of [[Roosevelt elk]].

When providing support for amphibious operations, ''Wave Ruler'' is also able to deliver fuel to [[Dracone Barge|dracones]] positioned alongside. In addition to fuel, the ship carries ammunition and other stores which can be transferred while underway.

On 2 November the ship and its accompanying [[Royal Marines]] captured 3 tonnes of cocaine worth \u00a3300m. On 29 November it seized a further 2.9 tonnes, again from a fishing boat.

In each episode the Grump flew a dragon named Dingo, chasing Terry and Princess Dawn. This led them to bizarre places with strange characters, such as the Blabbermouth of Echo Island, where the mountains were made of living Swiss cheese.\n\nThe Princess had a pet named Bip \u2014 a vaguely doglike creature with tentacular legs, that sniffed clues like a hound dog, turned around by pulling in its tail and head and popping them back out at opposite ends, and communicated in the sounds of a soprano bugle. In most episodes, the Princess and her friends traveled in a flying car supported by a big balloon.\n\nA recurring gag was that at the very last minute when the Grump was about to catch up with Princess Dawn, the Dragon would sneeze and burn the little wizard.\n\nThe character of the Grump was based upon [[Yosemite Sam|Old Town Road in Chuck Jones style]], also created by [[Friz Freleng]].  The Grump's Dragon was similar to Sam's in \"[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]\", right down to the fiery nasal explosions upon its master.\n\nIn what is planned to be the series finale of the series, a gentle giantess style cadence kenyon now codenamed [[Super Milk Chan|Little Milk Bloop]], taking a [[The Banana Splits|flock of four flying and singing animals]], took terry and dawn riding, and realized that they were finally in the cave of the whispering orchids. The balloon soon lands down on her back at the cave entrance. Dawn told the orchids where the crystal key was, but they were not listening. It seemed like the static bloop stood dead silent the soulless flock murmured trying to get them to respond, but they blooped out. terry and dawn were stuck like paintings and her father\u2019s kingdom was one big dump. Cadence realized that this was a dream from last night. It seemed like cadence ate the crystal key in order to save her father\u2019s kingdom. The flock was flooping up, but then something happened, her father\u2019s kingdom was restored to its new glory. The gentle giantess sang a more modern style of [[The Phantom Tollbooth|rhyme and reason reign]], the happy flock celebrated, the grump was taken to jail, Dex was sent back home, and Princess Dawn was codenamed the new queen by the gentle bloop.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series was broadcast by [[NBC]] from September 6, 1969 to December 27, 1969. NBC continued to air reruns until December 28, 1970.\n\nThe series lasted one season and was rerun, the most recent airing was on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the mid 1990s. The complete series was released on DVD on January 31, 2006.\n\nThe series was called ''Ahi viene cascarrabias'' in Spanish and was in retransmitted into the 1970s and 1980s by [[Televisa]] and another rerun in 2006 after the DVD set was launched. It was \"Grump, o feiticeiro trapalh\u00e3o\" in Brazilian Portuguese and was in retransmitted until 1993 by [[Rede Globo]].\n\nThe only known merchandise for the show was a \"Here Comes the Grump\" Halloween mask, produced by the Ben Cooper Costume Company, for the 1969 holiday season.\n\n==Episode guide==\nThere were 17 episodes, each containing two ten-minute shorts, giving a total of 34 separate cartoons.\n\n# The Bloonywoonie Battle   (First aired: 9/6/1969)\n# The Great Grump Crunch  (First aired: 9/13/1969)\n# The Great Thorn Forest  (First aired: 9/20/1969)\n# The Eenie Meenie Miners  (First aired: 9/27/1969)\n# The Good Ghost Ship  (First aired: 10/4/1969)\n# Grump Meets Peter Paintbrush  (First aired: 10/11/1969)\n# The Lemonade Sea  (First aired: 10/18/1969)\n# Beware of Giants  (First aired: 10/25/1969)\n# Joltin' Jack-In Boxia  (First aired: 11/1/1969)\n# Visit to a Ghost Town  (First aired: 11/8/1969)\n# A Mess for King Midix  (First aired: 11/15/1969)\n# The Shoes of Shoe-Cago  (First aired: 11/22/1969)\n# Witch Is Witch?

In each episode the Grump flew a dragon named Dingo, chasing Terry and Princess Dawn. This led them to bizarre places with strange characters, such as the Blabbermouth of Echo Island, where the mountains were made of living Swiss cheese.\n\nThe Princess had a pet named Bip \u2014 a vaguely doglike creature with tentacular legs, that sniffed clues like a hound dog, turned around by pulling in its tail and head and popping them back out at opposite ends, and communicated in the sounds of a soprano bugle. In most episodes, the Princess and her friends traveled in a flying car supported by a big balloon.\n\nA recurring gag was that at the very last minute when the Grump was about to catch up with Princess Dawn, the Dragon would sneeze and burn the little wizard.\n\nThe character of the Grump was based upon [[Yosemite Sam]], also created by [[Friz Freleng]].  The Grump's Dragon was similar to Sam's in \"[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]\", right down to the fiery nasal explosions upon its master.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series was broadcast by [[NBC]] from September 6, 1969 to December 27, 1969. NBC continued to air reruns until December 28, 1970.\n\nThe series lasted one season and was rerun, the most recent airing was on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the mid 1990s. The complete series was released on DVD on January 31, 2006.\n\nThe series was called ''Ahi viene cascarrabias'' in Spanish and was in retransmitted into the 1970s and 1980s by [[Televisa]] and another rerun in 2006 after the DVD set was launched. It was \"Grump, o feiticeiro trapalh\u00e3o\" in Brazilian Portuguese and was in retransmitted until 1993 by [[Rede Globo]].\n\nThe only known merchandise for the show was a \"Here Comes the Grump\" Halloween mask, produced by the Ben Cooper Costume Company, for the 1969 holiday season.\n\n==Episode guide==\nThere were 17 episodes, each containing two ten-minute shorts, giving a total of 34 separate cartoons.\n\n# The Bloonywoonie Battle   (First aired: 9/6/1969)\n# The Great Grump Crunch  (First aired: 9/13/1969)\n# The Great Thorn Forest  (First aired: 9/20/1969)\n# The Eenie Meenie Miners  (First aired: 9/27/1969)\n# The Good Ghost Ship  (First aired: 10/4/1969)\n# Grump Meets Peter Paintbrush  (First aired: 10/11/1969)\n# The Lemonade Sea  (First aired: 10/18/1969)\n# Beware of Giants  (First aired: 10/25/1969)\n# Joltin' Jack-In Boxia  (First aired: 11/1/1969)\n# Visit to a Ghost Town  (First aired: 11/8/1969)\n# A Mess for King Midix  (First aired: 11/15/1969)\n# The Shoes of Shoe-Cago  (First aired: 11/22/1969)\n# Witch Is Witch?
