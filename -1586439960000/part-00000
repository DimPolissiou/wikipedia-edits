Deville formed a new band in 1995 and decided to continue using the Nosferatu name without authorisation.

Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother [[Damon Salvatore]] ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) returns, with a plan to bring back their past love Katherine Pierce (also played by Dobrev), a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. Although Damon initially harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three.

Although Damon initially harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine.

The chorus of the song appears at 1:04, with the song's title sung. The song then switches between a [[Verse (popular music)|verse]] and the [[refrain]]. A short electric guitar [[solo (music)|solo]] appears at 1:53 and at 2:10 the horn fanfare re-enters. The song closes with fading vocals of McCartney, much akin to the soul records of the time.

So [it's] really a song about that, it's not to a person.\"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=190}} Many lyrics from the song suggest this: \"I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there / Another road where maybe I could see some other kind of mind there.\",'\"What can I do? What can I be? When I'm with you, I want to stay there / If I am true, I will never leave and if I do, I'll know the way there.\" \"It's actually an ode to pot,\" McCartney explained, \"like someone else might write an ode to chocolate or a good claret.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/got-to-get-you-into-my-life-19691231|title=100 Greatest Beatles Songs: #50 \u2013 'Got to Get You Into My Life'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[Parlophone]] released ''Revolver'' on 5 August 1966 with \"Got to Get You into My Life\" sequenced as the penultimate track,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=84}} between Harrison's \"[[I Want to Tell You]]\" and Lennon's \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=239\u201340}} According to Devin McKinney, while McCartney's songs can be heard individually as \"simple affirmations\", in the context of their placement on ''Revolver'', \"each song gains\" from the reflected depth of the Lennon and Harrison compositions.

The chorus of the song appears at 1:04, with the song's title sung. The song then switches between a [[Verse (popular music)|verse]] and the [[refrain]]. A short electric guitar [[solo (music)|solo]] appears at 1:53 and at 2:10 the horn fanfare re-enters. The song closes with fading vocals of McCartney, much akin to the soul records of the time.

McKinney writes that \"Got to Get You into My Life\" \"is notable for being as expressive of a simple livid frustration as any McCartney music to date: its two minutes are a tight mass of constipated fury, an existential annoyance expressing itself as romantic confusion\".{{sfn|McKinney|2003|p=139}}\n\nIn his review of the song for [[AllMusic]], Thomas Ward writes: \"McCartney's always been a great vocalist, and this is perhaps the best example of his singing on ''Revolver''.

The office moved to The Crescent, [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in 1946 after [[World War Two]]. The firm was strongly established as a family business and by the time the company celebrated is Centenary in 1968, Rains' three great-grandchildren were partners in the firm. Michael Gass joined the company as a fourth partner and at this point Samuel Rains and Sons boasted a chain of five branches. By the time of the merger with Reeds, the company operated twenty five branches.<ref name=\"YouChoob\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGODVrC9ic] The History of Reeds Rains - Youtube.</ref>\n\nThe firm of Reeds had its roots in a firm established in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in 1870 by a George Wrightson. After his death in 1890, his assistant Edward Reed took over the business. As with Samuel Rains and Sons, the company was a family business and after the [[World War One]], Harold and George Reed (Edward's sons) joined the company. They sold the firm to Basil Crosley in 1956 and by 1972 Crosley had expanded the business to comprise four partners including his own son John. The name of the company was changed to Reeds and further branches were acquired through a merger with the firm of Petty and Co in 1976. By the time of their merger with Samuel Rains and Sons, Reeds operated sixteen branches.<ref name=\"YouChoob\" />\n\nThe two firms merged in 1982 and the large logistical task of renaming the offices and replacing over five hundred for sale boards was complete within two weeks.

Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Anne Boleyn served Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour served both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard served Anne of Cleves.\n\n==Catherine of Aragon==\n{{Main|Catherine of Aragon}}\n[[File:Catalina de Arag\u00f3n, por un artista an\u00f3nimo.jpg|right|thumb|Catherine of Aragon]]\n[[Catherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Arag\u00f3n}}) was Henry's first wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-16858-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 48] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  In modern sources her name is most commonly spelled ''Catherine'', although she spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was an accepted spelling in England at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}</ref> After the death in 1502 of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until he came to the throne in 1509. Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.<ref>Jokinen, Anniina. \"[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]\" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I

Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Anne Boleyn served Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour served both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard served Anne of Cleves.\n\n==Catherine of Aragon==\n{{Main|Catherine of Aragon}}\n[[File:Catalina de Arag\u00f3n, por un artista an\u00f3nimo.jpg|right|thumb|Catherine of Aragon]]\n[[Catherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Arag\u00f3n}}) was Henry's first wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-16858-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 48] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  In modern sources her name is most commonly spelled ''Catherine'', although she spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was an accepted spelling in England at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}</ref> After the death in 1502 of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until he came to the throne in 1509. Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife.

Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I
