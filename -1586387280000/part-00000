Some instances are examples of widespread [[internet censorship]] in general that includes [[Wikipedia]] content. Others are indicative of measures to prevent the viewing of specific content deemed offensive. The length of different blocks have varied from days to years. When Wikipedia ran on the [[HTTP]] protocol, governments were able to block specific articles. However, in 2011 Wikipedia began running on [[HTTPS]] as well, and in 2015 switched over entirely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2017/04/WikipediaCensorship|title=Analyzing Accessibility of Wikipedia Projects Around the World|last=Clark|first=Justin|last2=Faris|first2=Robert|date=2017|website=Berkman Klein Center|language=en|access-date=20 September 2018|last3=Heacock Jones|first3=Rebekah|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920131348/https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2017/04/WikipediaCensorship|archive-date=20 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, the only censorship option has been to block the entire site for a particular language, which has resulted in some countries dropping their bans and others expanding their bans to the entire site.

It was discovered at the same time as [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and named after a character in [[Alexander Pope]]'s poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Umbriel consists mainly of [[ice]] with a substantial fraction of [[rock (geology)|rock]], and may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] and an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\n\nCovered by numerous [[impact crater]]s reaching {{convert|210|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, Umbriel is the second most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]] crater. This moon, like all moons of Uranus, probably formed from an [[accretion disk]] that surrounded the planet just after its formation. The Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft ''[[Voyager 2]]'' in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon's surface.\n\n== Discovery and name ==\nUmbriel, along with another Uranian satellite, [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], was discovered by [[William Lassell]] on October 24, 1851.<ref name=\"Lassell 1851\" /><ref name=\"Lassell, letter 1851\" /> Although [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], claimed at the end of the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus,<ref name=\"Herschel 1798\" /> his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.<ref name=\"Struve 1848\" />\n\nAll of Uranus's moons are named after characters created by [[William Shakespeare]] or [[Alexander Pope]]. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by [[John Herschel]] in 1852 at the request of Lassell.<ref name=\"Lassell 1852\" /> Umbriel is the \"dusky melancholy sprite\" in Alexander Pope's ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'',<ref name=\"Kuiper 1949\" /> and the name suggests the [[Latin]] ''[[umbra]]'', meaning ''shadow''. <!--The adjectival form of the name is ''Umbrielian''.--> The moon is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;II'''.<ref name=\"Lassell, letter 1851\" />\n\n== Orbit ==\nUmbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about {{convert|266000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, being the third farthest from the planet among its [[moons of Uranus|five major moons]].{{efn|The five major moons are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], Umbriel, Titania and Oberon.}} Umbriel's orbit has a small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] very little relative to the [[equator]] of Uranus.<ref name=\"orbit\" /> Its [[orbital period]] is around 4.1&nbsp;Earth days, coincident with its [[rotational period]]. In other words, Umbriel is a [[synchronous orbit|synchronous]] or [[tidally locked]] satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the [[Magnetosphere of Uranus|Uranian magnetosphere]].<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> This is important, because the trailing [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]] of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which co-rotates with the planet.<ref name=\"Ness Acu\u00f1a et al. 1986\" /> This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]] (see below).<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by ''Voyager 2'' in 1986.<ref name=\"Krimigis Armstrong et al. 1986\" />\n\nBecause Uranus orbits the [[Sun]] almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's equatorial plane, they (including Umbriel) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Geographic poles|poles]] spend 42 years in complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the Sun rising close to the [[zenith]] over one of the poles at each [[solstice]].<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The ''Voyager 2'' flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was unilluminated. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an [[equinox]] and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual [[occultation]]s of Uranus's moons become possible. In 2007\u20132008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007 as well as of Ariel by Umbriel on August 19, 2007.<ref name=\"Miller Chanover 2009\" /><ref name=\"Arlot Dumas et al. 2008\" />\n\nCurrently Umbriel is not involved in any [[orbital resonance]] with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]]. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected.<ref name=\"Tittemore Wisdom 1990\" /> Due to Uranus's lower [[oblate spheroid|oblate]]ness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of [[Jupiter]] or [[Saturn]]. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.<ref name=\"Tittemore Wisdom 1989\" /><ref name=\"Malhotra Dermott 1990\" />\n\n== Composition and internal structure ==\n[[File:Umbriel Earth Moon Comparison.png|thumb|left|250px|Size comparison of [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and Umbriel.]]\n\nUmbriel is the third largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons.{{efn|Due to the current [[observational error]], it is not yet known for certain whether [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] is more massive than Umbriel.<ref name=\"JPLSSD\"/>}} The moon's density is 1.39&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<ref name=\"Jacobson Campbell et al. 1992\"/> which indicates that it mainly consists of [[Ice|water ice]], with a dense non-ice component constituting around 40% of its mass.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\"/> The latter could be made of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[carbon]]aceous material including heavy [[organic compound]]s known as [[tholin]]s.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> The presence of water ice is supported by [[infrared]] [[spectroscopic]] observations, which have revealed [[crystalline]] water ice on the surface of the moon.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> Water ice [[absorption band]]s are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the [[magnetosphere of Uranus]], which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The energetic particles tend to [[sputtering|sputter]] water ice, decompose [[methane]] trapped in ice as [[clathrate hydrate]] and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] behind.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" />\n\nExcept for water, the only other compound identified on the surface of Umbriel by the infrared spectroscopy is [[carbon dioxide]], which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from [[carbonate]]s or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus or the solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the [[outgassing]] of the [[Primordial element|primordial]] CO<sub>2</sub> trapped by water ice in Umbriel's interior. The escape of CO<sub>2</sub> from the interior may be a result of past geological activity on this moon.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" />\n\nUmbriel may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] surrounded by an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> If this is the case, the radius of the core (317&nbsp;km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon's mass\u2014the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure in the center of Umbriel is about 0.24&nbsp;[[GPa]] (2.4&nbsp;[[kbar]]).<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" />\n\n== Surface features ==\nUmbriel's surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons, and reflects less than half as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size.<ref name=\"JPLSSD\" /> Umbriel has a very low [[Bond albedo]] of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel.<ref name=\"Karkoschka 2001, Hubble\" /> The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0\u00b0 ([[geometric albedo]]) to 19% at an angle of about 1\u00b0. This phenomenon is called [[opposition surge]]. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color,<ref name=\"Bell McCord 1991\" /> while fresh bright impact deposits (in [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]] crater, for instance)<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter.<ref name=\"Buratti Mosher 1991\" /> The reddening of the surfaces probably results from [[space weathering]] from bombardment by charged particles and [[Micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] over the age of the [[Solar System]].<ref name=\"Bell McCord 1991\" /> However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from [[irregular satellite]]s, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.<ref name=\"Buratti Mosher 1991\" /> The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous\u2014it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.<ref name=\"Bell McCord 1991\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+ Named craters on Umbriel<ref name=\"usgs\" />{{efn|name=spirits|Surface features on Umbriel are named for evil or dark spirits taken from various mythologies.<ref name=\"Strobell & Masursky 1987\" />}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Crater\n! scope=\"col\" | Named after\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Coordinates\n! scope=\"col\" | Diameter (km)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Alberich\n| [[Alberich]] ([[Norse mythology|Norse]])\n| {{coord|33.6|S|42.2|E|dim:52.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 52.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Fin\n| [[Fin (troll)|Fin]] ([[Danish folklore|Danish]])\n| {{coord|37.4|S|44.3|E|dim:43.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 43.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gob\n| Gob ([[Paganism|Pagan]])\n| {{coord|12.7|S|27.8|E|dim:88.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 88.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kanaloa\n| [[Kanaloa]] ([[Polynesian mythology|Polynesian]])\n| {{coord|10.8|S|345.7|E|dim:86.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 86.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Malingee\n| Malingee ([[Australian Aboriginal mythology]])\n| {{coord|22.9|S|13.9|E|dim:164.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 164.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Minepa\n| [[Minepa]] ([[Makua (people)|Makua]] people of [[Mozambique]])\n| {{coord|42.7|S|8.2|E|dim:58.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 58.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Peri\n| [[Peri]] ([[Islamic mythology|Persian]])\n| {{coord|9.2|S|4.3|E|dim:61.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 61.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Setibos\n| [[Setebos (Shakespeare)|Setebos]] ([[Patagonia]]n)\n| {{coord|30.8|S|346.3|E|dim:50.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 50.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Skynd (crater)|Skynd]]\n| [[Skynd]] ([[Danish folklore|Danish]])\n| {{coord|1.8|S|331.7|E|dim:72.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 72.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Vuver (crater)|Vuver]]\n| [[Vuver]] ([[Finnish mythology|Finnish]])\n| {{coord|4.7|S|311.6|E|dim:98.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 98.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Wokolo (crater)|Wokolo]]\n| Wokolo ([[Bambara people]] of West Africa)\n| {{coord|30|S|1.8|E|dim:208.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 208.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]]\n| Wunda (Australian Aboriginal mythology)\n| {{coord|7.9|S|273.6|E|dim:131.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 131.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zlyden\n| [[Zlyden]] ([[Slavic mythology|Slavic]])\n| {{coord|23.3|S|326.2|E|dim:44.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 44.0\n|}\n\nScientists have so far recognized only one class of geological feature on Umbriel\u2014[[Impact crater|craters]].<ref name=\"usgs\" /> The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and [[Titania (moon)|Titania]]. It shows the least geological activity.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers at the low end to 210&nbsp;kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /><ref name=\"usgs\" /> All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks,<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> but no crater has [[Ray system|rays]].<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nNear Umbriel's equator lies the most prominent surface feature: Wunda crater, which has a diameter of about 131&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"usgsWunda\" /><ref name=\"hunt\" /> Wunda has a large ring of bright material on its floor, which may be an impact deposit<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> or deposit of carbon dioxide ice.<ref name=Sori2017/> Nearby, seen along the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], are the craters [[Vuver (crater)|Vuver]] and [[Skynd (crater)|Skynd]], which lack bright rims but possess bright central peaks.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /><ref name=\"hunt\" /> Study of limb profiles of Umbriel revealed a possible very large impact feature having the diameter of about 400&nbsp;km and depth of approximately 5&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Moore Schenk et al. 2004\" />\n\nMuch like other moons of Uranus, the surface of Umbriel is cut by a system of canyons trending northeast\u2013southwest.<ref name=\"Croft1989\" /> They are not, however, officially recognized due to the poor imaging resolution and generally bland appearance of this moon, which hinders [[Geologic map|geological mapping]].<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" />\n\nUmbriel's heavily cratered surface has probably been stable since the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons\u2014dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across.<ref name=\"Helfenstein Thomas et al. 1989\" /> The polygons were identified from precise photometry of ''Voyager 2'''s images and are distributed more or less uniformly on the surface of Umbriel, trending northeast\u2013southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity.<ref name=\"Helfenstein Thomas et al. 1989\" /> Currently there is no explanation for why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called ''[[umbra]]l material'') excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption.{{efn|While a co-orbiting population of dust particles is another possible source of the dark material, this is considered less likely because other satellites were not affected.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />}}<ref name=\"Buratti Mosher 1991\" /> Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\n== Origin and evolution ==\n[[File:Umbriel usgsx2.jpg|thumb|Map of Umbriel showing polygons|alt=A spherical blueish body with its surface covered by craters and polygons. The lower right part is smooth.]]\n\nUmbriel is thought to have formed from an [[accretion disc]] or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large [[Axial tilt|obliquity]].<ref name=\"Mousis 2004\" /> The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the [[moons of Saturn]] indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor.{{efn|For instance, [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], a Saturnian moon, has a density of 0.97&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which suggests that over 90% of its composition is water.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" />}}<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> Significant amounts of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] may have been present in the form of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[nitrogen|molecular nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) instead of [[ammonia]] and methane.<ref name=\"Mousis 2004\" /> The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N<sub>2</sub> trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nUmbriel's accretion probably lasted for several thousand years.<ref name=\"Mousis 2004\" /> The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer.<ref name=\"Squyres Reynolds et al. 1988\" /> The maximum temperature of around 180&nbsp;K was reached at the depth of about 3&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Squyres Reynolds et al. 1988\" /> After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Umbriel heated due to decay of [[radioactivity|radioactive elements]] present in its rocks.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong [[Stress (mechanics)|extensional stresses]] in the moon's crust, which may have led to cracking.<ref name=\"Hillier & Squyres 1991\" /> This process probably lasted for about 200&nbsp;million years, implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions of years ago.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nThe initial [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretional heating]] together with continued decay of radioactive elements may have led to melting of the ice<ref name=\"Squyres Reynolds et al. 1988\" /> if an [[antifreeze]] like ammonia (in the form of [[hydrate|ammonia hydrate]]) or some salt was present.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> The melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core\u2013mantle boundary. The [[eutectic temperature]] of this mixture is 176&nbsp;K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes,<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.<ref name=\"Helfenstein Thomas et al. 1989\" />\n\n== Exploration ==\n[[File:Voyager_spacecraft.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The Voyager 2 spacecraft]]\n{{Further|Exploration of Uranus}}\n\nSo far the only close-up images of Umbriel have been from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between ''Voyager 2'' and Umbriel was {{convert|325000|km|mi|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Stone 1987\" /> the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 5.2&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 20% was photographed with the quality required for [[geological mapping]].<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> No other spacecraft has ever visited Uranus or its moons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of natural satellites]]\n{{Portal bar|Astronomy}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notes\n| colwidth = 30em\n| notes =\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth = 30em\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"dict-def\">\n{{MW|Umbriel}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\">\n{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.233.4759.43| last1 = Smith| first1 = B.

It was discovered at the same time as [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and named after a character in [[Alexander Pope]]'s poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Umbriel consists mainly of [[ice]] with a substantial fraction of [[rock (geology)|rock]], and may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] and an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\n\nCovered by numerous [[impact crater]]s reaching {{convert|210|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, Umbriel is the second most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]] crater. This moon, like all moons of Uranus, probably formed from an [[accretion disk]] that surrounded the planet just after its formation. The Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft ''[[Voyager 2]]'' in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon's surface.\n\n== Discovery and name ==\nUmbriel, along with another Uranian satellite, [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], was discovered by [[William Lassell]] on October 24, 1851.<ref name=\"Lassell 1851\" /><ref name=\"Lassell, letter 1851\" /> Although [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], claimed at the end of the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus,<ref name=\"Herschel 1798\" /> his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.<ref name=\"Struve 1848\" />\n\nAll of Uranus's moons are named after characters created by [[William Shakespeare]] or [[Alexander Pope]]. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by [[John Herschel]] in 1852 at the request of Lassell.<ref name=\"Lassell 1852\" /> Umbriel is the \"dusky melancholy sprite\" in Alexander Pope's ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'',<ref name=\"Kuiper 1949\" /> and the name suggests the [[Latin]] ''[[umbra]]'', meaning ''shadow''. <!--The adjectival form of the name is ''Umbrielian''.--> The moon is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;II'''.<ref name=\"Lassell, letter 1851\" />\n\n== Orbit ==\nUmbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about {{convert|266000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, being the third farthest from the planet among its [[moons of Uranus|five major moons]].{{efn|The five major moons are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], Umbriel, Titania and Oberon.}} Umbriel's orbit has a small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] very little relative to the [[equator]] of Uranus.<ref name=\"orbit\" /> Its [[orbital period]] is around 4.1&nbsp;Earth days, coincident with its [[rotational period]]. In other words, Umbriel is a [[synchronous orbit|synchronous]] or [[tidally locked]] satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the [[Magnetosphere of Uranus|Uranian magnetosphere]].<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> This is important, because the trailing [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]] of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which co-rotates with the planet.<ref name=\"Ness Acu\u00f1a et al. 1986\" /> This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]] (see below).<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by ''Voyager 2'' in 1986.<ref name=\"Krimigis Armstrong et al. 1986\" />\n\nBecause Uranus orbits the [[Sun]] almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's equatorial plane, they (including Umbriel) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Geographic poles|poles]] spend 42 years in complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the Sun rising close to the [[zenith]] over one of the poles at each [[solstice]].<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The ''Voyager 2'' flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was unilluminated. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an [[equinox]] and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual [[occultation]]s of Uranus's moons become possible. In 2007\u20132008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007 as well as of Ariel by Umbriel on August 19, 2007.<ref name=\"Miller Chanover 2009\" /><ref name=\"Arlot Dumas et al. 2008\" />\n\nCurrently Umbriel is not involved in any [[orbital resonance]] with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]]. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected.<ref name=\"Tittemore Wisdom 1990\" /> Due to Uranus's lower [[oblate spheroid|oblate]]ness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of [[Jupiter]] or [[Saturn]]. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.<ref name=\"Tittemore Wisdom 1989\" /><ref name=\"Malhotra Dermott 1990\" />\n\n== Composition and internal structure ==\n[[File:Umbriel Earth Moon Comparison.png|thumb|left|250px|Size comparison of [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and Umbriel.]]\n\nUmbriel is the third largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons.{{efn|Due to the current [[observational error]], it is not yet known for certain whether [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] is more massive than Umbriel.<ref name=\"JPLSSD\"/>}} The moon's density is 1.39&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<ref name=\"Jacobson Campbell et al. 1992\"/> which indicates that it mainly consists of [[Ice|water ice]], with a dense non-ice component constituting around 40% of its mass.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\"/> The latter could be made of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[carbon]]aceous material including heavy [[organic compound]]s known as [[tholin]]s.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> The presence of water ice is supported by [[infrared]] [[spectroscopic]] observations, which have revealed [[crystalline]] water ice on the surface of the moon.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> Water ice [[absorption band]]s are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the [[magnetosphere of Uranus]], which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The energetic particles tend to [[sputtering|sputter]] water ice, decompose [[methane]] trapped in ice as [[clathrate hydrate]] and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] behind.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" />\n\nExcept for water, the only other compound identified on the surface of Umbriel by the infrared spectroscopy is [[carbon dioxide]], which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" /> The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from [[carbonate]]s or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus or the solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the [[outgassing]] of the [[Primordial element|primordial]] CO<sub>2</sub> trapped by water ice in Umbriel's interior. The escape of CO<sub>2</sub> from the interior may be a result of past geological activity on this moon.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" />\n\nUmbriel may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] surrounded by an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> If this is the case, the radius of the core (317&nbsp;km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon's mass\u2014the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure in the center of Umbriel is about 0.24&nbsp;[[GPa]] (2.4&nbsp;[[kbar]]).<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" />\n\n== Surface features ==\nUmbriel's surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons, and reflects less than half as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size.<ref name=\"JPLSSD\" /> Umbriel has a very low [[Bond albedo]] of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel.<ref name=\"Karkoschka 2001, Hubble\" /> The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0\u00b0 ([[geometric albedo]]) to 19% at an angle of about 1\u00b0. This phenomenon is called [[opposition surge]]. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color,<ref name=\"Bell McCord 1991\" /> while fresh bright impact deposits (in [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]] crater, for instance)<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter.<ref name=\"Buratti Mosher 1991\" /> The reddening of the surfaces probably results from [[space weathering]] from bombardment by charged particles and [[Micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] over the age of the [[Solar System]].<ref name=\"Bell McCord 1991\" /> However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from [[irregular satellite]]s, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.<ref name=\"Buratti Mosher 1991\" /> The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous\u2014it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.<ref name=\"Bell McCord 1991\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+ Named craters on Umbriel<ref name=\"usgs\" />{{efn|name=spirits|Surface features on Umbriel are named for evil or dark spirits taken from various mythologies.<ref name=\"Strobell & Masursky 1987\" />}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Crater\n! scope=\"col\" | Named after\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Coordinates\n! scope=\"col\" | Diameter (km)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Alberich\n| [[Alberich]] ([[Norse mythology|Norse]])\n| {{coord|33.6|S|42.2|E|dim:52.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 52.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Fin\n| [[Fin (troll)|Fin]] ([[Danish folklore|Danish]])\n| {{coord|37.4|S|44.3|E|dim:43.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 43.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gob\n| Gob ([[Paganism|Pagan]])\n| {{coord|12.7|S|27.8|E|dim:88.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 88.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kanaloa\n| [[Kanaloa]] ([[Polynesian mythology|Polynesian]])\n| {{coord|10.8|S|345.7|E|dim:86.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 86.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Malingee\n| Malingee ([[Australian Aboriginal mythology]])\n| {{coord|22.9|S|13.9|E|dim:164.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 164.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Minepa\n| [[Minepa]] ([[Makua (people)|Makua]] people of [[Mozambique]])\n| {{coord|42.7|S|8.2|E|dim:58.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 58.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Peri\n| [[Peri]] ([[Islamic mythology|Persian]])\n| {{coord|9.2|S|4.3|E|dim:61.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 61.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Setibos\n| [[Setebos (Shakespeare)|Setebos]] ([[Patagonia]]n)\n| {{coord|30.8|S|346.3|E|dim:50.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 50.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Skynd (crater)|Skynd]]\n| [[Skynd]] ([[Danish folklore|Danish]])\n| {{coord|1.8|S|331.7|E|dim:72.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 72.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Vuver (crater)|Vuver]]\n| [[Vuver]] ([[Finnish mythology|Finnish]])\n| {{coord|4.7|S|311.6|E|dim:98.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 98.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Wokolo (crater)|Wokolo]]\n| Wokolo ([[Bambara people]] of West Africa)\n| {{coord|30|S|1.8|E|dim:208.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 208.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]]\n| Wunda (Australian Aboriginal mythology)\n| {{coord|7.9|S|273.6|E|dim:131.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 131.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zlyden\n| [[Zlyden]] ([[Slavic mythology|Slavic]])\n| {{coord|23.3|S|326.2|E|dim:44.0km_globe:umbriel_type:landmark}}\n| 44.0\n|}\n\nScientists have so far recognized only one class of geological feature on Umbriel\u2014[[Impact crater|craters]].<ref name=\"usgs\" /> The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and [[Titania (moon)|Titania]]. It shows the least geological activity.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers at the low end to 210&nbsp;kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /><ref name=\"usgs\" /> All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks,<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> but no crater has [[Ray system|rays]].<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nNear Umbriel's equator lies the most prominent surface feature: Wunda crater, which has a diameter of about 131&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"usgsWunda\" /><ref name=\"hunt\" /> Wunda has a large ring of bright material on its floor, which may be an impact deposit<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> or deposit of carbon dioxide ice.<ref name=Sori2017/> Nearby, seen along the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], are the craters [[Vuver (crater)|Vuver]] and [[Skynd (crater)|Skynd]], which lack bright rims but possess bright central peaks.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /><ref name=\"hunt\" /> Study of limb profiles of Umbriel revealed a possible very large impact feature having the diameter of about 400&nbsp;km and depth of approximately 5&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Moore Schenk et al. 2004\" />\n\nMuch like other moons of Uranus, the surface of Umbriel is cut by a system of canyons trending northeast\u2013southwest.<ref name=\"Croft1989\" /> They are not, however, officially recognized due to the poor imaging resolution and generally bland appearance of this moon, which hinders [[Geologic map|geological mapping]].<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" />\n\nUmbriel's heavily cratered surface has probably been stable since the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons\u2014dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across.<ref name=\"Helfenstein Thomas et al. 1989\" /> The polygons were identified from precise photometry of ''Voyager 2'''s images and are distributed more or less uniformly on the surface of Umbriel, trending northeast\u2013southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity.<ref name=\"Helfenstein Thomas et al. 1989\" /> Currently there is no explanation for why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called ''[[umbra]]l material'') excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption.{{efn|While a co-orbiting population of dust particles is another possible source of the dark material, this is considered less likely because other satellites were not affected.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />}}<ref name=\"Buratti Mosher 1991\" /> Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\n== Origin and evolution ==\n[[File:Umbriel usgsx2.jpg|thumb|Map of Umbriel showing polygons|alt=A spherical blueish body with its surface covered by craters and polygons. The lower right part is smooth.]]\n\nUmbriel is thought to have formed from an [[accretion disc]] or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large [[Axial tilt|obliquity]].<ref name=\"Mousis 2004\" /> The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the [[moons of Saturn]] indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor.{{efn|For instance, [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], a Saturnian moon, has a density of 0.97&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which suggests that over 90% of its composition is water.<ref name=\"Grundy Young et al. 2006\" />}}<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> Significant amounts of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] may have been present in the form of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[nitrogen|molecular nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) instead of [[ammonia]] and methane.<ref name=\"Mousis 2004\" /> The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N<sub>2</sub> trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nUmbriel's accretion probably lasted for several thousand years.<ref name=\"Mousis 2004\" /> The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer.<ref name=\"Squyres Reynolds et al. 1988\" /> The maximum temperature of around 180&nbsp;K was reached at the depth of about 3&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Squyres Reynolds et al. 1988\" /> After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Umbriel heated due to decay of [[radioactivity|radioactive elements]] present in its rocks.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong [[Stress (mechanics)|extensional stresses]] in the moon's crust, which may have led to cracking.<ref name=\"Hillier & Squyres 1991\" /> This process probably lasted for about 200&nbsp;million years, implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions of years ago.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nThe initial [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretional heating]] together with continued decay of radioactive elements may have led to melting of the ice<ref name=\"Squyres Reynolds et al. 1988\" /> if an [[antifreeze]] like ammonia (in the form of [[hydrate|ammonia hydrate]]) or some salt was present.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> The melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core\u2013mantle boundary. The [[eutectic temperature]] of this mixture is 176&nbsp;K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago.<ref name=\"Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006\" /> Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes,<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.<ref name=\"Helfenstein Thomas et al. 1989\" />\n\n== Exploration ==\n[[File:Voyager_spacecraft.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The Voyager 2 spacecraft]]\n{{Further|Exploration of Uranus}}\n\nSo far the only close-up images of Umbriel have been from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between ''Voyager 2'' and Umbriel was {{convert|325000|km|mi|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Stone 1987\" /> the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 5.2&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 20% was photographed with the quality required for [[geological mapping]].<ref name=\"Plescia 1987\" /> At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> No other spacecraft has ever visited Uranus or its moons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of natural satellites]]\n{{Portal bar|Astronomy}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notes\n| colwidth = 30em\n| notes =\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth = 30em\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"dict-def\">\n{{MW|Umbriel}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\">\n{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.233.4759.43| last1 = Smith| first1 = B.

The film depicts Knievel reflecting on major events in his life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend/wife, Linda. The film opens with Knievel at the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]]. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:\n\n:''Ladies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars&nbsp;\u2014 and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row&nbsp;\u2014 before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, \"Mr Knievel, are you crazy?

They told the [[Wright Brothers]] to fly was impossible. And they probably told [[Neil Armstrong]] a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the [[Grand Canyon]] is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: \"If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.''\n\nFollowing his introduction, the story follows a flashback narrative through Knievel's life.\n\nThe film ends with Knievel successfully completing the jump at the Ontario Motor Speedway and riding off onto a dirt road which leads to the edge of the Grand Canyon. (At the time of production, the real Evel Knievel was hyping a jump over the Grand Canyon.)\n\n==Monologue==\nAs the movie closes over the Grand Canyon, George Hamilton delivers a voice-over monologue in the Knievel character. In the monologue, he describes himself as the \"last gladiator\", which would later be used by the real Evel Knievel in his 1998 documentary, ''The Last of the Gladiators''.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the monologue from the movie:\n:''Important people in this country, celebrities like myself \u2014 [[Elvis]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[John Wayne]] \u2014 we have a responsibility. There are millions of people that look at our lives and it gives theirs some meaning. People come out from their jobs, most of which are meaningless to them, and they watch me jump 20 cars, maybe get splattered. It means something to them.

While preparing to film it, he interviewed various stunt men for the lead role and heard about Knievel. He visited the stuntman in a San Francisco hospital and found him more fascinating than what he was writing. In 1970, Hamilton stated that:\n<blockquote>In America we've long had a theory that all men have an equal right to become everything they want. But there's a new theory being pushed on us - that every man has to be something whether he wants to or not. That's what the theory of Evil Knievel is about. He's an individual who doesn't care about establishment or hippie, both have their phony sides. I'm not sure why Evil does what he does on a motorcycle.

However George Hamilton was not happy with it. He offered to pay [[John Milius]] $5,000 to write some lines in the script. Milius says he went to Hamilton's home at Palm Springs to read the script \"and it was terrible. So I threw the script in the pool and beat on it with an oar. And of course the script was waterlogged, so I just wrote another one. He later told me he knew that if I got down there with that script I'd write another one.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nMilius says Knievel \"saw himself as the new gladiator of the new Rome, something larger than a daredevil. He saw the whole spectacle of civilization and the absurdity of what it's turned into, and he fit into that.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nMilius later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nHamilton later recalled:\n<blockquote>Milius made me read the script to Evel. I realized he was kind of a sociopath and was totally messed. Then all of sudden Evel started to adopt lines out of the movie for himself. So his persona in the movie became more of his persona in real life. He would have been every kid\u2019s hero on one hand, but then he went and took that baseball bat and broke that guy\u2019s arm and that finished his career in the toy business. Evel was very, very difficult and he was jealous of anybody that was gonna play him. He wanted to portray himself and he did go and make his own movie later on. He had a great perception of this warrior that he thought he was and that was good. Then he had this other side of himself where he\u2019d turn on you in a minute. Success is something that you have earn. You have to have a humility for it, because it can leave you in a second. It may remember you but it can sure leave you. I think if you don\u2019t get that and you don\u2019t have gratitude for what you are and where you are it doesn\u2019t come back and it goes away forever.<ref>[http://www.popentertainment.com/georgehamilton.htm Interview with George Hamilton at Pop Entertainment] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe picture was directed by [[Marvin J. Chomsky]] and was released on September 10, 1971.\n\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Butte, Montana]]. Actual footage of Knievel jumping his motorcycle was used throughout the film.  Additionally, Knievel performed a series of new jumps at the Ontario Motor Speedway for the production, including a spectacular record jump of 129 feet over 19 cars that was included in the film (Knievel held the record for jumping a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle over 19 cars for 27 years, until broken by [[Bubba Blackwell]] in 1998).  Knievel received a flat rate of $25,000 for his rights and the consulting fee.<ref>Life of Evel Knievel, S. Baker, St. Martin's Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Milius said he preferred the film \"to the other movies from my scripts. They didn't restrain it or tone it down, they shot the script. The guy is just as obnoxious and full of hot air as he was in the script. Just as full of life and vitality too. He's Evel Knievel! He wouldn't take a dime off of anybody.\"<ref>Strawn, L.

The title song, \"I Do What I Please\", is played throughout the film, including the opening and closing credits, and the montage of the real Evel Knievel's stunt riding.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1971]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0067069}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=EvelKnievel|name=Evel Knievel}}\n\n{{John Milius}}\n{{Marvin J.

He saw the whole spectacle of civilization and the absurdity of what it's turned into, and he fit into that.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nMilius later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nHamilton later recalled:\n<blockquote>Milius made me read the script to Evel. I realized he was kind of a sociopath and was totally messed. Then all of sudden Evel started to adopt lines out of the movie for himself. So his persona in the movie became more of his persona in real life. He would have been every kid\u2019s hero on one hand, but then he went and took that baseball bat and broke that guy\u2019s arm and that finished his career in the toy business. Evel was very, very difficult and he was jealous of anybody that was gonna play him. He wanted to portray himself and he did go and make his own movie later on. He had a great perception of this warrior that he thought he was and that was good. Then he had this other side of himself where he\u2019d turn on you in a minute. Success is something that you have earn. You have to have a humility for it, because it can leave you in a second. It may remember you but it can sure leave you. I think if you don\u2019t get that and you don\u2019t have gratitude for what you are and where you are it doesn\u2019t come back and it goes away forever.<ref>[http://www.popentertainment.com/georgehamilton.htm Interview with George Hamilton at Pop Entertainment] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe picture was directed by [[Marvin J. Chomsky]] and was released on September 10, 1971.\n\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Butte, Montana]]. Actual footage of Knievel jumping his motorcycle was used throughout the film.  Additionally, Knievel performed a series of new jumps at the Ontario Motor Speedway for the production, including a spectacular record jump of 129 feet over 19 cars that was included in the film (Knievel held the record for jumping a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle over 19 cars for 27 years, until broken by [[Bubba Blackwell]] in 1998).  Knievel received a flat rate of $25,000 for his rights and the consulting fee.<ref>Life of Evel Knievel, S. Baker, St. Martin's Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Milius said he preferred the film \"to the other movies from my scripts. They didn't restrain it or tone it down, they shot the script. The guy is just as obnoxious and full of hot air as he was in the script. Just as full of life and vitality too. He's Evel Knievel! He wouldn't take a dime off of anybody.\"<ref>Strawn, L.

Drawen into a plain method according to the written copye. by Abraham Fleming.\"]]\nOne of the most notable reports of Black Shuck is of his appearance at the churches of [[Bungay, Suffolk|Bungay]] and [[Blythburgh]] in Suffolk. On 4 August 1577, at Blythburgh, Black Shuck is said to have burst in through the doors of [[Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh|Holy Trinity Church]] to a clap of thunder. He ran up the nave, past a large congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the church [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] to collapse through the roof. As the dog left, he left scorch marks on the north door which can be seen at the church to this day.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Seymour|title=The companion guide to East Anglia|publisher=Collins|date=1977}}</ref>\n\nThe encounter on the same day at [[St Mary's Church, Bungay]] was described in ''A Straunge and Terrible Wunder'' by [[Abraham Fleming]] in 1577:\n{{quote|This black dog, or the divel in such a linenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down the body of the church with great swiftnesse, and incredible haste, among the people, in a visible fourm and shape, passed between two persons, as they were kneeling uppon their knees, and occupied in prayer as it seemed, wrung the necks of them bothe at one instant clene backward, in somuch that even at a mome[n]t where they kneeled, they stra[n]gely dyed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Abraham Adams|title=A strange, and terrible wunder|location=London|date=1577}}</ref>}}\n\nFleming was a translator and editor for several printing houses in London, and therefore probably only published his account based on exaggerated [[Oral tradition|oral accounts]].

On 4 August 1577, at Blythburgh, Black Shuck is said to have burst in through the doors of [[Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh|Holy Trinity Church]] to a clap of thunder. He ran up the nave, past a large congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the church [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] to collapse through the roof.

Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east ([[Roumois]] and [[Pays de Caux]]) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], and were separated by traditional ''[[Pagus|pagii]]'', where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents from Scandinavia who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the European Atlantic coast included [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Norwegians]], [[Norse\u2013Gaels]], [[Orkney|Orkney Vikings]], possibly [[Swedes]], and Anglo-Danes from the English [[Danelaw]] territory which earlier came under Norse control in the early [[11th century]].\n\nThe descendants of Vikings replaced the [[Norse religion]] and [[Old Norse]] language with [[Catholicism]] ([[Christianity]]) and the [[Langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'oil]] of the local people, descending from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The [[Norman language]] (Norman French ) was forged by the adoption of the indigenous ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl|langue d'o\u00efl]]'' branch of [[Romance languages|Romance]] by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the [[Languages of France|French regional languages]] that survive today.<ref name=\"Norman\" />\n\nThe Normans thereafter adopted the growing [[feudalism|feudal]] doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both [[Normandy]] and in [[Norman England|Norman dominated England]].<ref name=\"searle\"/> The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old [[French nobility|French aristocracy]], most of whom traced their lineage to the [[Franks]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] from the days of [[Charlemagne]] in the [[9th century]]. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by the time of the expedition and invasion of England in 1066, Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of [[Italy]], France and England eventually served as avid [[Crusades|Crusaders]] soldiers under the [[Italo-Norman]] prince [[Bohemund I of Antioch]] and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] king [[Richard the Lion-Heart]], one of the more famous and illustrious Kings of England.\n\n==Conquests and military offensives==\n===Italy===\n{{See also|Norman conquest of southern Italy|Emirate of Sicily|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Robert Guiscard|Italo-Norman}}\n[[File:Adrano normannisches Kastell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The early Norman castle at [[Adrano]]]]\n\nOpportunistic bands of Normans successfully established a foothold in [[southern Italy]]. Probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories, the Normans entered southern Italy as warriors in 1017 at the latest. In 999, according to [[Amatus of Montecassino]], Norman pilgrims returning from [[Jerusalem]] called in at the port of [[Salerno]] when a [[Saracen]] attack occurred. The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the Prince's request. [[William of Apulia]] tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Gargano]] were met by [[Melus of Bari]], a [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, which they did.\n\nThe two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the [[Mediterranean]] were descendants of [[Tancred of Hauteville]] and the [[Drengot family]].\nA group of Normans with at least five brothers from the Drengot family fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Apulia]] under the command of Melo di Bari. Between 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of [[Ariano Irpino|Ariano]] was founded by another group of Norman knights headed by [[Gilbert Buat\u00e8re]] and hired by Melo di Bari. Defeated at [[Canne]], Melo di Bari escaped to [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], where he died in 1022. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, is considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesn.it/mezzogiorno.htm|title=Il Mezzogiorno agli inizi dell'XI secolo|trans-title=The south of Italy at the beginning of 11th century|website=European Center for Norman Studies|language=Italian}}</ref>\nThen [[Rainulf Drengot]], from the same family, received the county of [[Aversa]] from Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples]] in 1030.\n\nThe [[Hauteville family]] achieved princely rank by proclaiming Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] \"Duke of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]\". He promptly awarded their elected leader, [[William Iron Arm]], with the title of count in his capital of [[Melfi]]. The Drengot family thereafter attained the [[principality of Capua]], and Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], as \"''dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae''\" (\"''Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria''\") in 1047.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Brown, R.

Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside [[Varangian]] and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of [[George Maniaces]] in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\n[[File:Normannen.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Norman expansion by 1130]]\n\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was [[Herv\u00e9 (Norman)|Herv\u00e9]] in the 1050s. By then, however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They were based at [[Malatya]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], under the Byzantine duke of [[Antioch]], [[Isaac Komnenos, Duke of Antioch|Isaac Komnenos]]. In the 1060s, [[Robert Crispin]] led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. [[Roussel de Bailleul]] even tried to carve out an independent state in [[Asia Minor]] with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general [[Alexius I Komnenos|Alexius Komnenos]].\n\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenian vassal-states of [[Sassoun]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in far eastern [[Anatolia]]. Later, many took up service with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian state further south in Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]. A Norman named [[Roussel de Bailleul|Oursel]] led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper [[Euphrates]] valley in northern [[Syria]]. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general [[Philaretus Brachamius]] were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by [[Raimbaud]]. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks\". The known trade between [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and Antioch and between [[Bari]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the [[Comnenian Restoration]], when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of [[Albania]]n clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under [[George Maniaces]] in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\n[[Robert Guiscard]], another Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of [[Apulia]] as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern [[Italy]]. Having obtained the consent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of [[Albania]], capturing [[Vlora|Valona]], [[Kanin\u00eb|Kanina]], Jericho ([[Orikumi]]), and reaching [[Butrint]] after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Dyrrachium]] from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The [[Albania]]n forces could not take part in the ensuing [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|battle]] because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the city of Dyrrachium to the [[Count of the Tent]] (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from [[Arbanon]] (i.e., \u1f10\u03be \u1f08\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7; the term ''\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7'' is short for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning \"Count of the Tent\").<ref>[[Anna Comnena]]. ''The Alexiad'', 4.8; {{harvnb|Vranousi|1962|pp=5\u201326}}.</ref> The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and [[Amalfi]]tan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and [[Butrint]] in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nA few years after the [[First Crusade]], in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied [[Petrela]], the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river [[Devoll (river)|Deabolis]], Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the [[Arbanon]] passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded [[Dyrrachium]], owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the [[Adriatic]]\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\n===England===\n<!--Tostig Godwinson links here-->\n{{See also|Norman conquest of England|William the Conqueror|Domesday Book|Anglo-Normans}}\n{{House of Normandy}}\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the [[English Channel]]. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], and King [[Ethelred II of England]]. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]]. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after [[Cnut the Great]]'s conquest of the isle.\n\nWhen [[Edward the Confessor]] finally returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother [[Harthacnut]], he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]] [[archbishop of Canterbury]] and made [[Ralph the Timid]] [[earl of Hereford]]. He invited his brother-in-law [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]].\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail Castle Dinan.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Siege of a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nOn 14 October 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gained a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the conquest of England three years later;<ref>''The Normans'', [[Marjorie Chibnall]]</ref> this can be seen on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] (a linen, embroidered cloth). The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).\n\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that [[Marjorie Chibnall]] says \"writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Chibnall|first=Marjorie|authorlink = Marjorie Chibnall|publisher=Blackwell publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4051-4965-5|location=Oxford|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref> In the course of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The [[Anglo-Norman language]] became distinct from the [[Latin language]], something that was the subject of some humour by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see [[Old English]]) and influenced it, helping (along with the [[Norse language]] of the earlier [[Danelaw|Anglo-Norse]] settlers and the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] used by the church) in the development of [[Middle English]]. It in turn evolved into [[Modern English]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Ireland|Normans in Ireland}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Norman keep in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[County Meath]]]]\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves (slogan)|more Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and also built many fine castles and settlements, including [[Trim Castle]] and [[Dublin Castle]]. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their [[surnames]]. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County [[Wexford]], where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry. Except for the native surname Fitzpatrick, a [[gallicisation]] of Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig/\u00d3 Maol Ph\u00e1draig. Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include [[FitzGerald dynasty|Fitzgerald]], FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, [[Fitzmaurice]]. Families bearing such surnames as [[Barry (name)|Barry (de Barra)]] and [[House of Burke|De B\u00farca (Burke)]] are also of Norman extraction.\n\n===Scotland===\n{{See also|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scoto-Norman}}\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Edgar Atheling]], eventually fled to Scotland. King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] married Edgar's sister [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nNormans went into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings, such as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], as well as founding a considerable number of the [[Scottish clan]]s. King [[David I of Scotland]], whose elder brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] had married [[Sybilla of Normandy]], was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], part of the process some scholars call the \"[[Davidian Revolution]]\". Having spent time at the court of [[Henry I of England]] (married to David's sister [[Edith of Scotland|Maud of Scotland]]), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]]. The Norman-derived [[feudal]] system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names [[Bruce (surname)|Bruce]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], Ramsay, Fraser, Rose, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and [[Gordon (surname)|Gordon]] to name but a few, and including the later royal [[House of Stewart]], can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\n===Wales===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Wales|Cambro-Norman}}\n[[File:Mms chepstow castle from river wye.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Chepstow Castle]] in Wales, built by [[William fitzOsbern]] in 1067]]\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with [[Wales]]. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]], [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Hugh, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]] in [[Cheshire]]. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as ''baron'' (''barwn''), first entered [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at that time.\n\n===On crusade===\n{{See also|Principality of Antioch|Bohemund I of Antioch|Richard the Lion-Heart}}\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the [[First Crusade]] carved out a Norman [[Principality of Antioch|principality in Antioch]]. They were major foreign participants in the [[Reconquista]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 1018, [[Roger I of Tosny|Roger de Tosny]] travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from [[Moorish]] lands, but failed. In 1064, during the [[War of Barbastro]], [[William of Montreuil]] led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of [[Amalfi]] were joined by [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the ''de facto'' leader of the Crusade during its passage through [[Asia Minor]]. After the successful [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and he worked for the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader kingdom]] in [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and the region of [[Galilee]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Anglo-Norman conquest of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}[[File:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Illuminated manuscript showing king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] authorizing [[Guy de Lusignan]] to take [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]\nThe conquest of [[Cyprus]] by the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] forces of the [[Third Crusade]] opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under [[Western Europe]]an domination for the following 380 years. Although not part of a planned operation, the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected.\n\nIn April 1191, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] left [[Messina]] with a large fleet in order to reach [[Acre (city)|Acre]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 131}} But a storm dispersed the fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc\u00e9e Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's despot [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 132}} On 1 May 1191, Richard's fleet arrived in the port of [[Limassol]] on Cyprus.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 132}} He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 132}} Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 133\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Limassol - Ch\u00e2teau.jpg|thumb|left|Castle of [[Limassol]], near which Richard's wedding with [[Berengaria of Navarre]] is said to have taken place]]\nVarious princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time, in particular [[Guy de Lusignan]]. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival [[Conrad of Montferrat]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 134}} The local barons abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the [[crusade]], and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | pp = 134\u201336}} But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape. Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Richard left for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 5 June, with his allies.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, [[Richard de Camville]] and [[Robert of Thornham|Robert de Thornham]], as governors of Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]. The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]], whom he had brought from [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned [[King of Cyprus]], and Berengaria Queen of England and [[List of Cypriot consorts|Queen of Cyprus]] as well.\n\n[[File:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Norman expeditionary ship depicted in the chronicle ''[[Le Canarien]]'' (1490)]]\n\nThe rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed. The island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the [[Knights Templar]] and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy de Lusignan and became a [[Kingdom of Cyprus|stable feudal kingdom]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} It was only in 1489 that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] acquired full control of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|fall of Famagusta]] in 1571.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}}\n\n===Canary Islands===\n{{see also|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}\nBetween 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble [[Jean de Bethencourt]]<ref name=\"EB1911Bethencourt\">{{EB1911|wstitle=B\u00e9thencourt, Jean de|volume=3}}</ref> and the [[Poitevine]] [[Gadifer de la Salle]] conquered the [[Canary Islands|Canarian islands]] of [[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]] and [[El Hierro]] off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by [[Castilian people|Castilian]] colonists.\n\nBethencourt took the title of [[King of the Canary Islands]], as vassal to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In 1418, Jean's nephew [[Maciot de Bethencourt]] sold the rights to the islands to [[Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla]].\n\n==Culture==\n===Norman law===\n{{main|Norman law|Clameur de haro}}\nThe [[Custom (law)|customary law]] of [[Normandy]] was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. Norman customary law was transcribed in two [[Coutume|customaries]] in [[Latin]] by two judges for use by them and their colleagues:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/cultures/GB_FR/culture1_7.htm|title=Norman customary law|website=Mondes-normands.caen.fr|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> These are the ''Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier'' (''Very ancient customary''), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the ''Grand coutumier de Normandie'' (''Great customary of Normandy'', originally ''Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali''), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Norman architecture}}\n[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|A quintessential Norman keep: the [[Tower of London|White Tower]] in [[London]]]]\n\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque idiom]] to England, Italy and Ireland, and the [[encastellation]] of these regions with [[keep]]s in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded [[arch]]es, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and precedes the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]]. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Lombardic architecture|Lombard]], and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture#Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture|Norman-Arab architecture]] within the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref name=\"Sicily\" />\n\n===Visual arts===\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the [[Cluniac reform]] of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of [[scriptoria]] and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Bec-de-Mortagne|Bec]], [[Saint-Ouen, Rouen|Saint-Ouen]], [[Saint-Evroul]], and [[Saint-Wandrille]]. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"[[Winchester]] school\", which channeled a pure [[Carolingian art]]istic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\n[[File:Lion, Norman Italy 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bronze lion sculpture attributed to an [[Italo-Norman]] artist. Now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion]] in the 16th century and the [[French Revolution]] in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which is not a [[tapestry]] but a work of [[embroidery]]. It was commissioned by [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] and first [[Earl of Kent]], employing natives from [[Kent]] who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]].\n\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as [[stonework]] or [[metalwork]], such as [[capital (column)|capitals]] and [[baptismal font]]s. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of [[ivory]]work in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. The intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:David on harp.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from [[Saint-Evroul]] depicting [[King David]] on the lyre (or harp) in the middle of the back of the initial 'B']]\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of [[classical music]] in the 11th century. [[F\u00e9camp Abbey]] and [[Saint-Evroul Abbey]] were centres of musical production and education. At F\u00e9camp, under two Italian abbots, [[William of Volpiano]] and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at F\u00e9camp, the [[Staff (music)|staff]], around which [[neume]]s were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot [[Isembard of La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont|Isembard]], [[La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont]] became a centre of musical composition.\n\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot [[Robert de Grantmesnil]], several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at [[Lamezia Terme#Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia]]. There they continued the tradition of singing.\n\n==Rulers==\n* [[Dukes of Normandy#Succession of the Dukes of Normandy|List of Dukes of Normandy]]\n* [[Count of Apulia|List of Counts and Dukes of Apulia and Calabria]]\n* [[List of Counts of Aversa]]\n* [[List of Princes of Capua]]\n* [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta|List of Dukes of Gaeta]]\n* [[Principality of Taranto#Hauteville (Altavilla) dynasty|List of Princes of Taranto]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Sicily]]\n* [[Principality of Antioch#Princes of Antioch, 1098\u20131268|List of Princes of Antioch]]\n* [[Officers of the Principality of Antioch|List of Officers of the Principality of Antioch]]\n* [[Lusignan dynasty#Second House of Lusignan|Second House of Lusignan]]\n* [[List of English monarchs#Normans|List of English Monarchs]]\n* [[List of Scottish monarchs]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture|France}}\n* [[House of Normandy]]\n* [[Norman language]]\n* [[Norsemen]]\n* [[Rus' people]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Primary===\n* {{Citation | editor-first = Elisabeth | editor-last = van Houts | title = The Normans in Europe | publisher = Manchester Medieval Sources | place = Manchester | year = 2000}}.\n* {{Citation | url = http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/medievalTexts.htm | title = Medieval History Texts in Translation | publisher = [[University of Leeds]]}}.\n\n===Secondary===\n* {{Citation | last = Bates | first = David | title = Normandy before 1066 | place = London | year = 1982}}\n* {{Citation | first = R.

Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east ([[Roumois]] and [[Pays de Caux]]) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], and were separated by traditional ''[[Pagus|pagii]]'', where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents from Scandinavia who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the European Atlantic coast included [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Norwegians]], [[Norse\u2013Gaels]], [[Orkney|Orkney Vikings]], possibly [[Swedes]], and Anglo-Danes from the English [[Danelaw]] territory which earlier came under Norse control in the early [[11th century]].\n\nThe descendants of Vikings replaced the [[Norse religion]] and [[Old Norse]] language with [[Catholicism]] ([[Christianity]]) and the [[Langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'oil]] of the local people, descending from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The [[Norman language]] (Norman French ) was forged by the adoption of the indigenous ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl|langue d'o\u00efl]]'' branch of [[Romance languages|Romance]] by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the [[Languages of France|French regional languages]] that survive today.<ref name=\"Norman\" />\n\nThe Normans thereafter adopted the growing [[feudalism|feudal]] doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both [[Normandy]] and in [[Norman England|Norman dominated England]].<ref name=\"searle\"/> The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old [[French nobility|French aristocracy]], most of whom traced their lineage to the [[Franks]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] from the days of [[Charlemagne]] in the [[9th century]]. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by the time of the expedition and invasion of England in 1066, Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of [[Italy]], France and England eventually served as avid [[Crusades|Crusaders]] soldiers under the [[Italo-Norman]] prince [[Bohemund I of Antioch]] and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] king [[Richard the Lion-Heart]], one of the more famous and illustrious Kings of England.\n\n==Conquests and military offensives==\n===Italy===\n{{See also|Norman conquest of southern Italy|Emirate of Sicily|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Robert Guiscard|Italo-Norman}}\n[[File:Adrano normannisches Kastell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The early Norman castle at [[Adrano]]]]\n\nOpportunistic bands of Normans successfully established a foothold in [[southern Italy]]. Probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories, the Normans entered southern Italy as warriors in 1017 at the latest. In 999, according to [[Amatus of Montecassino]], Norman pilgrims returning from [[Jerusalem]] called in at the port of [[Salerno]] when a [[Saracen]] attack occurred. The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the Prince's request. [[William of Apulia]] tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Gargano]] were met by [[Melus of Bari]], a [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, which they did.\n\nThe two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the [[Mediterranean]] were descendants of [[Tancred of Hauteville]] and the [[Drengot family]].\nA group of Normans with at least five brothers from the Drengot family fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Apulia]] under the command of Melo di Bari. Between 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of [[Ariano Irpino|Ariano]] was founded by another group of Norman knights headed by [[Gilbert Buat\u00e8re]] and hired by Melo di Bari. Defeated at [[Canne]], Melo di Bari escaped to [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], where he died in 1022. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, is considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesn.it/mezzogiorno.htm|title=Il Mezzogiorno agli inizi dell'XI secolo|trans-title=The south of Italy at the beginning of 11th century|website=European Center for Norman Studies|language=Italian}}</ref>\nThen [[Rainulf Drengot]], from the same family, received the county of [[Aversa]] from Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples]] in 1030.\n\nThe [[Hauteville family]] achieved princely rank by proclaiming Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] \"Duke of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]\". He promptly awarded their elected leader, [[William Iron Arm]], with the title of count in his capital of [[Melfi]]. The Drengot family thereafter attained the [[principality of Capua]], and Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], as \"''dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae''\" (\"''Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria''\") in 1047.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Brown, R.

Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s and Christians, both [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]. The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine, Greek, Arab, Lombard and \"native\" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its [[List of monarchs of Sicily#Kings of Sicily|Norman rulers]] fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] as well as the [[crusader states]] in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II \u2014King of Sicily |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |newspaper=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}</ref><ref>''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.</ref> One of the great geographical treatises of the [[Middle Ages]], the \"''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]''\", was written by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[al-Idrisi]] for King Roger II of Sicily, and entitled \"''Kitab Rudjdjar''\" (\"''The Book of Roger''\").<ref name=\"Lewis, p.148\">Lewis, p.148</ref>\n\n=== North Africa===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Africa}}\nBetween 1135 and 1160, the Norman kingdom of Sicily conquered and kept as vassals several cities on the [[Ifriqiya]] coast,  corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today.\nThey were lost to the Almohads.\n\n===Byzantium===\n{{See also|Byzantine-Norman wars|Varangian Guard|William Iron Arm}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2012}}\n{{context|section|date=December 2012}}\nSoon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]], fighting against the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Bulgars]], and especially the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside [[Varangian]] and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of [[George Maniaces]] in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\n[[File:Normannen.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Norman expansion by 1130]]\n\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was [[Herv\u00e9 (Norman)|Herv\u00e9]] in the 1050s. By then, however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They were based at [[Malatya]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], under the Byzantine duke of [[Antioch]], [[Isaac Komnenos, Duke of Antioch|Isaac Komnenos]]. In the 1060s, [[Robert Crispin]] led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. [[Roussel de Bailleul]] even tried to carve out an independent state in [[Asia Minor]] with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general [[Alexius I Komnenos|Alexius Komnenos]].\n\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenian vassal-states of [[Sassoun]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in far eastern [[Anatolia]]. Later, many took up service with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian state further south in Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]. A Norman named [[Roussel de Bailleul|Oursel]] led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper [[Euphrates]] valley in northern [[Syria]]. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general [[Philaretus Brachamius]] were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by [[Raimbaud]]. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks\". The known trade between [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and Antioch and between [[Bari]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the [[Comnenian Restoration]], when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of [[Albania]]n clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under [[George Maniaces]] in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\n[[Robert Guiscard]], another Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of [[Apulia]] as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern [[Italy]]. Having obtained the consent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of [[Albania]], capturing [[Vlora|Valona]], [[Kanin\u00eb|Kanina]], Jericho ([[Orikumi]]), and reaching [[Butrint]] after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Dyrrachium]] from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The [[Albania]]n forces could not take part in the ensuing [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|battle]] because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the city of Dyrrachium to the [[Count of the Tent]] (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from [[Arbanon]] (i.e., \u1f10\u03be \u1f08\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7; the term ''\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7'' is short for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning \"Count of the Tent\").<ref>[[Anna Comnena]]. ''The Alexiad'', 4.8; {{harvnb|Vranousi|1962|pp=5\u201326}}.</ref> The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and [[Amalfi]]tan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and [[Butrint]] in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nA few years after the [[First Crusade]], in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied [[Petrela]], the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river [[Devoll (river)|Deabolis]], Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the [[Arbanon]] passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded [[Dyrrachium]], owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the [[Adriatic]]\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\n===England===\n<!--Tostig Godwinson links here-->\n{{See also|Norman conquest of England|William the Conqueror|Domesday Book|Anglo-Normans}}\n{{House of Normandy}}\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the [[English Channel]]. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], and King [[Ethelred II of England]]. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]]. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after [[Cnut the Great]]'s conquest of the isle.\n\nWhen [[Edward the Confessor]] finally returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother [[Harthacnut]], he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]] [[archbishop of Canterbury]] and made [[Ralph the Timid]] [[earl of Hereford]]. He invited his brother-in-law [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]].\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail Castle Dinan.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Siege of a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nOn 14 October 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gained a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the conquest of England three years later;<ref>''The Normans'', [[Marjorie Chibnall]]</ref> this can be seen on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] (a linen, embroidered cloth). The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).\n\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that [[Marjorie Chibnall]] says \"writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Chibnall|first=Marjorie|authorlink = Marjorie Chibnall|publisher=Blackwell publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4051-4965-5|location=Oxford|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref> In the course of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The [[Anglo-Norman language]] became distinct from the [[Latin language]], something that was the subject of some humour by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see [[Old English]]) and influenced it, helping (along with the [[Norse language]] of the earlier [[Danelaw|Anglo-Norse]] settlers and the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] used by the church) in the development of [[Middle English]]. It in turn evolved into [[Modern English]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Ireland|Normans in Ireland}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Norman keep in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[County Meath]]]]\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves (slogan)|more Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and also built many fine castles and settlements, including [[Trim Castle]] and [[Dublin Castle]]. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their [[surnames]]. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County [[Wexford]], where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry. Except for the native surname Fitzpatrick, a [[gallicisation]] of Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig/\u00d3 Maol Ph\u00e1draig. Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include [[FitzGerald dynasty|Fitzgerald]], FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, [[Fitzmaurice]]. Families bearing such surnames as [[Barry (name)|Barry (de Barra)]] and [[House of Burke|De B\u00farca (Burke)]] are also of Norman extraction.\n\n===Scotland===\n{{See also|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scoto-Norman}}\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Edgar Atheling]], eventually fled to Scotland. King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] married Edgar's sister [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nNormans went into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings, such as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], as well as founding a considerable number of the [[Scottish clan]]s. King [[David I of Scotland]], whose elder brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] had married [[Sybilla of Normandy]], was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], part of the process some scholars call the \"[[Davidian Revolution]]\". Having spent time at the court of [[Henry I of England]] (married to David's sister [[Edith of Scotland|Maud of Scotland]]), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]]. The Norman-derived [[feudal]] system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names [[Bruce (surname)|Bruce]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], Ramsay, Fraser, Rose, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and [[Gordon (surname)|Gordon]] to name but a few, and including the later royal [[House of Stewart]], can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\n===Wales===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Wales|Cambro-Norman}}\n[[File:Mms chepstow castle from river wye.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Chepstow Castle]] in Wales, built by [[William fitzOsbern]] in 1067]]\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with [[Wales]]. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]], [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Hugh, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]] in [[Cheshire]]. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as ''baron'' (''barwn''), first entered [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at that time.\n\n===On crusade===\n{{See also|Principality of Antioch|Bohemund I of Antioch|Richard the Lion-Heart}}\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the [[First Crusade]] carved out a Norman [[Principality of Antioch|principality in Antioch]]. They were major foreign participants in the [[Reconquista]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 1018, [[Roger I of Tosny|Roger de Tosny]] travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from [[Moorish]] lands, but failed. In 1064, during the [[War of Barbastro]], [[William of Montreuil]] led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of [[Amalfi]] were joined by [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the ''de facto'' leader of the Crusade during its passage through [[Asia Minor]]. After the successful [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and he worked for the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader kingdom]] in [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and the region of [[Galilee]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Anglo-Norman conquest of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}[[File:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Illuminated manuscript showing king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] authorizing [[Guy de Lusignan]] to take [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]\nThe conquest of [[Cyprus]] by the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] forces of the [[Third Crusade]] opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under [[Western Europe]]an domination for the following 380 years. Although not part of a planned operation, the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected.\n\nIn April 1191, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] left [[Messina]] with a large fleet in order to reach [[Acre (city)|Acre]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 131}} But a storm dispersed the fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc\u00e9e Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship.

Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Richard left for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 5 June, with his allies.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, [[Richard de Camville]] and [[Robert of Thornham|Robert de Thornham]], as governors of Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]. The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]], whom he had brought from [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned [[King of Cyprus]], and Berengaria Queen of England and [[List of Cypriot consorts|Queen of Cyprus]] as well.\n\n[[File:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Norman expeditionary ship depicted in the chronicle ''[[Le Canarien]]'' (1490)]]\n\nThe rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed. The island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the [[Knights Templar]] and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy de Lusignan and became a [[Kingdom of Cyprus|stable feudal kingdom]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} It was only in 1489 that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] acquired full control of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|fall of Famagusta]] in 1571.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}}\n\n===Canary Islands===\n{{see also|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}\nBetween 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble [[Jean de Bethencourt]]<ref name=\"EB1911Bethencourt\">{{EB1911|wstitle=B\u00e9thencourt, Jean de|volume=3}}</ref> and the [[Poitevine]] [[Gadifer de la Salle]] conquered the [[Canary Islands|Canarian islands]] of [[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]] and [[El Hierro]] off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by [[Castilian people|Castilian]] colonists.\n\nBethencourt took the title of [[King of the Canary Islands]], as vassal to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In 1418, Jean's nephew [[Maciot de Bethencourt]] sold the rights to the islands to [[Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla]].\n\n==Culture==\n===Norman law===\n{{main|Norman law|Clameur de haro}}\nThe [[Custom (law)|customary law]] of [[Normandy]] was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. Norman customary law was transcribed in two [[Coutume|customaries]] in [[Latin]] by two judges for use by them and their colleagues:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/cultures/GB_FR/culture1_7.htm|title=Norman customary law|website=Mondes-normands.caen.fr|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> These are the ''Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier'' (''Very ancient customary''), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the ''Grand coutumier de Normandie'' (''Great customary of Normandy'', originally ''Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali''), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Norman architecture}}\n[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|A quintessential Norman keep: the [[Tower of London|White Tower]] in [[London]]]]\n\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque idiom]] to England, Italy and Ireland, and the [[encastellation]] of these regions with [[keep]]s in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded [[arch]]es, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and precedes the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]]. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Lombardic architecture|Lombard]], and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture#Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture|Norman-Arab architecture]] within the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref name=\"Sicily\" />\n\n===Visual arts===\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the [[Cluniac reform]] of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of [[scriptoria]] and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Bec-de-Mortagne|Bec]], [[Saint-Ouen, Rouen|Saint-Ouen]], [[Saint-Evroul]], and [[Saint-Wandrille]]. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"[[Winchester]] school\", which channeled a pure [[Carolingian art]]istic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\n[[File:Lion, Norman Italy 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bronze lion sculpture attributed to an [[Italo-Norman]] artist. Now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion]] in the 16th century and the [[French Revolution]] in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which is not a [[tapestry]] but a work of [[embroidery]]. It was commissioned by [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] and first [[Earl of Kent]], employing natives from [[Kent]] who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]].\n\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as [[stonework]] or [[metalwork]], such as [[capital (column)|capitals]] and [[baptismal font]]s. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of [[ivory]]work in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. The intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:David on harp.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from [[Saint-Evroul]] depicting [[King David]] on the lyre (or harp) in the middle of the back of the initial 'B']]\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of [[classical music]] in the 11th century. [[F\u00e9camp Abbey]] and [[Saint-Evroul Abbey]] were centres of musical production and education. At F\u00e9camp, under two Italian abbots, [[William of Volpiano]] and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at F\u00e9camp, the [[Staff (music)|staff]], around which [[neume]]s were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot [[Isembard of La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont|Isembard]], [[La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont]] became a centre of musical composition.\n\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot [[Robert de Grantmesnil]], several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at [[Lamezia Terme#Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia]].

In the same source, his stories are analysed as lacking the subtlety and psychological depth found in the writings of Edgar Allan Poe but they are described as amusing and entertaining.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n\nIn 1803 Mudford published his first novel, ''Augustus and Mary'' also known as ''The Maid of Buttermere: A Domestic Tale''. Following that, Mudford made a living occupied by more mundane work such as translating foreign works and editing essays and other literary works. He also wrote his second novel ''Nubilia in Search of a Husband'' which was his response to the popular ''[[Coelebs in Search of a Wife]]'' by [[Hannah More]] and was clearly aimed at capitalising on the market success of the novel by More.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n        \nAs a young man Mudford showed his ambition by contacting influential and powerful men. When only seventeen, Mudford approached the producer of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] [[John Philip Kemble]], with the suggestion of issuing a pamphlet in his honour. Years later this was followed by a proposal for a theatrical play which was rejected by Kemble. The play itself was subsequently lost. Mudford, at 18, followed the [[Duke of Kent]] to [[Gibraltar]] as his assistant secretary.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/> Mudford was a Tory and a supporter of the foreign minister of the era [[George Canning]].<ref name=\"BookRags\"/> Mudford was also a close friend and supporter of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Samuel Taylor]].<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n[[File:Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine XXV 1829.jpg|thumb|180px|Mudford was a frequent contributor to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]\nAt the age of forty he lost a lot of money in speculative ventures in the stock market and had to start again financially. He worked very hard and accepted an offer from the conservative party in East Kent to become the editor of the ''[[Kentish Observer]]''. He finally settled in [[Canterbury]] and eventually became the owner of the ''Kentish Observer''. He contributed regularly to ''Blackwood's Magazine'' and sometimes he wrote a story, a review, and a political paper in the same issue. His series of ''First and Last'' stories were very popular as were his contributions under the nickname of ''The Silent Member''. In 1841 Mudford moved back to London where he succeeded [[Theodore Hook]] as editor of the [[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull magazine]] all the while maintaining his connection with the ''Kentish Observer''. During this period his health started declining but he still kept a busy work schedule. In 1848 he wrote his last article on the topic of the [[French revolution]] which appeared in the ''John Bull'' on 5 March of the same year.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMudford while employed at the Morning Chronicle met [[William Hazlitt]] who was also working as a journalist there. A rivalry developed between the two and Hazlitt became one of Mudford's detractors. In Hazlitt's essay in ''[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]'' published in 1821 under the title ''Coffee-House Politicians'', Roger Kirkpatrick, one of Hazlitt's friends, is described as a Mudford impersonator. In the essay Mudford was described by Hazlitt as a ''Contemplative Man'' ''who wrote an answer to Coelebs''. Hazlitt then goes on to describe him as ''a man made of fleecy hosiery'' and ''fat, pert, and dull as it was possible to be''. Hazlitt thought that Mudford was a [[political hack]]-type journalist and a ''government tool'' and he often criticised and ridiculed him.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n \n[[Charles Dickens]] used a parody of Mudford's name when he wrote the ''Mudfog Sketches'', creating the town of Mudfog as a parody of [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\nMudford was also a founder member of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] and was among those who voted to create the organisation on 16 June 1824 at [[Old Slaughter's Coffee House]], London.<ref>Kathryn Shevelow, ''For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movement'' (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), p 269.

His second son, [[William Heseltine Mudford]], became the editor of the ''Standard'' in 1894.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In Mudford's obituary, appearing in the June 1848 issue of [[Gentleman's Magazine]], his abilities as the editor of the Courier were praised.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/> The entry on Mudford for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography appeared in 2004, written by David Finkelstein .<ref name=\"Oxford DNB\"/>\n\n==Selected works==\n*''A Critical Examination of the Writings of Richard Cumberland'', Sherwood Pub., Neely, and Jones, 1812\n*''A critical enquiry'' (1802), Garland Pub., 1974\n*''The life of Richard Cumberland, esq.'', Sherwood, Neely and Jones Pub., 1812\n*''A critical enquiry into the writings of Samuel Johnson in which it is shewn that the pictures of life contained in the Rambler, and other publications of that celebrated writer have a dangerous tendency''.

In the aftermath of his departure the Courier lost readership and eventually closed while attempts at inviting Mudford back at the journal proved unsuccessful.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMudford has been described by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] as an author who \"loves to play at cherry-pit with Satan.\"; a [[Shakespeare]]an expression used to indicate familiarity with the Devil.<ref name=\"EDITH BIRKHEAD\">[https://archive.org/stream/taleofterrorstud00birkuoft/taleofterrorstud00birkuoft_djvu.txt THE TALE OF TERROR Study of the Gothic Romance] BY EDITH BIRKHEAD M.A. ASSISTANT LECTURER IN ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL FORMERLY NOB ftE FELLOW IN THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL LONDON CONSTABLE 6f COMPANY LTD.1921 GLASGOW: PRINTED AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS BY ROBERT MACLEHOSB AND CO.

Collins (academic)|John H. Collins]], analysing the influence of Mudford's work, comments that \"the Shroud story is a first rate piece of writing comparable to the best half-dozen works by Poe\" and that \"it should not just be dismissed as a mere potboiler which the genius of Poe transformed.\"<ref name=\"Collins\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ccwYzE4w9kIC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=Iron+shroud+Mudford&source=bl&ots=EEmkwMqwqW&sig=Ad7hrrLhrVrUAWBiXHXmvDvfpuw&hl=en&ei=rPyBS_z5LeWutge7r-DqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CB0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=Iron%20shroud%20Mudford&f=false American Notes & Queries \u2013 a Journal for the Curious 1943\u201344 By Hesperides]</ref> He goes on to mention that he thinks many readers mistakenly think that the \"Iron Shroud\" is one of Poe's works thus further strengthening Poe's reputation by attributing to him a story that he actually plagiarised.<ref name=\"Collins\"/> In the ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' Mudford's writing is described as vigorous while as a writer he is called a master at creating atmosphere. In the same source, his stories are analysed as lacking the subtlety and psychological depth found in the writings of Edgar Allan Poe but they are described as amusing and entertaining.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n\nIn 1803 Mudford published his first novel, ''Augustus and Mary'' also known as ''The Maid of Buttermere: A Domestic Tale''. Following that, Mudford made a living occupied by more mundane work such as translating foreign works and editing essays and other literary works. He also wrote his second novel ''Nubilia in Search of a Husband'' which was his response to the popular ''[[Coelebs in Search of a Wife]]'' by [[Hannah More]] and was clearly aimed at capitalising on the market success of the novel by More.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n        \nAs a young man Mudford showed his ambition by contacting influential and powerful men. When only seventeen, Mudford approached the producer of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] [[John Philip Kemble]], with the suggestion of issuing a pamphlet in his honour. Years later this was followed by a proposal for a theatrical play which was rejected by Kemble. The play itself was subsequently lost. Mudford, at 18, followed the [[Duke of Kent]] to [[Gibraltar]] as his assistant secretary.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/> Mudford was a Tory and a supporter of the foreign minister of the era [[George Canning]].<ref name=\"BookRags\"/> Mudford was also a close friend and supporter of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Samuel Taylor]].<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n[[File:Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine XXV 1829.jpg|thumb|180px|Mudford was a frequent contributor to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]\nAt the age of forty he lost a lot of money in speculative ventures in the stock market and had to start again financially. He worked very hard and accepted an offer from the conservative party in East Kent to become the editor of the ''[[Kentish Observer]]''. He finally settled in [[Canterbury]] and eventually became the owner of the ''Kentish Observer''. He contributed regularly to ''Blackwood's Magazine'' and sometimes he wrote a story, a review, and a political paper in the same issue. His series of ''First and Last'' stories were very popular as were his contributions under the nickname of ''The Silent Member''. In 1841 Mudford moved back to London where he succeeded [[Theodore Hook]] as editor of the [[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull magazine]] all the while maintaining his connection with the ''Kentish Observer''. During this period his health started declining but he still kept a busy work schedule. In 1848 he wrote his last article on the topic of the [[French revolution]] which appeared in the ''John Bull'' on 5 March of the same year.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMudford while employed at the Morning Chronicle met [[William Hazlitt]] who was also working as a journalist there. A rivalry developed between the two and Hazlitt became one of Mudford's detractors. In Hazlitt's essay in ''[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]'' published in 1821 under the title ''Coffee-House Politicians'', Roger Kirkpatrick, one of Hazlitt's friends, is described as a Mudford impersonator. In the essay Mudford was described by Hazlitt as a ''Contemplative Man'' ''who wrote an answer to Coelebs''. Hazlitt then goes on to describe him as ''a man made of fleecy hosiery'' and ''fat, pert, and dull as it was possible to be''. Hazlitt thought that Mudford was a [[political hack]]-type journalist and a ''government tool'' and he often criticised and ridiculed him.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\n \n[[Charles Dickens]] used a parody of Mudford's name when he wrote the ''Mudfog Sketches'', creating the town of Mudfog as a parody of [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].<ref name=\"BookRags\"/>\nMudford was also a founder member of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] and was among those who voted to create the organisation on 16 June 1824 at [[Old Slaughter's Coffee House]], London.<ref>Kathryn Shevelow, ''For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movement'' (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), p 269. Also see Arthur W. Moss, ''Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA'' (London: Cassell, 1961), p 23.</ref>\n\nMudford died at 5 Harrington Square, Hampstead Road, on 10 March 1848, leaving a widow and eight\nchildren. His second son, [[William Heseltine Mudford]], became the editor of the ''Standard'' in 1894.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In Mudford's obituary, appearing in the June 1848 issue of [[Gentleman's Magazine]], his abilities as the editor of the Courier were praised.<ref name=\"BookRags\"/> The entry on Mudford for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography appeared in 2004, written by David Finkelstein .<ref name=\"Oxford DNB\"/>\n\n==Selected works==\n*''A Critical Examination of the Writings of Richard Cumberland'', Sherwood Pub., Neely, and Jones, 1812\n*''A critical enquiry'' (1802), Garland Pub., 1974\n*''The life of Richard Cumberland, esq.'', Sherwood, Neely and Jones Pub., 1812\n*''A critical enquiry into the writings of Samuel Johnson in which it is shewn that the pictures of life contained in the Rambler, and other publications of that celebrated writer have a dangerous tendency''.
