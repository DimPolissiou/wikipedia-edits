In July, an army under the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Duke of Brunswick]] and composed mostly of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] joined the Austrian side and invaded France. As the army advanced, Paris went into a state of hysteria, especially after the Duke issued the \"[[Brunswick Manifesto]]\" on 25 July. His avowed aim was\n<blockquote>to put an end to the anarchy in the interior of France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the altar, to reestablish the legal power, to restore to the king the security and the liberty of which he is now deprived and to place him in a position to exercise once more the legitimate authority which belongs to him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arno J.

The next day the insurrectionists [[10 August (French Revolution)|stormed the Tuileries Palace]]. King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was imprisoned with the royal family, and his authority as King was suspended by the [[National Legislative Assembly (France)|\nLegislative Assembly]]. The next day the royalist press was silenced. A provisional executive (Conseil ex\u00e9cutif) was named and busied itself with reorganizing or solving questions concerning the police, justice, the army, navy and paper money but actual power now rested with the new revolutionary Commune, whose strength resided in the mobilized and armed ''[[sans-culottes]]'', the lower classes of Paris, and ''[[f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s]]'', armed volunteers from the provinces that had arrived at the end of July. The 48 sections of Paris were equipped with munitions from the plundered arsenals in the days before the assault, substituting for the 60 National Guard battalions. Supported by a new armed force, the Commune dominated the Legislative Assembly and its decisions.<ref>Bergeron, Louis, ''Le Monde et son Histoire'', Paris, 1970, Volume VII, Chapter VII, p. 324</ref> The Commune pushed through several measures: universal suffrage was adopted, the civilian population was armed, all remnants of noble privileges were abolished and the [[Biens nationaux|properties]] of the ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]'' were sold. These events meant a change of direction from the political and constitutional perspective of the [[Girondists]] to a more social approach given by the Commune as expressed by [[Pierre-Joseph Cambon]]: \"To reject with more efficacy the defenders of despotism, we have to address the fortunes of the poor, we have to associate the Revolution with this multitude that possesses nothing, we have to convert the people to the cause.\"<ref>L. Bergeron (1970), p. 325.</ref>\n\nBesides these measures, the Commune engaged in a policy of political repression of all suspected counter-revolutionary activities.

In July, an army under the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Duke of Brunswick]] and composed mostly of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] joined the Austrian side and invaded France. As the army advanced, Paris went into a state of hysteria, especially after the Duke issued the \"[[Brunswick Manifesto]]\" on 25 July. His avowed aim was\n<blockquote>to put an end to the anarchy in the interior of France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the altar, to reestablish the legal power, to restore to the king the security and the liberty of which he is now deprived and to place him in a position to exercise once more the legitimate authority which belongs to him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arno J.

The next day the insurrectionists [[10 August (French Revolution)|stormed the Tuileries Palace]]. King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was imprisoned with the royal family, and his authority as King was suspended by the [[National Legislative Assembly (France)|\nLegislative Assembly]]. The next day the royalist press was silenced. A provisional executive (Conseil ex\u00e9cutif) was named and busied itself with reorganizing or solving questions concerning the police, justice, the army, navy and paper money but actual power now rested with the new revolutionary Commune, whose strength resided in the mobilized and armed ''[[sans-culottes]]'', the lower classes of Paris, and ''[[f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s]]'', armed volunteers from the provinces that had arrived at the end of July. The 48 sections of Paris were equipped with munitions from the plundered arsenals in the days before the assault, substituting for the 60 National Guard battalions. Supported by a new armed force, the Commune dominated the Legislative Assembly and its decisions.<ref>Bergeron, Louis, ''Le Monde et son Histoire'', Paris, 1970, Volume VII, Chapter VII, p. 324</ref> The Commune pushed through several measures: universal suffrage was adopted, the civilian population was armed, all remnants of noble privileges were abolished and the [[Biens nationaux|properties]] of the ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]'' were sold. These events meant a change of direction from the political and constitutional perspective of the [[Girondists]] to a more social approach given by the Commune as expressed by [[Pierre-Joseph Cambon]]: \"To reject with more efficacy the defenders of despotism, we have to address the fortunes of the poor, we have to associate the Revolution with this multitude that possesses nothing, we have to convert the people to the cause.\"<ref>L. Bergeron (1970), p. 325.</ref>\n\nBesides these measures, the Commune engaged in a policy of political repression of all suspected counter-revolutionary activities.

In 1906, the Bank of Nova Scotia opened a branch in [[Havana]], Cuba, followed by a branch in [[New York City]] in the following year. In 1910, the bank opened a branch in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].

The bank also saw growth in Cuba, with five branches in Havana, and one branch each in [[Camag\u00fcey]], [[Cienfuegos]], [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]], and [[Santiago de Cuba]] by 1931.\n\nDuring the mid 20th century, the bank grew not only in size but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. Major changes include:<ref name=\"FU_history\"/> Following the passage of the ''[[National Housing Act (Canada)|National Housing Act]]'', the Bank of Nova Scotia created a mortgage department in 1954. Further changes to the ''Bank Act of 1954'' in 1958 led to the bank introducing its consumer credit program.\n\nThe bank's branches in Cuba continued to operate until 1960, when the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba, and the Bank of Nova Scotia withdrew its services from all eight branches. The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.<ref name=\"FU_history\"/> During the 1960s, the Bank of Nova Scotia became the first Canadian bank to appoint women as bank managers, with the first appointed on 11 September 1961.<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/> In the next year, the bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.<ref name=\"FU_history\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the Bank of Nova Scotia adopted ''Scotiabank'' as its worldwide brand name.

The late 1980s and 1990s saw the bank acquire several firms, including McLeod Young Weir Ltd  brokerage firm in 1988, and Montreal Trustco Inc. in 1994. In 1997, the bank acquired National Trustco Inc. for C$1.25&nbsp;billion.

Buchan then goes on to consider the aftermath, Montrose\u2019s new campaign in the North for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] after his father\u2019s [[Execution of Charles I|execution in 1649]], and his defeat, betrayal, trial and finally his own execution.<ref name=\u201cJBSoc\u201d/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nAs a scholarly edition, ''Montrose'' was widely praised.<ref name=\u201cJBSoc\u201d/> The biography is, said one later critic, presented with a reverent, dignified but not exaggerated dramatic power;<ref name=\u201cJBSoc\u201d/> while another praised Buchan\u2019s research while expressing some regret at the loss of \u201cgood sharp phrases\u201d from his earlier work.<ref name=\u201cDaniell179\u201d/>\n\n[[A.

As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works, as well as those of others.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\", \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" and \"[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]\".\n\nCoward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nCoward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London.

The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles.<ref>Hoare, pp. 89\u201391</ref> The reviews were good: \"Mr No\u00ebl Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is.

During the run of ''The Vortex'', Coward met [[John C. Wilson|Jack Wilson]], an American stockbroker (later a director and producer), who became his business manager and lover.

It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family.<ref>Hoare, pp. 42\u201343</ref> By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in ''The Times'' as a \"dazzling achievement; like ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery.\"<ref name=timesobit /> By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: ''The Vortex'', ''Fallen Angels'', ''Hay Fever'' and ''[[On with the Dance (musical)|On with the Dance]]''.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 107</ref> Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'.

He wrote it as his swan song as a stage actor: \"I would like to act once more before I fold my bedraggled wings.\"<ref>Coward, ''Plays, Five'', introduction, unnumbered page</ref> The trilogy gained glowing reviews and did good box office business in the UK.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 375</ref> In one of the three plays, ''[[A Song at Twilight]]'', Coward abandoned his customary reticence on the subject and played an explicitly homosexual character. The daring piece earned Coward new critical praise.<ref>\"Noel Coward's Skeleton Feast\", ''The Times'', 15 April 1966, p. 16</ref> He intended to star in the trilogy on Broadway but was too ill to travel. Only two of the ''Suite in Three Keys'' plays were performed in New York, with the title changed to ''No\u00ebl Coward in Two Keys'', starring [[Hume Cronyn]].<ref>Hoare, p. 502</ref>\n\nCoward won new popularity in several notable films later in his career, such as ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), ''[[Our Man in Havana (film)|Our Man in Havana]]'' (1959), ''[[Bunny Lake Is Missing]]'' (1965), ''[[Boom!

March 1973) was an English playwright, composer, director, actor and singer, known for his wit, flamboyance, and what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called \"a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise\".<ref name=Time1969>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941819-2,00.html \"Noel Coward at 70\",] ''Time'', 26 December 1969, accessed 2 May 2011</ref>\n\nCoward attended a dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage d\u00e9but at the age of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works, as well as those of others.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\", \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" and \"[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]\".\n\nCoward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nCoward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (1856{{ndash}}1937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (1863{{ndash}}1954), daughter of [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Veitch, Henry Gordon|Henry Gordon Veitch]], a captain and surveyor in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Morley (1974), p. 2</ref> Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]].<ref>Hoare, p. 2</ref> No\u00ebl Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 at the age of six.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 3</ref> Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor.<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 4, 8 and 67</ref> Coward was bitten by the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven.

This seemed to dispose of all argument. I was a talented boy, God knows, and, when washed and smarmed down a bit, passably attractive. There appeared to be no earthly reason why Miss Lila Field shouldn't jump at me, and we both believed that she would be a fool indeed to miss such a magnificent opportunity.<ref>Coward (''Present Indicative''), pp. 21\u201322</ref>}}\n\n[[File:coward Hawtrey 1911.jpg|left|thumb|Coward ''(left)'' with [[Lydia Bilbrook]] ''(centre)'' and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1858)|Charles Hawtrey]], 1911]]\nThe leading actor-manager [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1858)|Charles Hawtrey]], whom the young Coward idolised and from whom he learned a great deal about the theatre, cast him in the children's play ''[[Where the Rainbow Ends]]''.

The Nizam was the highest-ranking prince in India, was one of only five princes [[salute state|entitled to a 21-gun salute]], held the unique title of \"Nizam\", and was titled \"[[Exalted Highness|His Exalted Highness]]\" and \"Faithful Ally of the [[The Crown|British Crown]]\"{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Early years (1911 to 1918) ===\n\nIn 1908, three years before the Nizam's coronation, the city of Hyderabad was [[Great Musi Flood of 1908|struck by a major flood]] that resulted in the death of thousands.

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain {{INR}} 10 million in return.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson [[Mir Najaf Ali Khan]] stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment. English-language newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'' submitted a [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information]] query to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) in 2018 asking for information on the investment and the final beneficiary. However, the RBI refused to provide this information, citing \"unwarranted invasion of the privacy\" clause of the RTI law.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\"/>\n\n== Operation Polo and forced abdication ==\n\n[[File:OsmanNehruJN.jpg|thumb|175px|(From left to right): Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Nizam and Major [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]] after Hyderabad's accession to India]]\n\n{{Main|Indian annexation of Hyderabad}}\n\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the country was partitioned into [[India]] and Pakistan.

The Nizam ruled over more than 16 million people and {{convert|82698|sqmi|km2}} of territory when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein. The Nizam cited the [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakars]] as evidence that the people of the state were opposed to any agreement with India.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nUltimately the new Indian government decided to invade and capture Hyderabad in 1948, in an operation code named [[Operation Polo]].
