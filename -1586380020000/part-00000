His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946).

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank.

Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.

In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde. In ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n===Relationship with actors===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor= #E0E6F8\n |quote =&nbsp;...

They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea.

He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said 'That's not acting.

He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock four times,<ref>{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}</ref> and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Writing, storyboards and production===\nHitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.<ref>{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}</ref> He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:\n\n{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|title=Hitchcock: \"Never mess about with a dead body\u2014you may be one&nbsp;....|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 December 1969}}</ref>}}\n\nHitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.<ref>Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{Citation|last=Pallant|first=Chris|title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding|year=2015|work=Storyboarding: A Critical History|pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris|series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6|isbn=978-1-137-02760-3|last2=Price|first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]\nThis view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. \n\nAccording to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

For instance, Clare Greet was also in ''Lord Camber's Ladies'' (1932), which Hitchcock produced, as were [[Benita Hume]] and [[A. Bromley Davenport]], who had been in ''Easy Virtue'' (1928) and ''Jamaica Inn'' (1939) respectively. Leslie Banks also starred in ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' (1935), which Hitchcock directed in its earliest stages. Meanwhile, other recurring actors featured in other Hitchcock projects, as with Peter Lorre, who also appeared in two episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents''.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of Alfred

His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946).

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\".<ref name=Spoto1999p267>The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.

In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde. In ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n===Relationship with actors===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor= #E0E6F8\n |quote =&nbsp;...

They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea.

He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said 'That's not acting.

He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock four times,<ref>{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}</ref> and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Writing, storyboards and production===\nHitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.<ref>{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}</ref> He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:\n\n{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|title=Hitchcock: \"Never mess about with a dead body\u2014you may be one&nbsp;....|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 December 1969}}</ref>}}\n\nHitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.<ref>Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{Citation|last=Pallant|first=Chris|title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding|year=2015|work=Storyboarding: A Critical History|pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris|series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6|isbn=978-1-137-02760-3|last2=Price|first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]\nThis view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. \n\nAccording to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

For instance, Clare Greet was also in ''Lord Camber's Ladies'' (1932), which Hitchcock produced, as were [[Benita Hume]] and [[A. Bromley Davenport]], who had been in ''Easy Virtue'' (1928) and ''Jamaica Inn'' (1939) respectively. Leslie Banks also starred in ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' (1935), which Hitchcock directed in its earliest stages. Meanwhile, other recurring actors featured in other Hitchcock projects, as with Peter Lorre, who also appeared in two episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents''.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of Alfred

It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Joe Don Baker]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Gregory Peck]] in his final theatrical film role. In addition to Mitchum and Peck, [[Martin Balsam]] cameos in the remake; all three starred in the original film. The film tells the story of a convicted rapist, who, mostly by using his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous loopholes, seeks vengeance against a former [[public defender]], whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment because of the purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial.\n\n''Cape Fear'' marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro]]. The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success. It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Juliette Lewis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nSam Bowden ([[Nick Nolte]]) is a lawyer living in North Carolina with his wife Leigh ([[Jessica Lange]]) and teenage daughter Danielle ([[Juliette Lewis]]). [[Max Cady]] ([[Robert De Niro]]), a former client whom Sam failed to defend, is released from prison after 14 years; Cady was tried for rape and battery of a young woman and, appalled by the attack, Sam buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. \n\nCady, who has studied law in prison but unsuccessfully appealed his conviction several times, tracks Sam down and begins to terrorise the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Cady arrested but the police say there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady intentionally meets Sam's work colleague Lori. He later violently attacks and rapes her but she refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Sam hires a private investigator, Kerserk, to follow Cady.\n\nCady approaches Danielle at school by impersonating her new drama teacher, and they kiss. Sam warns Cady to leave him and his family alone or suffer the consequences, a conversation that Cady secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Sam also hires three men to beat Cady; as Sam watches from afar, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Cady then uses the recording of Sam's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam.\n\nKersek assumes that Cady may try to enter the Bowden house while he believes Sam is out of town; the family fake his departure and hide in the house, hoping that Cady will break in so that he can be shot in self-defense. Cady kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and impersonates her to ambush and kill Kersek. Horrified after discovering the bodies, Sam, Leigh, and Danielle flee to their houseboat docked upstate along [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] river. \n\nCady, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danielle while making Sam watch. Danielle sprays Cady with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Cady clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm, a badly burned and deranged Cady confronts Sam, putting him on a [[mock trial]] to condemn him for withholding the specific evidence that would have given him a lighter sentence in jail. Despite Sam's insistence that his crime was too heinous for that evidence to be taken into account, Cady berates him for failing to properly do his duty as a lawyer. \n\nThe storm eventually knocks Cady off of his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam then uses Cady's handcuffs to shackle Cady to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Cady away and he drowns. Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danielle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as [[Max Cady]]\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as Sam Bowden\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Leigh Bowden\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Danielle Bowden\n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Claude Kersek\n*[[Robert Mitchum]] as Lt.

Webb (writer)|James R. Webb]], which was an adaptation from the novel ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]'' by [[John D. MacDonald]].\n\nIt was originally developed by [[Steven Spielberg]], who eventually decided it was too violent and traded it to Scorsese to get back ''[[Schindler's List]]'', which Scorsese had decided not to make. Spielberg stayed on as a producer, through his [[Amblin Entertainment]], but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEED9113FF933A25752C1A967958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM; Martin Scorsese Ventures Back To 'Cape Fear' | date=1991-11-10}}</ref>\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted [[Harrison Ford]] to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted [[Bill Murray]] to portray Cady.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Intense Facts About ''Cape Fear''|date=November 16, 2016|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88173/15-intense-facts-about-cape-fear|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNick Nolte is taller than Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until De Niro appeared to be the stronger man.

As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J. Lee Thompson]] specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had [[Bernard Hermann]] write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews by critics, with praise garnered towards its performances, direction, cinematography and editing. It received a 73% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the film aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 7.06/10. The consensus reads, \"Smart and stylish, ''Cape Fear'' is a gleefully mainstream shocker from Martin Scorsese, with a terrifying Robert De Niro performance.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1037581-cape_fear/ |title=''Cape Fear'' at RottenTomatoes.com |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 73 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cape-fear |title=Cape Fear Reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2016-06-11}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars, commenting: \"''Cape Fear'' is impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions.

They also pay homage to another Robert Mitchum film ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' in which Sideshow Bob's knuckles (scaled down for a cartoon character with one fewer finger on each hand) say \"Luv\" (Love) and \"H\u0101t\" (Hate, with the diacritical mark providing the long vowel).\n\nIn 1995, professional wrestler [[Dan Spivey]] made his [[WWE]] (then WWF) debut under the ring name, Walylon Mercy, with his [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] based on De Niro's portrayal of Max Cady. However, he only lasted a few months with the company as Spivey was forced into retirement due to a buildup of previous injuries, and the character was abandoned. In 2013, WWE debuted [[Bray Wyatt]], another character partly based on not just De Niro's portrayal, but also Waylon Mercy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critics, not fans, should bite their tongues|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2013/07/15/pf-20975591.html|publisher=Slam!

A close up, sharing the same scary score of the movie, Uncle Leo is seen with \u201cJerry\u201d & \u201cHello\u201d tattooed on each hand. It's a clear reference to Robert De Niro's character in Cape Fear.\n\nIn the ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 1)#Episodes|Ricksy Business]]\", Lucy (the deranged maid who tries to rape Jerry) is shown clinging to the underside chassis of their car as they drive home, maniacally shouting \"Ha, I'm doing like in ''Cape Fear''!\"\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nIn the movie, Danielle is pictured reading [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s 1929 coming-of-age novel, ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]].''\n\nKersek tells Sam he saw Cady at the public library reading [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s classic philosophical novel ''[[Thus Spake Zarathustra]].''\n\nPretending to be Danielle's new drama teacher, Cady calls Danielle on the phone. After a short conversation, he plays [[Aretha Franklin]]'s single \"[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]].\"\n\nAlone with Danielle in the school's theater, Cady alludes to [[Henry Miller]]'s trilogy ''[[The Rosy Crucifixion]]'', which contains the books ''Plexus,'' ''Nexus,'' and ''Sexus.'' Danielle says she read parts of ''[[Tropic of Cancer]].''\n\nCady tells Sam he will teach him \"the meaning of commitment.\" He tells Sam to \"check out the [[Bible]], counselor. Look between [[Book of Esther|Esther]] and [[Psalms]].\" After staging his departure at the airport, Sam returns home covertly with Leigh and Danielle, and later discovers Cady was referring to the [[Book of Job]].\n\nCady quotes a translation of the 17th century priest, physician, mystic, and poet, [[Angelus Silesius]], saying: {{cquote|\n\n:I am like God, and God like me.\n:I am as Large as God, He is as small as I.\n:He cannot above me, nor I beneath him, be.\n|}}\n\nCady alludes to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', saying he is [[Virgil]] guiding Sam through the Ninth Circle of Hell, the last and lowest circle, reserved for traitors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[List of 1991 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n* [[Night and the City (1992 film)|''Night and the City'']], another remake also starring De Niro and Lange\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9snGGV1X5MC&printsec=frontcover&source=in Machura, Stefan and Robson, Peter, eds.

It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Juliette Lewis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nSam Bowden ([[Nick Nolte]]) is a lawyer living in North Carolina with his wife Leigh ([[Jessica Lange]]) and teenage daughter Danielle ([[Juliette Lewis]]). [[Max Cady]] ([[Robert De Niro]]), a former client whom Sam failed to defend, is released from prison after 14 years; Cady was tried for rape and battery of a young woman and, appalled by the attack, Sam buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. \n\nCady, who has studied law in prison but unsuccessfully appealed his conviction several times, tracks Sam down and begins to terrorise the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Cady arrested but the police say there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady intentionally meets Sam's work colleague Lori. He later violently attacks and rapes her but she refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Sam hires a private investigator, Kerserk, to follow Cady.\n\nCady approaches Danielle at school by impersonating her new drama teacher, and they kiss. Sam warns Cady to leave him and his family alone or suffer the consequences, a conversation that Cady secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Sam also hire three men to beat Cady; as Sam watches from afar, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Cady then uses the recording of Sam's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam.\n\nKersek assumes that Cady may try to enter the Bowden house while he believes Sam is out of town; the family fake his departure and hide in the house, hoping that Cady will break in so that he can be shot in self-defense. Cady kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and impersonates her to ambush and kill Kersek. Horrified after discovering the bodies, Sam, Leigh, and Danielle flee to their houseboat docked upstate along [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] river. \n\nCady, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danielle while making Sam watch. Danielle sprays Cady with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Cady clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm, a badly burned and deranged Cady confronts Sam, putting him on a [[mock trial]] to condemn him for withholding the specific evidence that would have given him a lighter sentence in jail. Despite Sam's insistence that his crime was too heinous for that evidence to be taken into account, Cady berates him for failing to properly do his duty as a lawyer. \n\nThe storm eventually knocks Cady off of his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam then uses Cady's handcuffs to shackle Cady to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Cady away and he drowns. Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danielle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as [[Max Cady]]\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as Sam Bowden\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Leigh Bowden\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Danielle Bowden\n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Claude Kersek\n*[[Robert Mitchum]] as Lt.

As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J.

Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews by critics, with praise garnered towards its performances, direction, cinematography and editing.

The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist [[Sun Tzu]] (\"Master Sun\", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of [[war]]fare and how it applies to [[military strategy]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]]. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the [[Seven Military Classics]] by [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] in 1080. ''The Art of War'' remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare{{sfnp|Smith|1999|p=216}} and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy, lifestyles and beyond.\n\nThe book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.\n\nThe book was translated into French and published in 1772 (re-published in 1782) by the French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot]]. A partial translation into English was attempted by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905 under the title '''''The Book of War'''''. The first annotated English translation was completed and published by [[Lionel Giles]] in 1910.<ref name=\"Lionel Giles 2007. p. 62\">{{Smallcaps|Giles, Lionel}} ''The Art of War by Sun Tzu \u2013 Special Edition''. Special Edition Books. 2007. p. 62.</ref> Military and political leaders such as the Chinese communist revolutionary [[Mao Zedong]], Japanese [[daimy\u014d]] [[Takeda Shingen]], Vietnamese general [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], and American military general [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]] have drawn inspiration from the book.\n\n==History==\n===Text and commentaries===\n''The Art of War'' is traditionally attributed to a military general from the late 6th century BC known as \"Master Sun\" ([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]: \"Sunzi\", earlier \"[[Sun Tzu]]\"), though its earliest parts probably date to at least 100 years later.{{sfnp|Lewis|1999|p=604}} [[Sima Qian]]'s 1st century BC work ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''), the first of China's [[Ershisi shi|24 dynastic histories]], records an early Chinese tradition stating that a text on military matters was written by one \"Sun Wu\" (\u5b6b\u6b66) from the [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]], and that this text had been read and studied by [[King Hel\u00fc of Wu]] (r. 514\u2013495&nbsp;BC).{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  This text was traditionally identified with the received ''Master Sun's Art of War''.  The conventional view{{mdash}}which is still widely held in China{{mdash}}was that Sun Wu was a military theorist from the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (776\u2013471&nbsp;BC) who fled his home state of Qi to the southeastern [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], where he is said to have impressed the king with his ability to train even dainty palace ladies in warfare and to have made Wu's armies powerful enough to challenge their western rivals in the [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]].{{sfnp|Mair|2007|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nThe strategist, poet, and warlord [[Cao Cao]] in the early 3rd century AD authored the earliest known commentary to the ''Art of War''.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  Cao's preface makes clear that he edited the text and removed certain passages, but the extent of his changes were unclear historically.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  ''The Art of War'' appears throughout the bibliographical catalogs of the Chinese dynastic histories, but listings of its divisions and size varied widely.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  In the early 20th century, the Chinese writer and reformer [[Liang Qichao]] theorized that the text was actually written in the 4th century BC by Sunzi's purported descendant [[Sun Bin]], as a number of historical sources mention a military treatise he wrote.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}\n\n===Authorship===\nAround the 12th century, some scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sunzi, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic [[Zuo zhuan|''The Commentary of Zuo'' (''Zuo zhuan'' \u5de6\u50b3)]], which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  The name \"Sun Wu\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b6b\u6b66}}) does not appear in any text prior to the ''Records of the Grand Historian'',{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=9}} and has been suspected to be a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning \"the fugitive warrior\": the surname \"Sun\" is glossed as the related term \"fugitive\" (''x\u00f9n'' {{lang|zh|\u905c}}), while \"Wu\" is the ancient Chinese virtue of \"martial, valiant\" (''w\u01d4'' {{lang|zh|\u6b66}}), which corresponds to Sunzi's role as the hero's ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' in the story of [[Wu Zixu]].{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=10}}  Unlike Sun Wu, Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure \"Sunzi\" through a form of [[euhemerism]].{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=10}}\n\n===Yinqueshan tomb discovery===\nIn 1972, the [[Yinqueshan Han slips]] were discovered in two [[Han dynasty]] (206&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD 220) tombs near the city of [[Linyi]] in [[Shandong Province]].{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=448}}  Among the many [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo slip]] writings contained in the tombs, which had been sealed between 134 and 118&nbsp;BC, respectively were two separate texts, one attributed to \"Sunzi\", corresponding to the received text, and another attributed to Sun Bin, which explains and expands upon the earlier ''The Art of War'' by Sunzi.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=449}}  The Sun Bin text's material overlaps with much of the \"Sunzi\" text, and the two may be \"a single, continuously developing intellectual tradition united under the Sun name\".<ref>[[Mark Edward Lewis]] (2005), quoted in Mair (2007), p. 18.</ref>  This discovery showed that much of the historical confusion was due to the fact that there were two texts that could have been referred to as \"Master Sun's Art of War\", not one.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=449}}  The content of the earlier text is about one-third of the chapters of the modern ''The Art of War'', and their text matches very closely.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=448}}  It is now generally accepted that the earlier ''The Art of War'' was completed sometime between 500 and 430&nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=449}}\n\n==The 13 chapters==\n''The Art of War'' is divided into 13 chapters (or ''pi\u0101n''); the collection is referred to as being one ''zhu\u00e0n'' (\"whole\" or alternatively \"chronicle\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''The Art of War'' chapter names and contents\n|-\n!

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\n\nThis has been more tersely interpreted and condensed into the Chinese modern proverb:\n\n:\u77e5\u5df1\u77e5\u5f7c\uff0c\u767e\u6230\u4e0d\u6b86\u3002 (''Zh\u012b j\u01d0 zh\u012b b\u01d0, b\u01cei zh\u00e0n b\u00f9 d\u00e0i.'')\n:If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win numerous (literally, \"a hundred\") battles without jeopardy.\n\n===English===\nCommon examples can also be found in English use, such as verse 18 in Chapter 1:\n:\u5175\u8005\uff0c\u8a6d\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u80fd\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u7528\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u4e0d\u7528\uff0c\u8fd1\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u9060\uff0c\u9060\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u8fd1\u3002\n:All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.\n\nThis has been abbreviated to its most basic form and condensed into the English modern proverb:\n:All warfare is based on deception.\n\n==Cultural influence==\n===Military and intelligence applications===\nAcross [[East Asia]], ''The Art of War'' was part of the syllabus for potential candidates of military service examinations. \n\nDuring the [[Sengoku period]] (c. 1467\u20131568), the Japanese ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' named [[Takeda Shingen]] (1521\u20131573) is said to have become almost invincible in all battles without relying on [[gun]]s, because he studied ''The Art of War''.<ref name=\"Griffith 2007. p.150\">{{Smallcaps|Griffith, Samuel B.}} ''The Illustrated Art of War''. 2005. Oxford University Press. pp. 17, 141\u201343.</ref>  The book even gave him the inspiration for his famous battle standard \"[[F\u016brinkazan]]\" (Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain), meaning fast as the wind, silent as a forest, ferocious as fire and immovable as a mountain.\n\nThe translator [[Samuel B. Griffith]] offers a chapter on \"Sun Tzu and Mao Tse-Tung\" where ''The Art of War'' is cited as influencing Mao's ''[[On Guerrilla Warfare]]'', ''[[On Protracted War|On the Protracted War]]'' and ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'', and includes Mao's quote: \"We must not belittle the saying in the book of Sun Wu Tzu, the great military expert of ancient China, 'Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a thousand battles without disaster.\"<ref name=\"Griffith 2007. p.150\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], some [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Vietcong]] officers extensively studied ''The Art of War'' and reportedly could recite entire passages from memory. General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] successfully implemented tactics described in ''The Art of War'' during the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] ending major French involvement in Indochina and leading to the accords which partitioned Vietnam into North and South. General V\u00f5, later the main PVA military commander in the [[Vietnam War]], was an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas.<ref name=\"findarticles.com\">McCready, Douglas.

Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle: It gives tips on how to outsmart one's opponent so that physical battle is not necessary. As such, it has found application as a training guide for many competitive endeavors that do not involve actual combat.\n\n''The Art of War'' is mentioned as an influence in the earliest known Chinese collection of stories about fraud (mostly in the realm of commerce), Zhang Yingyu's [[The Book of Swindles]] (''Du pian xin shu'' \u675c\u9a19\u65b0\u66f8, ca. 1617), which dates to the late Ming dynasty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/search-results?keyword=book+of+swindles|title=Search Results &#124; book of swindles &#124; Columbia University Press}}</ref>\n\nMany business books have applied the lessons taken from the book to [[office politics]] and corporate business strategy.<ref>Michaelson, Gerald. \"Sun Tzu: The Art of War for Managers; 50 Strategic Rules.\" Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2001</ref><ref>McNeilly, Mark. \"Sun Tzu and the Art of Business : Six Strategic Principles for Managers.

In the 1987 movie ''[[Wall_Street_(1987_film)|Wall Street]]'', [[Gordon Gekko]] ([[Michael Douglas]]) frequently references The Art of War while dispensing advice to his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Bud Fox ([[Charlie Sheen]]).<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TLCaDbBv_s</ref> In the latter stages of the movie, Fox mentions Sun Tzu himself when describing his plan on trapping Gekko.<ref>https://www.quotes.net/mquote/102540</ref> \n\nIn television, ''The Art of War'' is most famously referenced in ''The Sopranos''.

The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist [[Sun Tzu]] (\"Master Sun\", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of [[war]]fare and how it applies to [[military strategy]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]]. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the [[Seven Military Classics]] by [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] in 1080. ''The Art of War'' remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare{{sfnp|Smith|1999|p=216}} and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy, lifestyles and beyond.\n\nThe book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.\n\nThe book was translated into French and published in 1772 (re-published in 1782) by the French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot]]. A partial translation into English was attempted by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905 under the title '''''The Book of War'''''. The first annotated English translation was completed and published by [[Lionel Giles]] in 1910.<ref name=\"Lionel Giles 2007. p. 62\">{{Smallcaps|Giles, Lionel}} ''The Art of War by Sun Tzu \u2013 Special Edition''. Special Edition Books. 2007. p. 62.</ref> Military and political leaders such as the Chinese communist revolutionary [[Mao Zedong]], Japanese [[daimy\u014d]] [[Takeda Shingen]], Vietnamese general [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], and American military general [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]] have drawn inspiration from the book.\n\n==History==\n===Text and commentaries===\n''The Art of War'' is traditionally attributed to a military general from the late 6th century BC known as \"Master Sun\" ([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]: \"Sunzi\", earlier \"[[Sun Tzu]]\"), though its earliest parts probably date to at least 100 years later.{{sfnp|Lewis|1999|p=604}} [[Sima Qian]]'s 1st century BC work ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''), the first of China's [[Ershisi shi|24 dynastic histories]], records an early Chinese tradition stating that a text on military matters was written by one \"Sun Wu\" (\u5b6b\u6b66) from the [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]], and that this text had been read and studied by [[King Hel\u00fc of Wu]] (r. 514\u2013495&nbsp;BC).{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  This text was traditionally identified with the received ''Master Sun's Art of War''.  The conventional view{{mdash}}which is still widely held in China{{mdash}}was that Sun Wu was a military theorist from the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (776\u2013471&nbsp;BC) who fled his home state of Qi to the southeastern [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], where he is said to have impressed the king with his ability to train even dainty palace ladies in warfare and to have made Wu's armies powerful enough to challenge their western rivals in the [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]].{{sfnp|Mair|2007|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nThe strategist, poet, and warlord [[Cao Cao]] in the early 3rd century AD authored the earliest known commentary to the ''Art of War''.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  Cao's preface makes clear that he edited the text and removed certain passages, but the extent of his changes were unclear historically.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  ''The Art of War'' appears throughout the bibliographical catalogs of the Chinese dynastic histories, but listings of its divisions and size varied widely.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  In the early 20th century, the Chinese writer and reformer [[Liang Qichao]] theorized that the text was actually written in the 4th century BC by Sunzi's purported descendant [[Sun Bin]], as a number of historical sources mention a military treatise he wrote.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}\n\n===Authorship===\nAround the 12th century, some scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sunzi, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic [[Zuo zhuan|''The Commentary of Zuo'' (''Zuo zhuan'' \u5de6\u50b3)]], which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  The name \"Sun Wu\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b6b\u6b66}}) does not appear in any text prior to the ''Records of the Grand Historian'',{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=9}} and has been suspected to be a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning \"the fugitive warrior\": the surname \"Sun\" is glossed as the related term \"fugitive\" (''x\u00f9n'' {{lang|zh|\u905c}}), while \"Wu\" is the ancient Chinese virtue of \"martial, valiant\" (''w\u01d4'' {{lang|zh|\u6b66}}), which corresponds to Sunzi's role as the hero's ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' in the story of [[Wu Zixu]].{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=10}}  Unlike Sun Wu, Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure \"Sunzi\" through a form of [[euhemerism]].{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=10}}\n\n===Yinqueshan tomb discovery===\nIn 1972, the [[Yinqueshan Han slips]] were discovered in two [[Han dynasty]] (206&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD 220) tombs near the city of [[Linyi]] in [[Shandong Province]].{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=448}}  Among the many [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo slip]] writings contained in the tombs, which had been sealed between 134 and 118&nbsp;BC, respectively were two separate texts, one attributed to \"Sunzi\", corresponding to the received text, and another attributed to Sun Bin, which explains and expands upon the earlier ''The Art of War'' by Sunzi.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=449}}  The Sun Bin text's material overlaps with much of the \"Sunzi\" text, and the two may be \"a single, continuously developing intellectual tradition united under the Sun name\".<ref>[[Mark Edward Lewis]] (2005), quoted in Mair (2007), p. 18.</ref>  This discovery showed that much of the historical confusion was due to the fact that there were two texts that could have been referred to as \"Master Sun's Art of War\", not one.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=449}}  The content of the earlier text is about one-third of the chapters of the modern ''The Art of War'', and their text matches very closely.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=448}}  It is now generally accepted that the earlier ''The Art of War'' was completed sometime between 500 and 430&nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=449}}\n\n==The 13 chapters==\n''The Art of War'' is divided into 13 chapters (or ''pi\u0101n''); the collection is referred to as being one ''zhu\u00e0n'' (\"whole\" or alternatively \"chronicle\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''The Art of War'' chapter names and contents\n|-\n!

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\n\nThis has been more tersely interpreted and condensed into the Chinese modern proverb:\n\n:\u77e5\u5df1\u77e5\u5f7c\uff0c\u767e\u6230\u4e0d\u6b86\u3002 (''Zh\u012b j\u01d0 zh\u012b b\u01d0, b\u01cei zh\u00e0n b\u00f9 d\u00e0i.'')\n:If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win numerous (literally, \"a hundred\") battles without jeopardy.\n\n===English===\nCommon examples can also be found in English use, such as verse 18 in Chapter 1:\n:\u5175\u8005\uff0c\u8a6d\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u80fd\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u7528\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u4e0d\u7528\uff0c\u8fd1\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u9060\uff0c\u9060\u800c\u793a\u4e4b\u8fd1\u3002\n:All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.\n\nThis has been abbreviated to its most basic form and condensed into the English modern proverb:\n:All warfare is based on deception.\n\n==Cultural influence==\n===Military and intelligence applications===\nAcross [[East Asia]], ''The Art of War'' was part of the syllabus for potential candidates of military service examinations. \n\nDuring the [[Sengoku period]] (c. 1467\u20131568), the Japanese ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' named [[Takeda Shingen]] (1521\u20131573) is said to have become almost invincible in all battles without relying on [[gun]]s, because he studied ''The Art of War''.<ref name=\"Griffith 2007. p.150\">{{Smallcaps|Griffith, Samuel B.}} ''The Illustrated Art of War''. 2005. Oxford University Press. pp. 17, 141\u201343.</ref>  The book even gave him the inspiration for his famous battle standard \"[[F\u016brinkazan]]\" (Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain), meaning fast as the wind, silent as a forest, ferocious as fire and immovable as a mountain.\n\nThe translator [[Samuel B. Griffith]] offers a chapter on \"Sun Tzu and Mao Tse-Tung\" where ''The Art of War'' is cited as influencing Mao's ''[[On Guerrilla Warfare]]'', ''[[On Protracted War|On the Protracted War]]'' and ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'', and includes Mao's quote: \"We must not belittle the saying in the book of Sun Wu Tzu, the great military expert of ancient China, 'Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a thousand battles without disaster.\"<ref name=\"Griffith 2007. p.150\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], some [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Vietcong]] officers extensively studied ''The Art of War'' and reportedly could recite entire passages from memory. General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] successfully implemented tactics described in ''The Art of War'' during the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] ending major French involvement in Indochina and leading to the accords which partitioned Vietnam into North and South. General V\u00f5, later the main PVA military commander in the [[Vietnam War]], was an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas.<ref name=\"findarticles.com\">McCready, Douglas.

Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle: It gives tips on how to outsmart one's opponent so that physical battle is not necessary. As such, it has found application as a training guide for many competitive endeavors that do not involve actual combat.\n\n''The Art of War'' is mentioned as an influence in the earliest known Chinese collection of stories about fraud (mostly in the realm of commerce), Zhang Yingyu's [[The Book of Swindles]] (''Du pian xin shu'' \u675c\u9a19\u65b0\u66f8, ca. 1617), which dates to the late Ming dynasty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/search-results?keyword=book+of+swindles|title=Search Results &#124; book of swindles &#124; Columbia University Press}}</ref>\n\nMany business books have applied the lessons taken from the book to [[office politics]] and corporate business strategy.<ref>Michaelson, Gerald. \"Sun Tzu: The Art of War for Managers; 50 Strategic Rules.\" Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2001</ref><ref>McNeilly, Mark. \"Sun Tzu and the Art of Business : Six Strategic Principles for Managers.

In the 1987 movie ''[[Wall_Street_(1987_film)|Wall Street]]'', [[Gordon Gekko]] ([[Michael Douglas]]) frequently references The Art of War while dispensing advice to his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Bud Fox ([[Charlie Sheen]]).<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TLCaDbBv_s</ref> In the latter stages of the movie, Fox mentions Sun Tzu himself when describing his plan on trapping Gekko.<ref>https://www.quotes.net/mquote/102540</ref> \n\nIn television, ''The Art of War'' is most famously referenced in ''The Sopranos''.

In addition, it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video.\n* Rather than use a complex [[analog-to-digital]] circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.\n* A single 14.31818&nbsp;MHz master oscillator (f<sub>M</sub>) was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies, including the microprocessor clock signals (f<sub>M</sub>/14), the video transfer counters, and the color-burst samples (f<sub>M</sub>/4).\n\nThe text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement. For instance, the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory. This complexity was reportedly due to Wozniak's realization that the method would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect (as described above). This method had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and thus can be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for [[subpixel]] font rendering, since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title = The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher = Gibson Research Corporation |last = Gibson |first = Steve |accessdate = August 4, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |archivedate = July 21, 2006  |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II at first used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978, the company introduced an external {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web |title = 5-The Disk II |url = http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |publisher = Apple II History |first = Steven |last = Weyhrich |date = December 28, 2001 |accessdate = November 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |archivedate = December 1, 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Freiberger |first1 = Paul |authorlink1 = Paul Freiberger |first2 = Michael |last2 = Swaine |authorlink2 = Michael Swaine (technical author) |title = Fire In The Valley, Part Two |work = A+ Magazine |type = Book excerpt |date = January 1985 |page = 45 }}</ref>\n\nThe approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM ([[programmable read-only memory]]), he created a functional floppy disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.\n\n==Case design==\nSteve Jobs extensively pushed to give the Apple II a case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists, rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers. The result was a futuristic-looking molded white plastic case. Jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case.\n\nThe first production Apple IIs had hand-molded cases; these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process, which was soon switched to machine molding. In addition, the initial case design had no vent openings, causing high heat buildup from the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] and resulting in the plastic softening and sagging. Apple added vent holes to the case within three months of production; customers with the original case could have them replaced at no charge.\n\n==PCB revisions==\nThe Apple II's [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6,000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on-screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only 4 colors in hi-res mode, but Wozniak was able to increase this to 6 hi-res colors on later board revisions.\n\nThe PCB had three [[RAM]] banks for a total of 24 RAM chips. Original Apple IIs had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size, and RAM configurations could be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, or 48&nbsp;KiB. The three smallest memory configurations used 4kx1 [[DRAM]]s, with larger ones using 16kx1 DRAMs, or mix of 4-kilobyte and 16-kilobyte banks (the chips in any one bank have to be the same size). The early [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16kx1 chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full 48&nbsp;KiB complement of DRAM.\n\nUnlike most machines, all [[integrated circuit]]s on the Apple II PCB were socketed; although this cost more to manufacture and created the possibility of loose chips causing a system malfunction, it was considered preferable to make servicing and replacement of bad chips easier.\n\nThe Apple II PCB lacks any means of generating an [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]], although expansion cards may generate one. Program code had to stop everything to perform any [[Input/output|I/O]] task; like many of the computer's other idiosyncrasies, this was due to cost reasons and Steve Wozniak assuming interrupts were not needed for gaming or using the computer as a teaching tool.\n\n==Display and graphics==\n{{Main article|Apple II graphics}}\nColor on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the [[NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was added on later by adding a 3.58-megahertz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].\n\nThe Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.\n\nThe coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.\n\nA single HGR page occupied 8&nbsp;KiB of RAM; in practice this meant that the user had to have at least 12&nbsp;KiB of total RAM to use HGR mode and 20&nbsp;KiB to use two pages. Early Apple II games from the 1977 to 79 period often ran only in text or low resolution mode to support users with small memory configurations; HGR not being near universally supported by games until 1980.\n\n==Sound==\nRather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two-, three- and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.\n\n==Programming languages==\nInitially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. Since it only supported integers between -32768 and +32767 (signed 16-bit integer), it was less suitable to business software and Apple soon received complaints from customers. Because Steve Wozniak was too busy developing the Disk II hardware, he did not have time to modify Integer BASIC for floating point support, so Apple instead licensed Microsoft's 6502 BASIC to create [[Applesoft BASIC]]. Disk users normally purchased a so-called Language Card which had Applesoft in ROM and sat below the Integer BASIC ROM in system memory. The user could switch between either BASIC by typing FP or INT at the BASIC prompt. Apple also offered a different version of Applesoft for cassette users which occupied low memory and was started by using the LOAD command in Integer BASIC.\n\nAs shipped, the machine incorporated a \"monitor\" program which supported functions such as displaying and altering the contents of the computer's RAM memory in [[hexadecimal]] format, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This feature enabled hackers to write and debug machine code programs without needing further development software. The computer powered on into the monitor ROM and the user was greeted with a * prompt. From there, he could enter BASIC by typing Ctrl+B, or he could load a machine language program from cassette. Disk software could be booted by typing Ctrl+P followed by 6, referring to Slot 6 which normally contained the Disk II controller.\n\nA 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the [[UCSD]] compiler and operating system for the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16&nbsp;KiB RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48&nbsp;KiB of motherboard memory.\n\n==Manual==\nThe first 1,000 or so Apple IIs shipped in 1977 with a 68-page [[mimeograph]]ed \"Apple II Mini Manual\", hand-bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual,'' which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book. The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the \"Monitor\" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].\n\n==Third-party devices and applications==\nWhen the Apple II initially shipped in June 1977, no expansion cards were available for the slots. This meant that the user did not have any way of connecting a modem or a printer. One popular hack involved connecting a teletype machine to the cassette output.\n\nWozniak's [[open architecture|open-architecture]] design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There were plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]]\u2014such as the [[Z-80 SoftCard]]\u2014that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run programs for the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name=z80>{{cite magazine |magazine = [[InfoWorld]] |date = February 6, 1984 |volume = 6 |issue = 6 |quote = Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II. |page = 64 |title = Review: Premium Softcard IIe |last = Petersen |first = Marty }}</ref> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. The Z80 card also allowed the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, such networks were scarce. But they expanded significantly with the development of bulletin board systems in later years. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that allowed [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. Third-party [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]] greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] doubled or quadrupled the computer's speed.\n\nEarly Apple IIs were often sold with a [[Sup'R'Mod]], which allowed the composite video signal to be viewed on a television.\n\nThe Soviet Union electronics industry designed Apple II mostly compatible computer Agat 7, producing a similar computer known as the [[Agat (computer)|Agat]]. Roughly 12,000 were produced and it was widely used in Soviet Schools.<ref>http://www.computer-museum.ru/histsoft/informatika_sorucom_2011.htm</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Apple II advertisement Dec 1977 page 2.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Apple II (1977)]]\nJesse Adams Stein wrote, \"As the first company to release a 'consumer appliance' micro-computer, Apple Computer offers us a clear view of this shift from a ''machine'' to an ''appliance''.\" But the company also had \"to negotiate the attitudes of its potential buyers, bearing in mind social anxieties about the uptake of new technologies in multiple contexts.

In addition, it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video.\n* Rather than use a complex [[analog-to-digital]] circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.\n* A single 14.31818&nbsp;MHz master oscillator (f<sub>M</sub>) was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies, including the microprocessor clock signals (f<sub>M</sub>/14), the video transfer counters, and the color-burst samples (f<sub>M</sub>/4).\n\nThe text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement. For instance, the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory. This complexity was reportedly due to Wozniak's realization that the method would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect (as described above). This method had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and thus can be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for [[subpixel]] font rendering, since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title = The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher = Gibson Research Corporation |last = Gibson |first = Steve |accessdate = August 4, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |archivedate = July 21, 2006  |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II at first used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978, the company introduced an external {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web |title = 5-The Disk II |url = http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |publisher = Apple II History |first = Steven |last = Weyhrich |date = December 28, 2001 |accessdate = November 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |archivedate = December 1, 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Freiberger |first1 = Paul |authorlink1 = Paul Freiberger |first2 = Michael |last2 = Swaine |authorlink2 = Michael Swaine (technical author) |title = Fire In The Valley, Part Two |work = A+ Magazine |type = Book excerpt |date = January 1985 |page = 45 }}</ref>\n\nThe approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM ([[programmable read-only memory]]), he created a functional floppy disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.\n\n==Case design==\nSteve Jobs extensively pushed to give the Apple II a case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists, rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers. The result was a futuristic-looking molded white plastic case. Jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case.\n\nThe first production Apple IIs had hand-molded cases; these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process, which was soon switched to machine molding. In addition, the initial case design had no vent openings, causing high heat buildup from the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] and resulting in the plastic softening and sagging. Apple added vent holes to the case within three months of production; customers with the original case could have them replaced at no charge.\ngf rhcntgeiuyrceytrubyioeu6oi; erutorimoeirx,pofoitpoanubyotisuqgpw4tx,32g5pobuyivneeeeeeecrp4pnob6tuop42riu5o4h5ut3485h'poiuhocybrvcurye;oiguop3ruwenoi;thoiuyi;ouhsumvcopfmgio;stu jbntihskjg o;uhgulf hhenjrghlr\nend of story\n\n==PCB revisions==\nThe Apple II's [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6,000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on-screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only 4 colors in hi-res mode, but Wozniak was able to increase this to 6 hi-res colors on later board revisions.\n\nThe PCB had three [[RAM]] banks for a total of 24 RAM chips. Original Apple IIs had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size, and RAM configurations could be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, or 48&nbsp;KiB. The three smallest memory configurations used 4kx1 [[DRAM]]s, with larger ones using 16kx1 DRAMs, or mix of 4-kilobyte and 16-kilobyte banks (the chips in any one bank have to be the same size). The early [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16kx1 chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full 48&nbsp;KiB complement of DRAM.\n\nUnlike most machines, all [[integrated circuit]]s on the Apple II PCB were socketed; although this cost more to manufacture and created the possibility of loose chips causing a system malfunction, it was considered preferable to make servicing and replacement of bad chips easier.\n\nThe Apple II PCB lacks any means of generating an [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]], although expansion cards may generate one. Program code had to stop everything to perform any [[Input/output|I/O]] task; like many of the computer's other idiosyncrasies, this was due to cost reasons and Steve Wozniak assuming interrupts were not needed for gaming or using the computer as a teaching tool.\n\n==Display and graphics==\n{{Main article|Apple II graphics}}\nColor on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the [[NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was added on later by adding a 3.58-megahertz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].\n\nThe Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.\n\nThe coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.\n\nA single HGR page occupied 8&nbsp;KiB of RAM; in practice this meant that the user had to have at least 12&nbsp;KiB of total RAM to use HGR mode and 20&nbsp;KiB to use two pages. Early Apple II games from the 1977 to 79 period often ran only in text or low resolution mode to support users with small memory configurations; HGR not being near universally supported by games until 1980.\n\n==Sound==\nRather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two-, three- and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.\n\n==Programming languages==\nInitially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. Since it only supported integers between -32768 and +32767 (signed 16-bit integer), it was less suitable to business software and Apple soon received complaints from customers. Because Steve Wozniak was too busy developing the Disk II hardware, he did not have time to modify Integer BASIC for floating point support, so Apple instead licensed Microsoft's 6502 BASIC to create [[Applesoft BASIC]]. Disk users normally purchased a so-called Language Card which had Applesoft in ROM and sat below the Integer BASIC ROM in system memory. The user could switch between either BASIC by typing FP or INT at the BASIC prompt. Apple also offered a different version of Applesoft for cassette users which occupied low memory and was started by using the LOAD command in Integer BASIC.\n\nAs shipped, the machine incorporated a \"monitor\" program which supported functions such as displaying and altering the contents of the computer's RAM memory in [[hexadecimal]] format, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This feature enabled hackers to write and debug machine code programs without needing further development software. The computer powered on into the monitor ROM and the user was greeted with a * prompt. From there, he could enter BASIC by typing Ctrl+B, or he could load a machine language program from cassette. Disk software could be booted by typing Ctrl+P followed by 6, referring to Slot 6 which normally contained the Disk II controller.\n\nA 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the [[UCSD]] compiler and operating system for the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16&nbsp;KiB RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48&nbsp;KiB of motherboard memory.\n\n==Manual==\nThe first 1,000 or so Apple IIs shipped in 1977 with a 68-page [[mimeograph]]ed \"Apple II Mini Manual\", hand-bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual,'' which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book. The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the \"Monitor\" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].\n\n==Third-party devices and applications==\nWhen the Apple II initially shipped in June 1977, no expansion cards were available for the slots. This meant that the user did not have any way of connecting a modem or a printer. One popular hack involved connecting a teletype machine to the cassette output.\n\nWozniak's [[open architecture|open-architecture]] design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There were plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]]\u2014such as the [[Z-80 SoftCard]]\u2014that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run programs for the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name=z80>{{cite magazine |magazine = [[InfoWorld]] |date = February 6, 1984 |volume = 6 |issue = 6 |quote = Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II. |page = 64 |title = Review: Premium Softcard IIe |last = Petersen |first = Marty }}</ref> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. The Z80 card also allowed the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, such networks were scarce. But they expanded significantly with the development of bulletin board systems in later years. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that allowed [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. Third-party [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]] greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] doubled or quadrupled the computer's speed.\n\nEarly Apple IIs were often sold with a [[Sup'R'Mod]], which allowed the composite video signal to be viewed on a television.\n\nThe Soviet Union electronics industry designed Apple II mostly compatible computer Agat 7, producing a similar computer known as the [[Agat (computer)|Agat]]. Roughly 12,000 were produced and it was widely used in Soviet Schools.<ref>http://www.computer-museum.ru/histsoft/informatika_sorucom_2011.htm</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Apple II advertisement Dec 1977 page 2.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Apple II (1977)]]\nJesse Adams Stein wrote, \"As the first company to release a 'consumer appliance' micro-computer, Apple Computer offers us a clear view of this shift from a ''machine'' to an ''appliance''.\" But the company also had \"to negotiate the attitudes of its potential buyers, bearing in mind social anxieties about the uptake of new technologies in multiple contexts.

The first apparition occurred on the morning of December 9, 1531 (on the Julian calendar, which would be December 19 on the Gregorian calendar used today), when it is said that a native Mexican peasant named Juan Diego experienced a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of a young woman at a place called the Hill of [[Tepeyac]], which would become part of [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Villa de Guadalupe]], in a suburb of [[Mexico City]].\n\nAccording to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in his native [[Nahuatl]] language (the language of the [[Aztec Empire]]), identified herself as the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], \"mother of the very true deity\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sousa |first=Lisa |authorlink=Lisa Sousa |translator=[[Stafford Poole]]; [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] |year=1998 |title=The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's ''Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica'' of 1649 |series=UCLA Latin American studies, vol. 84; Nahuatl studies series, no. 5 |location=Stanford and Los Angeles, California |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Latin American Center Publications |isbn=0-8047-3482-8 |oclc=39455844 |page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofguadalupe84lass/page/65 65] |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofguadalupe84lass |url-access=registration }}</ref> She was said to have asked for a church to be built at that site in her honor.\n \nBased on her words, Juan Diego then sought out the archbishop of Mexico City, Fray [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the bishop did not believe Diego, but on the same day Juan Diego saw the young woman for a second time (the second apparition). The story continues saying she then asked him to keep insisting.\n\nOn Sunday, December 10, Juan Diego talked to the archbishop for a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac Hill, and to ask the lady for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. That same day, the third apparition occurred when Diego returned to Tepeyac and encountering the same woman, he reported back to her the bishop's request for a sign; she consented to provide one on the following day (December 11).<ref>This apparition is somewhat elided in the ''Nican Mopohua'' but is implicit in three brief passages (Sousa et al., pp. 75, 77, 83).  It is fully described in the ''Imagen de la Virgen Mar\u00eda'' of Miguel S\u00e1nchez published in 1648.</ref>\n\nBy Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego's uncle, [[Juan Bernardino]], had fallen sick so Juan Diego was obliged to attend to him. In the very early hours of Tuesday, December 12, Juan Bernardino's condition having deteriorated overnight, Juan Diego set out to [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City|Tlatelolco]] to fetch a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and help minister to him on his death-bed.\n\n[[File:Dibujo Escudo de Armas de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|right|Preliminary drawing of the Mexican Coat of arms, c. 1743]]\n\nIn order to avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, \"\u00bfNo estoy yo aqu\u00ed que soy tu madre?\" (\"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\"). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan followed her instructions and he found [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.\n\n[[File:Convento_de_San_Francisco_-_Ciudad_de_M\u00e9xico_-_Creyente.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of the [[Church and Convent of San Francisco, Madero Street, Mexico City|Convent of San Francisco]], Historic Center of Mexico City.]]\n\nThe Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's ''[[Tilm\u00e0tli|tilma]]'', or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zum\u00e1rraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.<ref>English translation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042328/http://www.interlupe.com.mx/nican-e.html ''Nican Mopohua''], a 17th-century account written in the native Nahuatl language.</ref>\n\nThe next day, on December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too had seen her, at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and he said that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.\n\nThe bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected [[chapel]].<ref>The date does not appear in the ''Nican Mopohua'', but in Sanchez's ''Imagen''.</ref> In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.<ref>The procession and miracle are not part of the ''Nican Mopohua'' proper, but introduce the ''Nican Mopectana'' which immediately follows the ''Nican Mopohua'' in the ''Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica''.</ref>\n\nJuan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular support. In the 19th century it became the rallying call of the Spaniards born in America, in what they labeled New Spain. They said they saw the story of the apparition as legitimizing their own indigenous Mexican origin, infused it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity \u2013 thus also legitimizing their armed rebellion against Spain.<ref name = \"Poole\">Poole, Stafford.

Berkeley: University of California Press 1966, p. 188.</ref> In particular, the canonical account of the vision also features archbishop [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]] as a major player in the story, but, although Zum\u00e1rraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the indigenous story.\n\nThe written record that does exist suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the native beliefs springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the [[Franciscan order]] (who then had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the outside groups, while the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] supported it.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 189.</ref>\n\nThe main promoter of the story and those  native believers was the Dominican [[Alonso de Mont\u00fafar]], who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Mont\u00fafar commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\" referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:\n\n<blockquote>The devotion at the chapel ... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not.{{sfn|Poole, p. 60}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Estandarte de Cortes en anno 1521.jpeg|thumbnail|The banner of the Mexican conquistador [[Hernan Cortes]] from year 1521, which was kept within the Archbishop's villa during the time of the Guadalupe apparitions.]]\n\nThe next day Archbishop Mont\u00fafar opened an inquiry into the matter. At the inquiry, the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's claim that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\".{{sfn|Poole, pp. 60\u201362}} This could refer to the Aztec painter [[Marcos Cipac de Aquino]], who was active at that time.<ref>{{Skeptoid|id=4201|number=201|date=13 April 2010|title=The Virgin of Guadalupe|accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref><ref>J.

There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin.   While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but ''Dios inantzin''. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin.<ref>Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''Florentine Codex: Introduction and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1982, p. 90.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSahag\u00fan's criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] application of the native name ''Tonantzin'' to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahag\u00fan often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.<ref>L. Burkhart (2001). ''Before Guadalupe: the Virgin Mary in early colonial Nahuatl literature.''

This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated.

Finally, under Pope John Paul II the move to [[beatification|beatify]] Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on 6 May 1990, during a Mass at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico City, declaring him \"protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples,\" with December 9 established as his feast day.\n\nAt that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga|Zum\u00e1rraga]], into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the [[Basilica of Guadalupe]], [[Guillermo Schulenburg]], was forced to resign following an interview published in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] magazine ''Ixthus,'' in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the \"recognition of a cult.

This appears to be borne out by the fact that this goddess already had a temple dedicated to her on the very Tepeyac Hill where Juan Diego had his vision, the same temple which had recently been destroyed at the behest of the new Spanish Catholic authorities. In the 16th century the Franciscans were suspicious that the followers of Guadalupe showed, or was susceptible to, elements of [[syncretism]], i.e. the importation of an object of reverence in one belief system into another (see above).\n\nThe theory promoting the [[Spanish language]] origin of the name claims that:\n\n*[[Juan Diego]] and Juan Bernardino would have been familiar with the [[Spanish language]] \"g\" and \"d\" sounds since their baptismal names contain those sounds.\n*There is no documentation of any other name for this Marian apparition during the almost 144 years between the apparition being recorded in 1531 and Becerra Tanco's proposed theory in 1675.\n*Documents written by contemporary Spaniards and Franciscan friars argue that for the name to be changed to a native name, such as ''Tepeaca'' or ''Tepeaquilla,'' would not make sense to them, if a [[Nahuatl]] name were already in use, and suggest the Spanish ''Guadalupe'' was the original.<ref name=\"Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205\"/>\n\n== The venerated image as artifact==\n\n=== Iconographic description ===\n[[File:Miguel_Cabrera_-_Altarpiece_of_the_Virgin_of_Guadalupe_with_Saint_John_the_Baptist,_Fray_Juan_de_Zum\u00e1rraga_and_Juan_Diego_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The altar image of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] with [[St. John the Baptist]], [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]] and [[St. Juan Diego]] by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]]]\n* The image features a full-length representation of a [[mestiza]] girl or young woman with high cheek-bones, delicate features, and straight, unbraided black hair simply parted in the middle framing her face.\n* The subject matter is in a standing posture showing in contemplative prayer with hands joined and [[little finger]] separated and head slightly inclined; she gazes with heavy-lidded eyes at a spot below and to her right, and to left in viewpoint of the observer. \n*  She is dressed from neck to feet in a pink robe and blue-green [[cerulean]] mantle, one side folded within the arms, emblazoned with eight-pointed stars with two black tassels tied at high waist, wearing a neck brooch featuring a colonial styled cross. \n* The robe is spangled with a small gold [[quatrefoil]] motif ornamented with vines and flowers, its sleeves reaching to her wrists where the cuffs of a white undergarment appear. \n* The subject stands on a crescent moon, allegedly colored silver in the past, now having turned dark. \n* A feathered [[cherub]]ic angel with outstretched arms carries the robe on her exposed feet which is uncolored. \n* A sunburst of straight and wavy gold rays alternate while projecting behind the Virgin and are enclosed within a [[mandorla]].

The join is clearly visible as a seam passing from top to bottom, with the Virgin's face and hands and the head of the angel on the left piece. It passes through the left wrist of the Virgin.  The fabric is mounted on a large metal sheet to which it has been glued for some time.<ref>Callahan, Philip Serna, ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation'', CARA Studies on Popular Devotion, vol. II: Guadalupanan Studies No. 3, p. 16.</ref>  The image, currently set in a massive frame protected behind bullet-proof glass, hangs inclined at a slight angle on the wall of the basilica behind the altar.  At this point, there is a wide gap between the wall and the sanctuary facilitating closer viewing from moving walkways set on the floor beneath the main level of the basilica, carrying people a short distance in either direction.  Viewed from the main body of the basilica, the image is located above and to the right of the altar and is retracted at night into a small vault (accessible by steps) set into the wall.<ref>For a brief description of the vault, see Callahan, Philip Serna, ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation'', CARA Studies on Popular Devotion, vol.

It was traditionally held to be made from ''[[ixtle]],'' an [[agave]] fiber.\n* Ground, or primer: R asserted (MC and PC contra) by ocular examination that the tilma was primed, though with primer \"applied irregularly.\" R does not clarify whether his observed \"irregular\" application entails that majorly the entire tilma was primed, or just certain areas&nbsp;\u2013 such as those areas of the tilma extrinsic to the image&nbsp;\u2013 where PC agrees had later additions.  MC, alternatively, observed that the image had soaked through to the reverse of the tilma.<ref>Brading (2001), ''Mexican Phoenix'', p. 170</ref>\n\n*  Under-drawing: PC asserted there was no under-drawing.\n*  Brush-work: R suggested (PC contra) there was some visible brushwork on the original image, but in a minute area of the image (\"her eyes, including the irises, have outlines, apparently applied by a brush\").\n* Condition of the surface layer: PC reports that the un-retouched portions of the image, particularly the blue mantle and the face, are in a very good state of preservation, with no flaking or peeling. The three most recent inspections (G, PC and R) agree (i) that additions have been made to the image (gold leaf added to the Sun's rays\u2014which has flaked off; silver paint or other material to depict the Moon\u2014which has discolored; and the re-construction or addition of the angel supporting the Marian image),  and (ii) that portions of the original image have been abraded and re-touched in places.  Some flaking is visible, though only in retouched areas (mostly along the line of the vertical seam, or at passages considered to be later additions).\n*  Varnish: The tilma has never been varnished.\n*  Binding Medium: R provisionally identified the [[pigments]] and binding medium (distemper) as consistent with 16th-century methods of painting sargas (MC, PC contra for different reasons), but the color values and luminosity are in good condition.\n:The technique of painting on fabric with water-soluble pigments (with or without primer or ground) is well-attested. The binding medium is generally animal glue or [[gum arabic]] (see: [[Distemper (paint)|Distemper]]).

Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas.  \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp.&nbsp;124\u2013129) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" De Leon, who at first didn't allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women.  But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantz\u00edn, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence.  In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are.  No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantz\u00edn.   Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).<ref>Cisneros, Sandra.  \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises.\"  ''Woman Hollering Creed and Other Stories''.

The first apparition occurred on the morning of December 9, 1531 (on the Julian calendar, which would be December 19 on the Gregorian calendar used today), when it is said that a native Mexican peasant named Juan Diego experienced a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of a young woman at a place called the Hill of [[Tepeyac]], which would become part of [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Villa de Guadalupe]], in a suburb of [[Mexico City]].\n\nAccording to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in his native [[Nahuatl]] language (the language of the [[Aztec Empire]]), identified herself as the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], \"mother of the very true deity\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sousa |first=Lisa |authorlink=Lisa Sousa |translator=[[Stafford Poole]]; [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] |year=1998 |title=The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's ''Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica'' of 1649 |series=UCLA Latin American studies, vol. 84; Nahuatl studies series, no. 5 |location=Stanford and Los Angeles, California |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Latin American Center Publications |isbn=0-8047-3482-8 |oclc=39455844 |page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofguadalupe84lass/page/65 65] |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofguadalupe84lass |url-access=registration }}</ref> She was said to have asked for a church to be built at that site in her honor.\n \nBased on her words, Juan Diego then sought out the archbishop of Mexico City, Fray [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the bishop did not believe Diego, but on the same day Juan Diego saw the young woman for a second time (the second apparition). The story continues saying she then asked him to keep insisting.\n\nOn Sunday, December 10, Juan Diego talked to the archbishop for a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac Hill, and to ask the lady for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. That same day, the third apparition occurred when Diego returned to Tepeyac and encountering the same woman, he reported back to her the bishop's request for a sign; she consented to provide one on the following day (December 11).<ref>This apparition is somewhat elided in the ''Nican Mopohua'' but is implicit in three brief passages (Sousa et al., pp. 75, 77, 83).  It is fully described in the ''Imagen de la Virgen Mar\u00eda'' of Miguel S\u00e1nchez published in 1648.</ref>\n\nBy Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego's uncle, [[Juan Bernardino]], had fallen sick so Juan Diego was obliged to attend to him. In the very early hours of Tuesday, December 12, Juan Bernardino's condition having deteriorated overnight, Juan Diego set out to [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City|Tlatelolco]] to fetch a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and help minister to him on his death-bed.\n\n[[File:Dibujo Escudo de Armas de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|right|Preliminary drawing of the Mexican Coat of arms, c. 1743]]\n\nIn order to avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, \"\u00bfNo estoy yo aqu\u00ed que soy tu madre?\" (\"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\"). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan followed her instructions and he found [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.\n\n[[File:Convento_de_San_Francisco_-_Ciudad_de_M\u00e9xico_-_Creyente.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of the [[Church and Convent of San Francisco, Madero Street, Mexico City|Convent of San Francisco]], Historic Center of Mexico City.]]\n\nThe Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's ''[[Tilm\u00e0tli|tilma]]'', or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zum\u00e1rraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.<ref>English translation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042328/http://www.interlupe.com.mx/nican-e.html ''Nican Mopohua''], a 17th-century account written in the native Nahuatl language.</ref>\n\nThe next day, on December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too had seen her, at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and he said that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.\n\nThe bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected [[chapel]].<ref>The date does not appear in the ''Nican Mopohua'', but in Sanchez's ''Imagen''.</ref> In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.<ref>The procession and miracle are not part of the ''Nican Mopohua'' proper, but introduce the ''Nican Mopectana'' which immediately follows the ''Nican Mopohua'' in the ''Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica''.</ref>\n\nJuan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular support. In the 19th century it became the rallying call of the Spaniards born in America, in what they labeled New Spain.

In a 1556 sermon Mont\u00fafar commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\" referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:\n\n<blockquote>The devotion at the chapel ... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not.{{sfn|Poole, p. 60}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Estandarte de Cortes en anno 1521.jpeg|thumbnail|The banner of the Mexican conquistador [[Hernan Cortes]] from year 1521, which was kept within the Archbishop's villa during the time of the Guadalupe apparitions.]]\n\nThe next day Archbishop Mont\u00fafar opened an inquiry into the matter. At the inquiry, the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's claim that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\".{{sfn|Poole, pp. 60\u201362}} This could refer to the Aztec painter [[Marcos Cipac de Aquino]], who was active at that time.<ref>{{Skeptoid|id=4201|number=201|date=13 April 2010|title=The Virgin of Guadalupe|accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref><ref>J.

There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin.   While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but ''Dios inantzin''. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin.<ref>Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''Florentine Codex: Introduction and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1982, p. 90.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSahag\u00fan's criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] application of the native name ''Tonantzin'' to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahag\u00fan often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.<ref>L. Burkhart (2001). ''Before Guadalupe: the Virgin Mary in early colonial Nahuatl literature.''

Finally, under Pope John Paul II the move to [[beatification|beatify]] Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on 6 May 1990, during a Mass at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico City, declaring him \"protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples,\" with December 9 established as his feast day.\n\nAt that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga|Zum\u00e1rraga]], into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the [[Basilica of Guadalupe]], [[Guillermo Schulenburg]], was forced to resign following an interview published in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] magazine ''Ixthus,'' in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the \"recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.\"<ref>[http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/archives/1999Dec/232dec7,vol.10,no.232txt/dec7nv4.htm ''Daily Catholic''], December 7, 1999, accessed November 30, 2006</ref> In 1883 [[Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta]], historian and biographer of Zum\u00e1rraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for [[Bishop]] Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision.

Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997.<ref name = \"Deerskin\"/> Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the [[road to Damascus]], drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\"<ref name=\"brading\" />\n\n===  Marian title ===\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Virgin of Guadalupe - Isidro Escamilla - overall.jpg|thumbnail| ''Virgin of Guadalupe'', 1 September 1824.

Others hold that the Spanish name ''Guadalupe'' is the original name, and refers to the Spanish [[Our Lady of Guadalupe, Extremadura]], whose cult had been important in Spain in the 16th century and had been brought to the New World with the Spanish conquest.\n\nThe first theory to promote a [[Nahuatl]] origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco.<ref name=\"Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205\"/> In his 1675 work ''Felicidad de Mexico'', Becerra Tanco claimed that Juan Bernardino and [[Juan Diego]] would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \"d\" and \"g\" sounds do not exist in [[Nahuatl]].\n\nHe proposed two [[Nahuatl]] alternative names that sound similar to \"Guadalupe\", ''Tecuatlanopeuh'' {{IPA-nah|tek\u02b7at\u0361\u026ca\u02c8nope\u028d|}}, which he translates as \"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\", and ''Tecuantlaxopeuh'' {{IPA-nah|tek\u02b7ant\u0361\u026ca\u02c8\u0283ope\u028d|}}, \"she who banishes those who devoured us.\"<ref name=\"Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205\"/>\n\nOndina and Justo Gonzalez suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the [[Nahuatl]] term, ''[[Coatlaxopeuh|Co\u0101tlaxopeuh]]'' {{IPA-nah|koa\u02d0t\u0361\u026ca\u02c8\u0283ope\u028d|}}, which they interpret as meaning \"the one who crushes the serpent,\" and that it may seem to be referring to the feathered serpent [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In addition, the Virgin Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] of the Garden of Eden.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez, Ondina E. and Justo L. Gonz\u00e1lez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8TO3FpclI-gC&dq ''Christianity in Latin America: A History''], p. 59, Cambridge University Press, 2008</ref>\n\nAccording to another theory the juxtaposition of Guadalupe and a snake may indicate a nexus with the Aztec goddess of love and fertility, [[Tonantzin]] (in Nahuatl, \"Our Revered Mother\"), who was also known by the name [[Coatlicue|Coatl\u00edcue]] (\"The Serpent Skirt\"). This appears to be borne out by the fact that this goddess already had a temple dedicated to her on the very Tepeyac Hill where Juan Diego had his vision, the same temple which had recently been destroyed at the behest of the new Spanish Catholic authorities. In the 16th century the Franciscans were suspicious that the followers of Guadalupe showed, or was susceptible to, elements of [[syncretism]], i.e. the importation of an object of reverence in one belief system into another (see above).\n\nThe theory promoting the [[Spanish language]] origin of the name claims that:\n\n*[[Juan Diego]] and Juan Bernardino would have been familiar with the [[Spanish language]] \"g\" and \"d\" sounds since their baptismal names contain those sounds.\n*There is no documentation of any other name for this Marian apparition during the almost 144 years between the apparition being recorded in 1531 and Becerra Tanco's proposed theory in 1675.\n*Documents written by contemporary Spaniards and Franciscan friars argue that for the name to be changed to a native name, such as ''Tepeaca'' or ''Tepeaquilla,'' would not make sense to them, if a [[Nahuatl]] name were already in use, and suggest the Spanish ''Guadalupe'' was the original.<ref name=\"Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205\"/>\n\n== The venerated image as artifact==\n\n=== Iconographic description ===\n[[File:Miguel_Cabrera_-_Altarpiece_of_the_Virgin_of_Guadalupe_with_Saint_John_the_Baptist,_Fray_Juan_de_Zum\u00e1rraga_and_Juan_Diego_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The altar image of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] with [[St. John the Baptist]], [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]] and [[St. Juan Diego]] by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]]]\n* The image features a full-length representation of a [[mestiza]] girl or young woman with high cheek-bones, delicate features, and straight, unbraided black hair simply parted in the middle framing her face.\n* The subject matter is in a standing posture showing in contemplative prayer with hands joined and [[little finger]] separated and head slightly inclined; she gazes with heavy-lidded eyes at a spot below and to her right, and to left in viewpoint of the observer. \n*  She is dressed from neck to feet in a pink robe and blue-green [[cerulean]] mantle, one side folded within the arms, emblazoned with eight-pointed stars with two black tassels tied at high waist, wearing a neck brooch featuring a colonial styled cross. \n* The robe is spangled with a small gold [[quatrefoil]] motif ornamented with vines and flowers, its sleeves reaching to her wrists where the cuffs of a white undergarment appear. \n* The subject stands on a crescent moon, allegedly colored silver in the past, now having turned dark. \n* A feathered [[cherub]]ic angel with outstretched arms carries the robe on her exposed feet which is uncolored. \n* A sunburst of straight and wavy gold rays alternate while projecting behind the Virgin and are enclosed within a [[mandorla]].

At this point, there is a wide gap between the wall and the sanctuary facilitating closer viewing from moving walkways set on the floor beneath the main level of the basilica, carrying people a short distance in either direction.  Viewed from the main body of the basilica, the image is located above and to the right of the altar and is retracted at night into a small vault (accessible by steps) set into the wall.<ref>For a brief description of the vault, see Callahan, Philip Serna, ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation'', CARA Studies on Popular Devotion, vol.

It was traditionally held to be made from ''[[ixtle]],'' an [[agave]] fiber.\n* Ground, or primer: R asserted (MC and PC contra) by ocular examination that the tilma was primed, though with primer \"applied irregularly.\" R does not clarify whether his observed \"irregular\" application entails that majorly the entire tilma was primed, or just certain areas&nbsp;\u2013 such as those areas of the tilma extrinsic to the image&nbsp;\u2013 where PC agrees had later additions.  MC, alternatively, observed that the image had soaked through to the reverse of the tilma.<ref>Brading (2001), ''Mexican Phoenix'', p. 170</ref>\n\n*  Under-drawing: PC asserted there was no under-drawing.\n*  Brush-work: R suggested (PC contra) there was some visible brushwork on the original image, but in a minute area of the image (\"her eyes, including the irises, have outlines, apparently applied by a brush\").\n* Condition of the surface layer: PC reports that the un-retouched portions of the image, particularly the blue mantle and the face, are in a very good state of preservation, with no flaking or peeling. The three most recent inspections (G, PC and R) agree (i) that additions have been made to the image (gold leaf added to the Sun's rays\u2014which has flaked off; silver paint or other material to depict the Moon\u2014which has discolored; and the re-construction or addition of the angel supporting the Marian image),  and (ii) that portions of the original image have been abraded and re-touched in places.  Some flaking is visible, though only in retouched areas (mostly along the line of the vertical seam, or at passages considered to be later additions).\n*  Varnish: The tilma has never been varnished.\n*  Binding Medium: R provisionally identified the [[pigments]] and binding medium (distemper) as consistent with 16th-century methods of painting sargas (MC, PC contra for different reasons), but the color values and luminosity are in good condition.\n:The technique of painting on fabric with water-soluble pigments (with or without primer or ground) is well-attested. The binding medium is generally animal glue or [[gum arabic]] (see: [[Distemper (paint)|Distemper]]).

Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas.  \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp.&nbsp;124\u2013129) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" De Leon, who at first didn't allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women.  But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantz\u00edn, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence.  In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are.  No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantz\u00edn.   Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).<ref>Cisneros, Sandra.  \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises.\"  ''Woman Hollering Creed and Other Stories''.

The two are some of the most historically successful intercollegiate programs, combining for 20 national titles, nine of which have come in the [[NCAA]] era.

After five games in six years, the series would go on an 18-year hiatus before resuming as an annual fixture in 1950. Virginia grabbed its victory in nine tries with a five goal win in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/documents/2019/5/29/alltimeresults.pdf?id=6406|title=All Time Results 2020 (PDF)|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\nThe following year, the teams would meet in 1954 as conference foes for the first time. Maryland continued its early series dominance in response to its first series loss by reeling off another eight consecutive victories. Virginia would snap that streak with its first home victory in 1962, before closing the decade with its first victory in College Park since 1953 in a 9\u20137 win.<ref name=\":1\" /> A victory the following year would be the final before the advent of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]]. At the end of this era, Maryland would hold a commanding 21 to 5 series lead, punctuated by its eight game winning streaks.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe advent of the NCAA tournament and rise of Virginia as a major lacrosse power led to a hotly contested period in the series's history. However, the Terps would win the final five meetings of the 1970s, including their first meeting in the postseason, a 15 to 10 victory in the [[1978 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1978 quarterfinals]].\n\n=== Virginian Dominance (1980s to Present) ===\nVirginia would grab the initiative in 1980, winning seven of the next eight, though Maryland would again top the Cavaliers in the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1983 quarterfinals]]. Since 1980, the Cavs have won 37 of 55 meetings to narrow Maryland's series lead to just two games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/news/2019/5/16/mens-lacrosse-no-4-uva-and-no-6-maryland-rekindle-rivalry-on-saturday-in-the-ncaa-quarterfinals.aspx|title=No. 4 UVA and No. 6 Maryland Rekindle Rivalry on Saturday in the NCAA Quarterfinals|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Nonetheless, the meetings have often been between top five ranked teams and have lead to numerous classic games.

rivalry between the [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland Terrapins]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Virginia Cavaliers]]. The teams first met in 1926 and have met 92 times. The two are some of the most historically successful intercollegiate programs, combining for 20 national titles, nine of which have come in the [[NCAA]] era. The Terps and Cavaliers were league foes in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] from 1954 to 2014, before Maryland joined the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Svrluga|first=Barry|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/maryland-joins-big-ten-leaving-acc/2012/11/19/e24531dc-3268-11e2-9cfa-e41bac906cc9_story.html|title=Big Ten Expansion: Maryland leaves ACC, joins conference in financial move|date=2012-11-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2020-04-08|last2=Prewitt|first2=and Alex|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/ncaa/marylands-move-big-ten-was-no-brainer|title=Maryland's move to the Big Ten was a no brainer|date=2012-11-19|website=NBC Sports Washington|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The teams ceased their annual matchup until a meeting five years later in the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]].

After five games in six years, the series would go on an 18-year hiatus before resuming as an annual fixture in 1950. Virginia grabbed its victory in nine tries with a five goal win in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/documents/2019/5/29/alltimeresults.pdf?id=6406|title=All Time Results 2020 (PDF)|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\nThe following year, the teams would meet in 1954 as conference foes for the first time. Maryland continued its early series dominance in response to its first series loss by reeling off another eight consecutive victories. Virginia would snap that streak with its first home victory in 1962, before closing the decade with its first victory in College Park since 1953 in a 9\u20137 win.<ref name=\":1\" /> A victory the following year would be the final before the advent of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]]. At the end of this era, Maryland would hold a commanding 21 to 5 series lead, punctuated by its eight game winning streaks.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe advent of the NCAA tournament and rise of Virginia as a major lacrosse power led to a hotly contested period in the series's history. However, the Terps would win the final five meetings of the 1970s, including their first meeting in the postseason, a 15 to 10 victory in the [[1978 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1978 quarterfinals]].\n\n=== Virginian Dominance (1980s to Present) ===\nVirginia would grab the initiative in 1980, winning seven of the next eight, though Maryland would again top the Cavaliers in the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1983 quarterfinals]]. Since 1980, the Cavs have won 37 of 55 meetings to narrow Maryland's series lead to just two games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/news/2019/5/16/mens-lacrosse-no-4-uva-and-no-6-maryland-rekindle-rivalry-on-saturday-in-the-ncaa-quarterfinals.aspx|title=No. 4 UVA and No. 6 Maryland Rekindle Rivalry on Saturday in the NCAA Quarterfinals|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Nonetheless, the meetings have often been between top five ranked teams and have lead to numerous classic games.

The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical [[Mesolithic]] period, just after the [[Ice Age]].<ref name=TWO/> \nLaum\u0117s could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laum\u0117s had an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] appearance: they usually had birds\u2019 claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat.  Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to [[centaurs]].  Like [[cyclops]], Laum\u0117s often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of [[belemnitida]] found on the ground were called \"Laum\u0117s nipples.\"<ref name=ONE>Laum\u0117. Mitologijos enciklopedija, 2 tomas. \u2013 Vilnius: Vaga, 1999. \u2013 283 p.</ref>\n\nLaum\u0117s were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or [[Pinch (action)|tweak]] them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way, they were similar to Lamia of [[Greek mythology]]. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laum\u0117s kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their [[udder]]s.  Laum\u0117s were afraid of tools made from [[iron]].<ref name=ONE/>\n\nLaum\u0117s can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laum\u0117 was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laum\u0117 was a bride of thunder god [[Perk\u016bnas]]; however, they did not marry because Laum\u0117 fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania.  In other stories, the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laum\u0117 liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perk\u016bnas was a Laum\u0117 called [[Vaiva]]. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage, she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perk\u016bnas is angry and shouts in thunder.<ref name=ONE/> It was believed it is the rainbow that causes the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laum\u0117 fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meil\u0117' - love). Laum\u0117 descended to the sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into the highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laum\u0117s breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth.\n\nLaum\u0117s descended from the sky to Earth. They lived nearby lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Lots of names of water pools in Lithuania are named after the word Laum\u0117. Laum\u0117s liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in the night in New Moon or [[Full Moon]]. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like [[Fairy Ring]]) in the grass. Usually, Laum\u0117s were most powerful at Friday of [[New Moon]], at the rainiest days of the month in Lithuania. Laum\u0117s could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laum\u0117s song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in a circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.<ref>An encyclopedic dictionary of mythological and folkloric characters, epics, legends, etc. of most nations of the world, with particular attention to nations of the USSR.

The [[Rainbow]] was often called a ribbon lost by Laum\u0117s. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laum\u0117s usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women\u2019s work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two examples [[Folklore|folk tale]]s featuring Laum\u0117s:<ref name=TWO>Of Gods and Men: Studies in Lithuanian Mythology (Folklore Studies in Translation), Algirdas J.

She served her husband, who asked her \"Where\u2019s my son?\" With terror, she whispered, \"I have forgotten him!\" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laum\u00e9 speak: \"[[\u010ci\u016b\u010dia li\u016blia]], forgotten child.\" The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back.

The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical [[Mesolithic]] period, just after the [[Ice Age]].<ref name=TWO/> \nLaum\u0117s could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laum\u0117s had an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] appearance: they usually had birds\u2019 claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat.  Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to [[centaurs]].  Like [[cyclops]], Laum\u0117s often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of [[belemnitida]] found on the ground were called \"Laum\u0117s nipples.\"<ref name=ONE>Laum\u0117. Mitologijos enciklopedija, 2 tomas. \u2013 Vilnius: Vaga, 1999. \u2013 283 p.</ref>\n\nLaum\u0117s were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or [[Pinch (action)|tweak]] them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way, they were similar to Lamia of [[Greek mythology]]. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laum\u0117s kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their [[udder]]s.  Laum\u0117s were afraid of tools made from [[iron]].<ref name=ONE/>\n\nLaum\u0117s can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laum\u0117 was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laum\u0117 was a bride of thunder god [[Perk\u016bnas]]; however, they did not marry because Laum\u0117 fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania.  In other stories, the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laum\u0117 liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perk\u016bnas was a Laum\u0117 called [[Vaiva]]. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage, she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perk\u016bnas is angry and shouts in thunder.<ref name=ONE/> It was believed it is the rainbow that causes the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laum\u0117 fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meil\u0117' - love). Laum\u0117 descended to the sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into the highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laum\u0117s breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth.\n\nLaum\u0117s descended from the sky to Earth. They lived nearby lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Lots of names of water pools in Lithuania are named after the word Laum\u0117. Laum\u0117s liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in the night in New Moon or [[Full Moon]]. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like [[Fairy Ring]]) in the grass. Usually, Laum\u0117s were most powerful at Friday of [[New Moon]], at the rainiest days of the month in Lithuania. Laum\u0117s could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laum\u0117s song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in a circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.<ref>An encyclopedic dictionary of mythological and folkloric characters, epics, legends, etc. of most nations of the world, with particular attention to nations of the USSR.

The [[Rainbow]] was often called a ribbon lost by Laum\u0117s. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laum\u0117s usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women\u2019s work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two examples [[Folklore|folk tale]]s featuring Laum\u0117s:<ref name=TWO>Of Gods and Men: Studies in Lithuanian Mythology (Folklore Studies in Translation), Algirdas J.

She served her husband, who asked her \"Where\u2019s my son?\" With terror, she whispered, \"I have forgotten him!\" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laum\u00e9 speak: \"[[\u010ci\u016b\u010dia li\u016blia]], forgotten child.\" The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back.
