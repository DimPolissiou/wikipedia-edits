The prototype was first presented (at this stage as the ''Glas 1500'') in September 1963 at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. Later versions of the coup\u00e9 and cabriolet bodied Glas GT were also powered, in some cases, by the same engine as the saloon. The saloon was produced between August 1964 and December 1967, but the manufacturer never had the investment capital sufficiently to expand production capability and the model was discontinued after the by now badly indebted manufacturer was acquired by [[BMW]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Oswald |first=Werner |title=Deutsche Autos 1945-1990, volume 4 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |language=German |year=2001 |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |page=454 & 463}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Glas 1300 GT launched in 1963 had been developed by the [[Piedmont]]ese firm [[Pietro Frua|Frua]] of [[Moncalieri]], and a contract had at the same time been entered into for the development of a new middle class saloon. [[Pietro Frua|Frua]] had at this stage recently worked for the northern company [[Borgward]] to develop a successor for the company\u2019s [[Goliath 1100]], to be known as the Hansa 1300 (and sometimes incorrectly described as an intended successor to the successful [[Borgward Isabella]]). The Hansa 1300 project was a success for Frua even though, followed the bankruptcy of the Borgward business, the Hansa 1300 never entered volume production.\n\nThe car which Frua now developed for Glas was very similar to the still-born Hansa 1300. Both cars featured the [[Hofmeister kink]] which was gaining wider notability as a striking feature of new [[BMW]] designs in the 1960s and subsequently. Glas bored out their existing 1290 cc unit to give an increase in engine size to 1489 cc, and it was in this form that the car, with a claimed power output of 51&nbsp;kW (70 PS) was initially introduced to the public in September 1963.\n\n==1700==\n[[File:MHV BMW 2004 1973 01.jpg|280px|thumb|right|After BMW pulled the plug on Glas production in Germany, the car reappeared in South Africa sporting a BMW front and powered by a BMW engine.]]\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2015}}Not for the first time with a new model from Glas, the car introduced at the 1963 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] was far from ready for volume production. It became clear that the performance available from the 1489&nbsp;cc unit was insufficient for a middle-weight saloon with sporting aspirations. Similar conclusions had already been reached on the competitor from the rival manufacturer [[BMW]] who in 1961 had introduced the [[BMW New Class|BMW 1500]], a similarly sized sports saloon, only to introduce a more powerful version, the BMW&nbsp;1800, in 1963.\n\nA year after the launch of the Glas 1500 in September 1963, the car appeared as the Glas 1700, its engine size now further increased to 1682&nbsp;cc, and providing a claimed maximum power output of 59&nbsp;kW (80 PS) at 4,800&nbsp;rpm. A maximum speed of 150&nbsp;km/h (93&nbsp;mph) was quoted, and the option of automatic transmission was advertised, although the first car with an automatic gear box fitted would be produced only in 1966. By now series production had started, in August 1964, following the annual holiday shutdown, although volumes were still constrained by lack of cash for investment.\n\nA year later, in September 1965, claimed power from the standard engine increased further to 62.5&nbsp;kW (85 PS) at 4900&nbsp;rpm and the maximum speed to 155&nbsp;km/h (96&nbsp;mph).\n\n==1700 TS==\nThe 1965 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] also saw the introduction of the faster Glas 1700 TS. Engine capacity for the version was unchanged at 1682 cc, but the standard car\u2019s single carburetor was replaced with twin carburetors. The compression ratio increased in the configuration from the standard car\u2019s 1:8.5 to 1:9.5 or 1:9.7, suggesting the manufacturer was taking advantage of the wider availability of higher octane fuels which was a feature of motoring in much of western Europe at this time. For the 1700 TS maximum power was quoted as 74&nbsp;kW (100 PS) at 5,500 rpm and maximum speed cracked through the {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} threshold in non-metric countries at 170&nbsp;km/h (106&nbsp;mph)\n\n==The end==\nBMW took over Glas in 1966. The Glas 1700 competed directly with BMW\u2019s own BMW 1800 which was already being produced and sold in far greater volumes than Glas had achieved. BMW no doubt valued the engineering expertise that they acquired with the Glas business and they certainly valued the huge scope for expansion at the company\u2019s [[Dingolfing]] production site which during the 1960s was developed to become BMW\u2019s largest car plant. But BMW saw no reason to nurture the low volume product developed by the Glas business. By December 1967 the last Glas 1700 was produced.\n\n==Commercial==\nGlas were never able to afford the investment in production facilities and a dealership network that would have enabled the car to compete on level terms with the [[Opel Rekord]]  or the BMW 1800/2000.   Nevertheless, 13,792 Glas 1700 saloons were produced in Germany, including 928 of the higher performance 1700 TS models and 284 cars fitted with four-speed automatic transmission <ref>{{cite book|last=Oswald |first=Werner |title=Deutsche Autos 1945-1990, volume 4 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |language=German |year=2001 |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |page=463}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|1804|2004|SA|ZA|Cheetah}} Afterlives==\nWith Glas under BMW control, the model enjoyed an afterlife in [[South Africa]] where BMW models appeared combining the Frua-designed body of the Glas 1700 with BMW engines and underpinnings, and a BMW front later grafted onto the nose.

The river bends here, and the area is sheltered by trees that are perennially green.\n\n== History ==\nThe area was first inhabited over 7,000 years ago by natives drawn by the warm mineral spring. The spring, locally known as the \"Original [[Fountain of Youth]]\", attracted guests in the 19th century; there were more than a dozen hotels near the spring. Today the [[sulfur]]-scented spring water feeds an adjacent public swimming pool before flowing the short distance to the St. Johns River. The Green Cove Springs area was first developed by George J. F. Clarke in 1816 when he was provided land, under a Spanish land grant, to build a sawmill. Green Cove Springs was established in 1854 as White Sulfur Springs. Renamed in 1866, it became the Clay County seat in 1871.\n\n[[Image:SpringsGCS18.jpg|thumb|left|259px|The spring (1870s)]]\nAgriculture and tourism were two of the primary economic ventures until the end of the 19th century, when [[Henry Flagler]]'s railroad began taking tourists further south into Florida. In 1895, the [[Great Freeze]] destroyed the area's citrus crops, and tourism all but ended. The 1920s saw renewed development, with automobile traffic bringing in tourists again. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw the end of growth again for the city.\n\n[[File:Green Cove Springs VIA Historical Marker.jpg|thumb|Green Cove Springs, Florida Village Improvement Association Marker]]\nThe first women's club in the state of Florida was established in Green Cove Springs in 1883. The Village Improvement Association led local efforts to beautify the town, and established its first public library.<ref>{{cite web |title=Women Band Together to Clean Up the Town |url=http://claytoday.staging.communityq.com/stories/women-band-together-to-clean-up-the-town,10749 |website=Clay Today |publisher=Clay Today |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Village Improvement Association |url=http://archives.clayclerk.com/village-improvement-association/ |website=Clay County Historical Archives |publisher=Clay County Clerk of the Circuit Court |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe period immediately before and during World War II again brought new growth to Green Cove Springs. On September 11, 1940, the [[U.S. Navy]] opened '''Naval Air Station Lee Field''' in honor of Ensign Bejamin Lee who had lost his life in a crash at Killinghome, England, during World War I. In August 1943, the facility was renamed '''Naval Air Station Green Cove Springs''' and consisted of four {{convert|5000|ft|adj=on}} asphalt runways.<ref>United States Naval Aviation 1910 - 1980, NAVAIR 00-80P-1, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, c1981, p.465</ref><ref>http://wikimapia.org/#lat=29.9750111&lon=-81.6617203&z=14&l=0&m=a&v=2</ref>  One of the Marine Corps aviators training in the [[F4U Corsair]] Operational Training Unit at Lee Field in early 1945 was eventual television personality [[Ed McMahon]].<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/</ref>  After the war, NAS Green Cove Springs was downgraded in status to a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) as part of the greater [[NAS Jacksonville]] complex. A total of 13 piers were constructed along the west bank of the St. Johns River adjacent to NAAS Green Cove Springs to house a U.S. Navy [[United States Navy reserve fleets|\"Mothball Fleet\"]] of some 500 vessels, primarily [[destroyer]]s, destroyer escorts and fleet auxiliaries. In 1960, the Navy decommissioned NAAS Green Cove Springs and the pier facility. Some of the mothballed vessels were transferred to foreign navies, while others were relocated to other Reserve Fleet locations.\n\n[[Image:GCS1880s.jpg|thumb|left|259px|Cowboys with cattle in Green Cove Springs (1880s).]]\nIn 1984, the city annexed the former naval base into the city to utilize it for further growth and development as the Clay County Port and Reynolds Industrial Park. The air station is now a private airfield known as Reynolds Airpark (FAA airfield identifier '''FL60''') with a single {{convert|5000|ft|adj=on}} asphalt runway currently operational, although reportedly in poor condition.<ref>http://www.airport-data.com/airport/FL60/</ref><ref>http://www.airnav.com/airport/FL60</ref> Although the original air traffic control tower is still standing, attached to one of the former Navy aircraft hangars, the airfield remains an uncontrolled facility.\n\nGreen Cove Springs is the birthplace of [[Charles E. Merrill]] (1885\u20131956), one of the founders of [[Merrill Lynch]]. The town's spring is described by his son [[James Merrill]] in the poem \"Two From Florida\", published in ''[[The Inner Room]]'' (1988).\n\nGreen Cove Springs is also the birthplace of [[Augusta Savage]] (Augusta Christine Fells, February 29, 1892 - March 26, 1962). Savage was an African American sculptor associated with the [[Harlem Renaissance]].\n\nLocally, the community is known as the home of [[Gustafson's Farm]], a brand name of milk and dairy products sold throughout Florida. The main Gustafson Dairy Farm is located in Green Cove Springs and is one of the largest privately owned dairy farms in the southeastern United States. Started in 1908, the main farm occupies nearly {{convert|10000|acre|km2}} adjacent to the city limits. Gustafson's has many bottling plants across the state, stretching from [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] in the west to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Cocoa, Florida|Cocoa]] in the south. All Gustafson products have the picture of the husband-and-wife founders, Frank and Agnes Gustafson (also known as Mama and Papa Gus), who along with their first cow on their farm (named \"Buttercup\") are prominently featured on the packaging of the dairy's products.\n\nScenes for the 1971 \"B\" monster movie ''[[Zaat|Blood Waters of Dr. Z]]'' (or ''Zaat'') were filmed here. The movie was satirized on the television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n[[Image:OldClayCountyCourthouse13.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The Old Clay County Courthouse.]]\n\n=== Historic places ===\nThe following sites are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n* [[Clay County Courthouse (Florida)|Clay County Courthouse]]\n* [[Green Cove Springs Historic District]]\n* [[St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Green Cove Springs, Florida)|St. Mary's Church]]\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Green Cove Springs is structured in a city council/city manager form of government, with the council functioning as the governing body. The city has had this form of government since the 1980 charter revision.  The city council is composed of five members who are elected at large to three-year terms. The five-member council consists of the mayor, the vice mayor and three council members. The mayor and vice mayor are elected by the council and serve in these positions for one year. As the official representative of the city, the mayor is responsible for all intergovernmental relations and for presiding over all meetings of the council. The vice mayor serves as the presiding officer for all council meetings in the mayor's absence.\n\nThe Green Cove Springs Police Department provides full law enforcement services within the incorporated city limits of Green Cove Springs. The agency is headed by a chief of police with two lieutenants acting as division commanders. The department currently consists of 29 sworn officers, part-time and full-time dispatchers, an evidence custodian, an administrative secretary and two crossing guards. The agency has full-time officers assigned to the countywide Drug Task Force and Jacksonville Metro DEA Task Force, and also participates in the Clay County SWAT team. In addition to these specialized assignments, the police department is active in the North East Florida Intelligence Unit, North East Florida Burglary Detectives Unit, Northeast Florida Investigative Support Center, the Violent Crime Regional Coordinating Team, Sex Assault Task Force, and Domestic Violence Task Force.  \n \nThe department serves a diverse community and handled approximately 32,974 calls for service in 2011, with an average response time of 2 minutes for calls of an emergency nature. The department makes use of mobile data terminals (MDTs) in all of their patrol vehicles for reporting and obtaining information on the streets. All officers receive advanced training in law enforcement as well as career development.\n \nIn 2011, the police department became the first law enforcement agency in north east Florida to utilize red-light cameras. The agency is also known for programs such as North East Florida Camp Cadet and the Teen Summit.\n\nIn April 2014, the agency moved into a newly built police station / emergency operations center at 1001 Idlewild Avenue.\n\nThe city of Green Cove Springs contracts with the Clay County Fire-Rescue Department for fire/medical services.\n\n==Post office==\nA U.S. post office was established at [[Hibernia, Florida|Hibernia]] on June 19, 1849, but its name was changed on October 17, 1853, to Magnolia Mills, and on July 30, 1866, it was changed to Green Cove Springs. The Hibernia post office was reestablished on February 16, 1855, and remained open until May 15, 1931, when it was closed and the area assigned to Green Cove Springs.<ref>Bradbury, Alford G., and Hallock, E.

The river bends here, and the area is sheltered by trees that are perennially green.\n\n== History ==\nThe area was first inhabited over 7,000 years ago by natives drawn by the warm mineral spring. The spring, locally known as the \"Original [[Fountain of Youth]]\", attracted guests in the 19th century; there were more than a dozen hotels near the spring. Today the [[sulfur]]-scented spring water feeds an adjacent public swimming pool before flowing the short distance to the St. Johns River. The Green Cove Springs area was first developed by George J. F. Clarke in 1816 when he was provided land, under a Spanish land grant, to build a sawmill. Green Cove Springs was established in 1854 as White Sulfur Springs. Renamed in 1866, it became the Clay County seat in 1871.\n\n[[Image:SpringsGCS18.jpg|thumb|left|259px|The spring (1870s)]]\nAgriculture and tourism were two of the primary economic ventures until the end of the 19th century, when [[Henry Flagler]]'s railroad began taking tourists further south into Florida. In 1895, the [[Great Freeze]] destroyed the area's citrus crops, and tourism all but ended. The 1920s saw renewed development, with automobile traffic bringing in tourists again. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw the end of growth again for the city.\n\n[[File:Green Cove Springs VIA Historical Marker.jpg|thumb|Green Cove Springs, Florida Village Improvement Association Marker]]\nThe first women's club in the state of Florida was established in Green Cove Springs in 1883. The Village Improvement Association led local efforts to beautify the town, and established its first public library.<ref>{{cite web |title=Women Band Together to Clean Up the Town |url=http://claytoday.staging.communityq.com/stories/women-band-together-to-clean-up-the-town,10749 |website=Clay Today |publisher=Clay Today |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Village Improvement Association |url=http://archives.clayclerk.com/village-improvement-association/ |website=Clay County Historical Archives |publisher=Clay County Clerk of the Circuit Court |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe period immediately before and during World War II again brought new growth to Green Cove Springs. On September 11, 1940, the [[U.S. Navy]] opened '''Naval Air Station Lee Field''' in honor of Ensign Bejamin Lee who had lost his life in a crash at Killinghome, England, during World War I. In August 1943, the facility was renamed '''Naval Air Station Green Cove Springs''' and consisted of four {{convert|5000|ft|adj=on}} asphalt runways.<ref>United States Naval Aviation 1910 - 1980, NAVAIR 00-80P-1, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, c1981, p.465</ref><ref>http://wikimapia.org/#lat=29.9750111&lon=-81.6617203&z=14&l=0&m=a&v=2</ref>  One of the Marine Corps aviators training in the [[F4U Corsair]] Operational Training Unit at Lee Field in early 1945 was eventual television personality [[Ed McMahon]].<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/</ref>  After the war, NAS Green Cove Springs was downgraded in status to a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) as part of the greater [[NAS Jacksonville]] complex. A total of 13 piers were constructed along the west bank of the St. Johns River adjacent to NAAS Green Cove Springs to house a U.S. Navy [[United States Navy reserve fleets|\"Mothball Fleet\"]] of some 500 vessels, primarily [[destroyer]]s, destroyer escorts and fleet auxiliaries. In 1960, the Navy decommissioned NAAS Green Cove Springs and the pier facility. Some of the mothballed vessels were transferred to foreign navies, while others were relocated to other Reserve Fleet locations.\n\n[[Image:GCS1880s.jpg|thumb|left|259px|Cowboys with cattle in Green Cove Springs (1880s).]]\nIn 1984, the city annexed the former naval base into the city to utilize it for further growth and development as the Clay County Port and Reynolds Industrial Park. The air station is now a private airfield known as Reynolds Airpark (FAA airfield identifier '''FL60''') with a single {{convert|5000|ft|adj=on}} asphalt runway currently operational, although reportedly in poor condition.<ref>http://www.airport-data.com/airport/FL60/</ref><ref>http://www.airnav.com/airport/FL60</ref> Although the original air traffic control tower is still standing, attached to one of the former Navy aircraft hangars, the airfield remains an uncontrolled facility.\n\nGreen Cove Springs is the birthplace of [[Charles E. Merrill]] (1885\u20131956), one of the founders of [[Merrill Lynch]]. The town's spring is described by his son [[James Merrill]] in the poem \"Two From Florida\", published in ''[[The Inner Room]]'' (1988).\n\nGreen Cove Springs is also the birthplace of [[Augusta Savage]] (Augusta Christine Fells, February 29, 1892 - March 26, 1962). Savage was an African American sculptor associated with the [[Harlem Renaissance]].\n\nLocally, the community is known as the home of [[Gustafson's Farm]], a brand name of milk and dairy products sold throughout Florida. The main Gustafson Dairy Farm is located in Green Cove Springs and is one of the largest privately owned dairy farms in the southeastern United States. Started in 1908, the main farm occupies nearly {{convert|10000|acre|km2}} adjacent to the city limits. Gustafson's has many bottling plants across the state, stretching from [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] in the west to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Cocoa, Florida|Cocoa]] in the south. All Gustafson products have the picture of the husband-and-wife founders, Frank and Agnes Gustafson (also known as Mama and Papa Gus), who along with their first cow on their farm (named \"Buttercup\") are prominently featured on the packaging of the dairy's products.\n\nScenes for the 1971 \"B\" monster movie ''[[Zaat|Blood Waters of Dr. Z]]'' (or ''Zaat'') were filmed here. The movie was satirized on the television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n[[Image:OldClayCountyCourthouse13.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The Old Clay County Courthouse.]]\n\n=== Historic places ===\nThe following sites are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n* [[Clay County Courthouse (Florida)|Clay County Courthouse]]\n* [[Green Cove Springs Historic District]]\n* [[St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Green Cove Springs, Florida)|St. Mary's Church]]\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Green Cove Springs is structured in a city council/city manager form of government, with the council functioning as the governing body. The city has had this form of government since the 1980 charter revision.  The city council is composed of five members who are elected at large to three-year terms. The five-member council consists of the mayor, the vice mayor and three council members. The mayor and vice mayor are elected by the council and serve in these positions for one year. As the official representative of the city, the mayor is responsible for all intergovernmental relations and for presiding over all meetings of the council. The vice mayor serves as the presiding officer for all council meetings in the mayor's absence.\n\nThe Green Cove Springs Police Department provides full law enforcement services within the incorporated city limits of Green Cove Springs. The agency is headed by a chief of police with two lieutenants acting as division commanders. The department currently consists of 29 sworn officers, part-time and full time dispatchers, an evidence custodian, an administrative secretary and two crossing guards. The agency has full-time officers assigned to the countywide Drug Task Force and Jacksonville Metro DEA Task Force, and also participates in the Clay County SWAT team. In addition to these specialized assignments, the police department is active in the North East Florida Intelligence Unit, North East Florida Burglary Detectives Unit, Northeast Florida Investigative Support Center, the Violent Crime Regional Coordinating Team, Sex Assault Task Force, and Domestic Violence Task Force.  \n \nThe department serves a diverse community and handled approximately 32,974 calls for service in 2011, with an average response time of 2 minutes for calls of an emergency nature. The department makes use of mobile data terminals (MDTs) in all of their patrol vehicles for reporting and obtaining information on the streets. All officers receive advanced training in law enforcement as well as career development.\n \nIn 2011, the police department became the first law enforcement agency in north east Florida to utilize red-light cameras. The agency is also known for programs such as North East Florida Camp Cadet and the Teen Summit.\n\nIn April 2014, the agency moved into a newly built police station / emergency operations center at 1001 Idlewild Avenue.\n\nThe city of Green Cove Springs contracts with the Clay County Fire-Rescue Department for fire/medical services.\n\n==Post office==\nA U.S. post office was established at [[Hibernia, Florida|Hibernia]] on June 19, 1849, but its name was changed on October 17, 1853, to Magnolia Mills, and on July 30, 1866, it was changed to Green Cove Springs. The Hibernia post office was reestablished on February 16, 1855, and remained open until May 15, 1931, when it was closed and the area assigned to Green Cove Springs.<ref>Bradbury, Alford G., and Hallock, E.

In terms of cooperation structures, some agreements come very close to the relationship agreements concluded under articles 57 and 63 of the UN Charter with the specialized agencies, but due to Charter requirements that the agencies deal with \"economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and related fields\", organizations with such agreements are not formally specialized agencies of the United Nations.<ref>[http://www.unsceb.org/ceb/about/agreements/list List of Agreements between Specialized Agencies and the United Nations]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"CEB\">{{cite web |url=https://staff-direct.co.uk/ |title=Staffing Agency |date= |accessdate=2020-04-04 }}{date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: \"The Executive Heads of IAEA and WTO are invited to meetings of the CEB like any other specialized agency head.\"</ref><ref>[https://recruitment-agency.london/Recruitment Agency London{date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Published by the United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Organization Chart \u2013 United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination|url=https://www.unsystem.org/organizationchart|website=www.unsystem.org|language=en}}</ref><ref name=opcwdeal/><ref name=ICC/>  These organizations are termed Related Organizations by the UN.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.unsystem.org/members/related-organizations|title=DIRECTORY OF UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM ORGANIZATIONS \u2013 Related Organizations|accessdate=2018-10-08|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA established such an agreement with the UN in 1957, and the OPCW and the CTBTO used this model for agreements of their own with the UN.<ref name=opcwdeal>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9G6xaGx8fgC|title=The New Chemical Weapons Convention: Implementation and Prospects|editor1-last=Bothe|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Ronzitti|editor2-first=Natalino|editor3-last=Rosas|editor3-first=Allan|publisher=Kluwer Law International|date=1998|quote=The Organization is not a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN), but it will have a special relationship with it, to be organized on the basis of an agreement between the two organizations.

The IAEA's special relationship with the UN and UN SC is also specified in an agreement between the IAEA and the UN in 1957.  Under this agreement the IAEA cooperates with the Security Council by furnishing it, at its request, with such information and assistance as may be required in the exercise of its responsibility for maintenance or restoration of international peace and security.

The unapologetic slab-sided functionalism of the Kadett B disappointed some commentators.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, customers were not deterred, possibly because the simple car body enabled the car to provide an aggressively priced practical and modern car with far more interior space than the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] which hitherto had dominated the German small car market without serious challenge for more than a decade.\n\nThe range of bodies was widened with the Kadett B. The entry level model, priced in September 1965 at 5,175 [[Deutsche Mark|Marks]], was the two-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon). In addition, for the first time since 1940, it was again possible to buy a four-door Kadett \"Limousine\". In September 1967 a fast back \"Limousine\" model, designated as the \"Kadett LS\" and offered with two or four doors, joined the range.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 218</ref>\n\nA three-door \"Car-A-Van\" (kombi/estate/station wagon) was offered from the 1965 launch, with a five-door \"Car-A-Van\" added to the range in 1967.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 221</ref>\n\nOpel also offered a two-door Kadett coup\u00e9 with reduced headroom for the passengers in the rear. The coup\u00e9 body introduced in 1965 included a thick [[C-pillar]] with reduced side-windows between the C-pillar and the [[B-pillar]]. The thick C-pillar incorporated three prominent air extractor slots reminiscent of the gills on a fish, as a result of which this coup\u00e9 acquired the soubriquet ''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'' ([[gill|gills coup\u00e9]]). A coup\u00e9 body with larger side windows for the passengers in the back appeared in 1967 identified as the \"Coup\u00e9 F\", initially only on the more lavishly equipped cars, but from 1971 all Kadett B coup\u00e9s used the newer body. The newer Coup\u00e9, with an increased quantity of glass, was slightly heavier than the \"gills-coup\u00e9\" as well as being less aerodynamically efficient, leading to a small reduction in claimed top speed.\n\n==Engines==\n\n===Smaller OHV engines===\n\n====1.1-litre (1965\u20131973)====\nAt launch, and for the next two years till September 1967, all Kadett Bs were fitted with an [[Opel OHV engine|OHV four-cylinder \"over-square\" water-cooled engine]]. The unit followed the architecture of the 993&nbsp;cc engine first seen in the 1962 Kadett A, from which it was a development. Both engines featured a {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke, but for the engine in the Kadett B, generally referred to as a 1.1-litre or 1,100&nbsp;cc unit, the bore was increased by {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which made it even more [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] and resulted in a capacity increase to 1,078&nbsp;cc. There were as before two levels of power: stated output for the standard engine was {{Convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm, while the \"high-compression\" engine, listed as the \"1100 S\" motor, produced {{Convert|55|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm. Both engine versions were fitted with a Solex 35 PDSI carburetor, but the higher compression ratio on the {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit necessitated the use of higher octane \"super grade\" fuel.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 215</ref> There was also a \"low-compression\" {{Convert|40|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine used for certain export markets outside western Europe where available fuel came with a significantly lower octane rating than was normal for \"regular\" grade fuel in Germany.\n\nIn September 1967, as part of a larger proliferation of engine and trim options, a more powerful version of the 1,078&nbsp;cc engine became available, listed as the \"1100 SR\" motor, fitted with two  Solex 35 PDSI carburetors and providing a maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200&nbsp;rpm. The compression ratio was further raised, now to 9.2:1 and fitting the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit raised the claimed top speed to 140&nbsp;km/h (87&nbsp;mph) as against 125&nbsp;km/h (78&nbsp;mph) and 135&nbsp;km/h (84&nbsp;mph)  for the {{Convert|45|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadetts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHowever, the early 1970s saw increasing awareness of the dangers to health arising from [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] being added to road fuel, and the oil companies responded to the resulting political and regulatory pressures by reducing both the levels of [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] in fuel and the availability at filling stations of higher octane petrol/gasoline.   High-compression versions of the Opel 1,078&nbsp;cc engine were therefore withdrawn from August 1971, leaving just a {{Convert|50|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit which used the 7.8:1 compression ratio that had been used in the base version back in 1965, delivering a reduced torque (presumably as art of a tradeoff against higher power output).   Between August 1971 and July 1973 the niche hitherto occupied by the higher-compression 1,078&nbsp;cc units was filled by a newly bored out 1,196&nbsp;cc version of what was, in other respects, the engine much as before.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 221 & 222</ref>\n\nBy the time the Kadett B was replaced in 1973 there had been no fewer than six differently sized engines available for it from Opel: by far the most popular was the 1,078&nbsp;cc motor that powered 89% (2.3 million of 2.6 million) of the Kadett Bs produced.<ref name=osw216>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p. 216</ref>\n\n====1.2-litre (1971\u20131973)====\nThe 1.2-litre unit that, in the Kadett B, replaced in August 1971 the higher-compression versions of the 1.1-litre motor was listed as the \"1200 S\" motor. It retained the {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke of the original version of this engine, but the cylinder bore was further increased, giving an overall engine capacity of 1,196&nbsp;cc and maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 223</ref>\n\nOnly 95,000 Kadett Bs were fitted with the 1.2-litre engine which nevertheless went on to power successor Kadett and Corsa models until 1993. In the shorter term, in March 1972 this became the entry level power unit for base level versions of the recently introduced [[Opel Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 245, 246 & 246</ref>\n\n====1.0-litre (export only: 1972-1973)====\nIn 1972 and 1973 Opel produced 10,000 Kadett Bs powered by the 993&nbsp;cc original version of the engine that ten years earlier had powered the Kadett A. Maximum output, as previously, was {{Convert|40|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{Convert|48|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} according to the compression ratio selected. This engine was not fitted in cars destined for the domestic market, but was used for cars sold in export markets, primarily [[Italy]], where annual car tax rates increased very considerably for cars fitted with engines of above 1.0 litre.<ref name=osw216/> Kadetts assembled in South Africa received a 997&nbsp;cc Vauxhall engine and transmission.\n\n====1.2-litre Vauxhall engine (South Africa)====\nFrom circa 1966, General Motors South Africa built the Kadett B locally. However, to meet local parts content rules it was fitted with Vauxhall's 1159&nbsp;cc inline-four as also seen in the [[Vauxhall Viva|Viva]]. This engine offered {{convert|56.2|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|67|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in a high output version; the outputs are in Gross bhp.<ref name=CarZA768>{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = Kadett 4-door Car-A-Van | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | volume = 12 | number = 7 | date = August 1968 | ref = DNLCV | page = 13 | publisher = Central News Agency Ltd. | location = Cape Town, South Africa }}</ref> These local variants were also sold in [[South-West Africa]] (today's [[Namibia]]). From the second half of 1968, the four-door Car-A-Van model was added, alongside the updates to the rear suspension.<ref name=CarZA768/>\n\n===Larger Opel \"CIH\" engines===\n\n====1.7-litre (1967\u20131970)====\nIn 1967 [[Ford Germany|Ford]] added a 1.7-litre version to their [[Ford Taunus P6|Ford 12M/15M]] range.   Both the Kadett and the Ford by now took up more road space than a typical European 1.1-litre small family sedan, and in September 1967 Opel added a 1,698&nbsp;cc engine to the Kadett's range of available power units. A suitable unit already existed, having been fitted in the [[Opel Rekord Series B|Opel Rekord]] since 1965. The engine in question had been the manufacturer's second all-new engine design since the [[Second World War|war]], although much of its underlying philosophy came from [[General Motors]] developments in Detroit and from experience with the new engine developed for the Kadett A earlier in the 1960s. Opel's so-called [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine followed the trends of the time in replacing side-valves with an [[ohv|overhead valvegear]] configuration, which was no doubt facilitated by the [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] architecture of the cylinder block:  the engine also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders.   However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rods and rocker arms because, unusually (except within general Motors) the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves.   One reason for this may have been cosmetic.  Opel's CIH engine configuration enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. As on the smaller Kadett engines with their side-mounted camshafts, the \"in head\" camshaft on the Opel CIH engine was chain driven, a weight-saving option which reduced lumpiness and friction at higher engine speeds when compared with the [[Gear|gear-cogs]] which had been used to drive camshafts in the previous generation of Opel engines.\n\nThe engine, known as the 1.7S or 1700S, was listed for the Kadett only for three years, between September 1967 and August 1970. The lower-compression {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} version fitted in many [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekords]] was not offered to Kadett buyers. In the Kadett B the engine provided a maximum output of {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} employing a relatively high 9.5:1 compression ratio. That translated, in manual transmission cars, into a top speed of 153&nbsp;km/h (95&nbsp;mph) or 155&nbsp;km/h (96&nbsp;mph) according to body type. Despite its being listed for three years, only 6,000 Kadetts with the 1,698&nbsp;cc engine were produced, suggesting that the manufacturer preferred to fit engines of this size in their larger [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekord model]] (which between 1966 and 1971 took more than half a million of the 1,698&nbsp;cc units), while persuading Kadett customers looking for more power to switch their preference to the (in most respects similar) 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the CIH engine.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 216, 219 & 228</ref>\n\n====1.9-litre (1967\u20131973)====\nAlso listed from 1967, and fitted in 143,000 Kadett Bs was the 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine. Again, only the high-compression version of the engine was listed for the Kadett, providing maximum output of {{Convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,100 rpm, using a 9.5:1 compression ratio. After August 1971 the compression ratio was reduced to 9.0:1 due to the reduction in octane levels available at filling stations. In practice, though the engine was listed for the Kadett B until 1973, very few of the Kadetts produced in 1972 and 1973 were fitted with it as the focus of dealers' and customers' attention switched to the manufacturer's newer [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 219</ref>\n\nThe 1.9-litre engine was fitted in the top of the range \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" as an alternative to the smaller high-compression 1.2-litre engine also offered for this sportingly attired variant, readily identifiable from the thick black side stripe and the black paint on the lid of the bonnet/hood.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214, 218, 219 & 220</ref>\n\nIn Germany the \"1900 S\" engine was offered only in the coup\u00e9-bodied \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" although for certain export markets, notably the USA, this engine was available in all body versions offered.\n\nBetween April 1970 and the end of the Kadett B's model life a more highly tuned \"HL\" (\u201eHochleistung\u201c/''\"High powered\"'') version of the 1.9-litre engine could be fitted to a Rallye Sprint version of the car, power further increased to {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. \"Hochleistung\" cars could be purchased from Opel dealers and from at least one specialist engine tuning business, but they never appeared on Opel price lists in Germany where the cars were always rare. The {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadett B Rallye Sprint was less of a rarity in [[Sweden]] where a high proportion of the cars produced were sold.\n\n====1.5-litre (export only: 1967-1970)====\nThe smallest of Opel's [[:de:Opel CIH|(CIH)]] engines never found its way into Kadetts for the domestic market, but the 1,492&nbsp;cc unit was installed in 44,000 Kadett saloons/sedans and estates/station wagons destined for export between 1967 and 1970, primarily for Austria, Sweden and the USA (where it was only offered for the 1968 model year). The version fitted in the Kadetts was a {{Convert|65|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} high-compression unit.\n\n==Running gear==\n\n===Transmission===\nThe car came with a four-speed all-synchromesh manual transmission as standard, gear selection being performed using a centrally positioned floor-mounted lever.   From November 1968 on the larger-engined cars, and from February 1969 also on the smaller-engined Kadetts, it became possible to specify the alternative of a \"GM Strasbourg\" [[Turbo-Hydramatic 180]] three-speed automatic transmission, available at the extra cost (initially) of 800 Marks.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Brakes===\nThe Kadett B was the first Kadett to offer disc brakes on the front wheels.   {{convert|238|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter disc brakes at the front came included as standard fittings on all but the cheapest versions, complemented by {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter drum brakes at the back.   The brakes were controlled hydraulically.   From February 1967 the single hydraulic braking circuit was replaced by a dual circuit braking system:  this built in reserve of redundancy in the braking control system reflected a growing interest in primary and secondary safety which was becoming a feature of German auto-design in the 1960s.   Whether as an option on the base model or as a standard feature across the rest of the range, where disc brakes were fitted Opel also included servo-assistance in the braking system from February 1967.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 219, 221-223</ref>\n\n===Steering and suspension===\nThe Kadett B inherited its suspension from the Kadett A.   Two years after launch, however, in August 1967, the simple longitudinally mounted leaf springs with a centrally connected rigid axle which till then had suspended the rear wheels were replaced with a more sophisticated set-up incorporating coil springs, trailing arms and a [[Panhard rod]].   Road holding was usefully improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>   At the same time, reflecting growing preoccupation with secondary safety in the marketplace, the old steering wheel was replaced with a padded \"Safety\" steering wheel, now mounted on a telescopic steering column which was designed to collapse in the event of a serious collision.\n\n==Versions and trim levels==\n\n===standard \"Kadett\", \"Kadett L\" and \"Kadett LS\"===\nThe basic car was known simply as the Opel Kadett or the \u201cstandard\u201d Opel Kadett, but for a few hundred Marks more customers could choose an Opel Kadett \u201cL\u201d with a less Spartan interior and a little more chrome on the outside, along with over-riders on the bumpers.    When the fastback saloon was offered, between 1967 and 1970, it was identified as the Kadett \u201cLS\u201d.\n\n===\u201cRallye Kadett\u201d===\nThe \u201cRallye Kadett\u201d was offered only with the coup\u00e9 body, which it combined with the twin carburettor \u201cSR\u201d  version of the 1.1-litre engine (between 1965 and 1971) or the high-compression 1.9-litre engine (between 1967 and 1973).   The Rallye Kadett came with twin halogen driving lights and, on the inside, a black panel of rocker switches as part of the dash-board along with black synthetic leather seat coverings.   It also came with matte black panels on the bonnet/hood (\u201cto reduce reflection\u201d) and black stripes along the side.   Customers worried by the flamboyant look of all the black paint could order a Rallye Kadett without it, but very few Rallye Kadett buyers opted for the \u201cunderstated\u201d paintwork option.\n\n===Opel Olympia===\n{{main|Opel Olympia}}\n[[File:1968-Opel-Olympia.jpg|thumb|1968 Opel Olympia 2-door sedan, with the standard vinyl roof]]\n\nThe Olympia name was revived in 1967. This time it was only a luxury version of the contemporary [[Opel Kadett B]]. Interior finishings were of a higher order than in the Kadett. Engines were an 1100&nbsp;cc unit with {{convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} taken from the Kadett and two larger units, a 1700&nbsp;cc with {{convert|75|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 1900&nbsp;cc with {{convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} which were normally used in the [[Opel Rekord]].<ref name=WC68>{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1968 | editor-last = d'Angelo | editor-first = Sergio | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | page = 664 | year = 1968 }}</ref> The bodywork was of the \"fastback\" style, rather than of the more upright regular sedan-style bodywork used on most Kadetts. The Olympia was not highly successful and was replaced in 1970 by the all new [[Opel Ascona]].\n\n===Limited edition \"run-out\" specials===\nThe Kadett B was in production for 8 years, which represented a longer production run than was achieved by any other Kadett before or subsequently.   This freed up the manufacturer to focus new model development on the important [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models which appeared in 1970.   The Kadett B's strong marketplace performance was helped by the lukewarm reception German buyers gave to the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] which in its original incarnation German buyers perceived as cramped, crude and uncomfortable.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 396 & 397: \"Der grossere Teil der Produktion ging ins Ausland, weil der Ford Escort [Mk I] auf dem deutschen Markt wegen seiner pummeligen Form, seiner simplen Konstruktion, seiner holprigen Stra\u00dfenlage und seines bescheidenen Komforts nur m\u00e4\u00dfigen Zuspruch fand...   848 388 [Escort Mk Is fertigten] die deutschen Ford-Werke, doch nur 234 667 Exemplaren fanden deutsche K\u00e4ufer.\"</ref>   At the end of 1972, with rumours of a replacement appearing in the trade press, Opel nevertheless felt it necessary to prepare a series of special edition Opel Kadetts with a number of \"options\" included as standard features, but with little chance for customers to vary the specifications.   By building large batches of identically equipped cars the manufacturer was able to provide attractively low prices to customers prepared to forego the chance to specify their Kadett \"\u00e0 la carte\" from the colour, trim and options lists.   Forty years on, some of the options listed have become standard on cars of this class, while others have fallen completely out of favour.\n\nThe limited edition cars were built and sold for the 1973 model year, which was the Kadett B's run-out (or final) year.\n\n====Kadett Sport (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Sport came with matte black exterior decor reminiscent of the Kadett Rallye, but whereas the Kadett Rallye came with a coupe body the Kadett-Sport used only the two-door \"Limousine\" sedan/saloon body.   Also the recommended price was 1,171 Marks (12%) lower than for the similarly powered 1.2-litre {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} Kadett Rallye.\n\nThe Kadett-Sport buyer could specify any one of three eye-catching body colours: \"roof-tile red\", \"yellow ochre\" and \"lemon yellow\"  ''(Ziegelrot, Ocker und Citrusgelb)''.   Appropriate features included in the \"customer-friendly\" price were a sports exhaust/muffler, the rallye gauge cluster from the Rallye model, a sports steering wheel, servo assisted brakes with discs at the front, anti-roll bars, high-backed front seats, sports wheels and tires, a heated rear window, seat belts and, under the bonnet, an enhanced alternator to cope with the anticipated demands of additional electrical equipment.\n\n====Kadett Holiday (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Holiday came with a standard package of extras, chief among which were a steel sliding sun roof, sports wheels, large fog lights at the front ''and'' a rear fog light, and high-backed front seats incorporating stylish wrap-around head restraints.\n\n====Kadett Festival (1973)====\nThe most luxuriously equipped of the special edition Kadetts of 1973, the Festival could be purchased as a Limousine (sedan/saloon) or as a Coup\u00e9.   The cars were powered by the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.2S engine, and for approximately an extra 500 Marks the 3-speed automatic \"Strasbourg\" transmission could be specified.\n\nThe Kadett-Festival buyer could choose from three fashionably metallic body colours: \"sahara gold\", \"monza blue\" and \"lime green\".   \"Extras\" included as standard features in the \"friendly\" price were velour covered seats exclusive to the Kadett Festival, a sports steering wheel, front disc brakes packaged with servo-assistance for the brakes, anti-roll bars front and rear, a more powerful alternator than on most Kadetts, halogen spot lamps, a heated back window, sports wheels with radial tires and the external decoration of thin twin side-stripes.\n\n====Kadett Grand Prix (1973)====\nThe Kadett Grand Prix was a special edition Kadett using the two-door Limousine (sedan/saloon) body with its interior enhanced by the fitting of carpets, a sports steering wheel and 3-point mounted seatbelts.   Under the bonnet/hood, there was an uprated alternator.   The 3-speed automatic transmission could be ordered as an extra.\n\nFor most of the run-out specials, customers were restricted to a choice of three body colours, but Grand Prix buyers could choose from between roof-til red, yellow ochre, sierra beige and arctic white.\n\n===Export specials===\n\n====Opel Ascona (modified Kadett B assembled in Biel, [[Switzerland]])====\nThe Opel Ascona 1700 should not be confused with the all-new [[Opel Ascona]] introduced in 1970.   The \"Opel Ascona\" name was originally used for a 4-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon)-bodied edition of the Kadett B powered by the manufacturer's 1,698&nbsp;cc [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] high compression ratio \"1.7S\" engine.   The interior was extensively modified, and incorporated several elements from the Kadett's \"L\" equipment package.   Opel's first four Asconas came from the Kadett plant in [[Bochum]], but all the rest of the 2,560 Kadett-based cars were assembled at [[Biel]], near the Franco-German [[Languages of Switzerland|language frontier]] through central Switzerland, using imported components.   [[General Motors]] had originally established their small auto-assembly facility in Biel in the 1930s as a reaction to a surge in [[Mercantilism|trade protectionism]] which had been part of the political reaction in Europe and America to the [[Great Depression|economic depression]] of the early 1930s.\n\n====Mixed fortunes in the [[US]]====\nThe Kadett B was sold in the United States through a large number of selected [[Buick]] dealers from 1966 until Autumn 1972 ( 72 models were only imported by special order by the dealer ), branded simply as the '''Opel''' in the 1970 and 71 model years. The U.S. models from the 1968 model year were given the front end and trim similar to the new [[Opel Olympia]] with the turn signals put into the grille beside the headlights ( as opposed to under them like the Olympia ).   From 1969 additional lighting changes were made to include side marker lights ( The 1968 had side marker reflectors ) on the front fender and larger wrap-around tail lights that were unique to the US Market to meet new US regulations.   The US cars also received sealed-beam headlights at the front, and the car took part in the [[Trans-Am Series]] during its commercial life.   The Kadett Bs, like the predecessor Kadett A, were technically simple cars whose task was to compete with the market leader, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].   The mainstay of the US Kadett at this time was the coupe-bodied fast back and station wagon/caravan. Sedans and specifically the four-door sedan were offered only sporadically. In the case of the four door it was only offered in the 1967 ( All were 1.1L and trim matched the European Opel Kadett of the time ) and 1971 model years ( All were 1.9L and less than 700 were imported and sold ).\n\nRoughly 430,000 Opel Kadett Bs were imported to the U.S.\n\nThe [[United States]] car magazine ''[[Car and Driver]]'' published a highly critical test of an ''Opel Kadett L 1500 Caravan'' in February 1968, featuring photos of the car in a junkyard. Reportedly, GM withdrew ads from that magazine for several months as a consequence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kf0zqDyLgBkC&pg=PA191 |title=Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech |first=Richard L. |last=Abel |page=191 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nBetween 1965 and 1973 Opel produced 2,691,300 Kadett Bs<ref name=\"OldtimerKatalogNr23\"/> making this model one of the most successful Opels to date in terms of sales volume.   The Kadett benefitted on the domestic market from a progressive slowing of demand for the old [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], while the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Volkswagen Golf]] which would compete for sales more effectively against the Kadett C both got off to a relatively slow start respectively in 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe two-seat [[Opel GT]] was heavily based on Kadett B components, its body made by a French contractor, [[Brissonneau & Lotz]], at their [[Creil]] factory.\n\n{{gallery | width = 190 | height = 113\n|File:1967 Opel Kadett L Coup\u00e9 (US), rear right, Hershey 2019.jpg|US-market 1967 Opel Kadett B \"[[Gill|Gills-coup\u00e9]]\" (''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'')\n|File:Kadett 1700 Front.JPG|Opel Kadett B 4-door Limousine\n|File:Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 F front 20110811.jpg|Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 \"F\" (1967-73)\n|File:Opel Kadett B BW 2016-07-17 13-28-59.jpg|Opel Kadett B \"LS\" Fastback sedan/saloon (1967-70)\n|File:Kadett B Kombi rear 23072007.jpg|Rear-view of Opel Kadett B 3-door Caravan (Kombi) (1965-73)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, front right.jpg|US-market 1971 Opel Kadett 36D (4 Door)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, rear left.jpg|Rear view, showing the US-only tail lights used from 1969 until 1971 \n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Opel}}\n{{Classic Opel timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Opel vehicles|Kadett B]]\n[[Category:Compact cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox automobile\n|image         = File:Opel Kadett B Westhausen 2015.JPG\n|caption       = Opel Kadett B 2-door Limousine\n|manufacturer  = [[Opel]] ([[General Motors]])\n|name          = Opel Kadett B\n|production    = 1965\u20131973\n|class         = [[Small family car]] ([[C-segment|C]])\n|body_style    = {{unbulleted list | 2/4-door notchback / fastback [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] | 3/5-door [[Station wagon|\"Car-A-Van\" estate]] | 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] }}\n|engine        = 1972-73: 993&nbsp;cc 40/48 PS [[Opel OHV engine|ohv]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (export)<br>1965-73: 1078&nbsp;cc 45/50/55/60 PS [[Opel OHV engine|ohv]] I4<br>1971-73: 1196&nbsp;cc 60 PS [[Opel OHV engine|ohv]] I4<br>1967-70: 1492&nbsp;cc 65 PS [[:de:Opel CIH|CIH]] I4 (export)<br>1967-70: 1698&nbsp;cc 75 PS [[:de:Opel CIH|CIH]] I4<br>1967-73: 1897&nbsp;cc 90/106 PS [[:de:Opel CIH|CIH]] I4<br>([[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline engines]])\n|assembly      = {{ubl\n  |West Germany: [[Bochum]]\n  | [[Johor Bahru]], [[Malaysia]] ({{abbr|Capital Motor|Capital Motor Assembly Corporation}})<ref name=leeps1>{{cite journal |author=Leeps |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19890604&id=tKFUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5932,900833&hl=en | title = Rust Busters | journal = [[New Straits Times]] | page = New Sunday Times, 21 |date=1989-06-04 |accessdate=2020-03-26 }}</ref>\n  }}\n|transmission  =\n|length        = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|4100|mm|in|abbr=on}} (estate) | {{convert|4105|mm|in|abbr=on}} (sedan) | {{convert|4182|mm|in|abbr=on}} (coup\u00e9, fastback) }}\n|width         = {{convert|1573|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|height        = {{convert|1274|mm|in|abbr=on}}<br> to {{convert|1405|mm|in|abbr=on}}<br>(according to wheel size and body type)\n|weight        =\n|wheelbase     = {{convert|2416|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|related       = [[Opel Olympia]] A \n|predecessor   = [[Opel Kadett A]]\n|successor     = [[Opel Kadett C]]\n}}\nThe '''[[Opel Kadett]] B''' is a car that was launched by [[Opel]] at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in late summer 1965.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23>{{citation |first=G\u00fcnther | last = Zink | title =Oldtimer Katalog |volume=23|page=265|date =2009 |isbn=978-3868520675 | language = German | publisher=HEEL Verlag |location=K\u00f6nigswinter }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last= Oswald |first= Werner |year= 2003 |title= Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990 | trans-title = German cars, 1945-1990 |volume= 3 |publisher= Motorbuch Verlag |language= German |isbn= 3-613-02116-1 | page = 213 | ref= Oswald Band 3}}</ref> The Kadett B was larger all-round than the [[Opel Kadett A|Kadett A]]: 5% longer both overall and in terms of the wheelbase, 7% wider and 9% heavier (unladen weight), albeit {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} lower in basic standard \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon) form.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 199 & 215</ref> Production ended in July 1973, with the [[Opel Kadett C|successor model]] introduced a month later following the summer shut-down, in August.\n\n==Bodies: more choice==\n[[File:Kadett-varia.JPG|thumb|Opel Kadett B body options]]\n\nOpel had built a reputation for providing stylish cars, and the simple well balanced proportions of the recently introduced [[Opel Rekord Series A]] had continued the tradition. The unapologetic slab-sided functionalism of the Kadett B disappointed some commentators.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, customers were not deterred, possibly because the simple car body enabled the car to provide an aggressively priced practical and modern car with far more interior space than the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] which hitherto had dominated the German small car market without serious challenge for more than a decade.\n\nThe range of bodies was widened with the Kadett B. The entry level model, priced in September 1965 at 5,175 [[Deutsche Mark|Marks]], was the two-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon). In addition, for the first time since 1940, it was again possible to buy a four-door Kadett \"Limousine\". In September 1967 a fast back \"Limousine\" model, designated as the \"Kadett LS\" and offered with two or four doors, joined the range.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 218</ref>\n\nA three-door \"Car-A-Van\" (kombi/estate/station wagon) was offered from the 1965 launch, with a five-door \"Car-A-Van\" added to the range in 1967.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 221</ref>\n\nOpel also offered a two-door Kadett coup\u00e9 with reduced headroom for the passengers in the rear. The coup\u00e9 body introduced in 1965 included a thick [[C-pillar]] with reduced side-windows between the C-pillar and the [[B-pillar]]. The thick C-pillar incorporated three prominent air extractor slots reminiscent of the gills on a fish, as a result of which this coup\u00e9 acquired the soubriquet ''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'' ([[gill|gills coup\u00e9]]). A coup\u00e9 body with larger side windows for the passengers in the back appeared in 1967 identified as the \"Coup\u00e9 F\", initially only on the more lavishly equipped cars, but from 1971 all Kadett B coup\u00e9s used the newer body. The newer Coup\u00e9, with an increased quantity of glass, was slightly heavier than the \"gills-coup\u00e9\" as well as being less aerodynamically efficient, leading to a small reduction in claimed top speed.\n\n==Engines==\n\n===Smaller OHV engines===\n\n====1.1-litre (1965\u20131973)====\nAt launch, and for the next two years till September 1967, all Kadett Bs were fitted with an [[Opel OHV engine|OHV four-cylinder \"over-square\" water-cooled engine]]. The unit followed the architecture of the 993&nbsp;cc engine first seen in the 1962 Kadett A, from which it was a development. Both engines featured a {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke, but for the engine in the Kadett B, generally referred to as a 1.1-litre or 1,100&nbsp;cc unit, the bore was increased by {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which made it even more [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] and resulted in a capacity increase to 1,078&nbsp;cc. There were as before two levels of power: stated output for the standard engine was {{Convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm, while the \"high-compression\" engine, listed as the \"1100 S\" motor, produced {{Convert|55|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm. Both engine versions were fitted with a Solex 35 PDSI carburetor, but the higher compression ratio on the {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit necessitated the use of higher octane \"super grade\" fuel.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 215</ref> There was also a \"low-compression\" {{Convert|40|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine used for certain export markets outside western Europe where available fuel came with a significantly lower octane rating than was normal for \"regular\" grade fuel in Germany.\n\nIn September 1967, as part of a larger proliferation of engine and trim options, a more powerful version of the 1,078&nbsp;cc engine became available, listed as the \"1100 SR\" motor, fitted with two  Solex 35 PDSI carburetors and providing a maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200&nbsp;rpm. The compression ratio was further raised, now to 9.2:1 and fitting the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit raised the claimed top speed to 140&nbsp;km/h (87&nbsp;mph) as against 125&nbsp;km/h (78&nbsp;mph) and 135&nbsp;km/h (84&nbsp;mph)  for the {{Convert|45|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadetts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHowever, the early 1970s saw increasing awareness of the dangers to health arising from [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] being added to road fuel, and the oil companies responded to the resulting political and regulatory pressures by reducing both the levels of [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] in fuel and the availability at filling stations of higher octane petrol/gasoline.   High-compression versions of the Opel 1,078&nbsp;cc engine were therefore withdrawn from August 1971, leaving just a {{Convert|50|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit which used the 7.8:1 compression ratio that had been used in the base version back in 1965, delivering a reduced torque (presumably as art of a tradeoff against higher power output).   Between August 1971 and July 1973 the niche hitherto occupied by the higher-compression 1,078&nbsp;cc units was filled by a newly bored out 1,196&nbsp;cc version of what was, in other respects, the engine much as before.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 221 & 222</ref>\n\nBy the time the Kadett B was replaced in 1973 there had been no fewer than six differently sized engines available for it from Opel: by far the most popular was the 1,078&nbsp;cc motor that powered 89% (2.3 million of 2.6 million) of the Kadett Bs produced.<ref name=osw216>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p. 216</ref>\n\n====1.2-litre (1971\u20131973)====\nThe 1.2-litre unit that, in the Kadett B, replaced in August 1971 the higher-compression versions of the 1.1-litre motor was listed as the \"1200 S\" motor. It retained the {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke of the original version of this engine, but the cylinder bore was further increased, giving an overall engine capacity of 1,196&nbsp;cc and maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 223</ref>\n\nOnly 95,000 Kadett Bs were fitted with the 1.2-litre engine which nevertheless went on to power successor Kadett and Corsa models until 1993. In the shorter term, in March 1972 this became the entry level power unit for base level versions of the recently introduced [[Opel Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 245, 246 & 246</ref>\n\n====1.0-litre (export only: 1972-1973)====\nIn 1972 and 1973 Opel produced 10,000 Kadett Bs powered by the 993&nbsp;cc original version of the engine that ten years earlier had powered the Kadett A. Maximum output, as previously, was {{Convert|40|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{Convert|48|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} according to the compression ratio selected. This engine was not fitted in cars destined for the domestic market, but was used for cars sold in export markets, primarily [[Italy]], where annual car tax rates increased very considerably for cars fitted with engines of above 1.0 litre.<ref name=osw216/> Kadetts assembled in South Africa received a 997&nbsp;cc Vauxhall engine and transmission.\n\n====1.2-litre Vauxhall engine (South Africa)====\nFrom circa 1966, General Motors South Africa built the Kadett B locally. However, to meet local parts content rules it was fitted with Vauxhall's 1159&nbsp;cc inline-four as also seen in the [[Vauxhall Viva|Viva]]. This engine offered {{convert|56.2|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|67|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in a high output version; the outputs are in Gross bhp.<ref name=CarZA768>{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = Kadett 4-door Car-A-Van | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | volume = 12 | number = 7 | date = August 1968 | ref = DNLCV | page = 13 | publisher = Central News Agency Ltd. | location = Cape Town, South Africa }}</ref> These local variants were also sold in [[South-West Africa]] (today's [[Namibia]]). From the second half of 1968, the four-door Car-A-Van model was added, alongside the updates to the rear suspension.<ref name=CarZA768/>\n\n===Larger Opel \"CIH\" engines===\n\n====1.7-litre (1967\u20131970)====\nIn 1967 [[Ford Germany|Ford]] added a 1.7-litre version to their [[Ford Taunus P6|Ford 12M/15M]] range.   Both the Kadett and the Ford by now took up more road space than a typical European 1.1-litre small family sedan, and in September 1967 Opel added a 1,698&nbsp;cc engine to the Kadett's range of available power units. A suitable unit already existed, having been fitted in the [[Opel Rekord Series B|Opel Rekord]] since 1965. The engine in question had been the manufacturer's second all-new engine design since the [[Second World War|war]], although much of its underlying philosophy came from [[General Motors]] developments in Detroit and from experience with the new engine developed for the Kadett A earlier in the 1960s. Opel's so-called [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine followed the trends of the time in replacing side-valves with an [[ohv|overhead valvegear]] configuration, which was no doubt facilitated by the [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] architecture of the cylinder block:  the engine also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders.   However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rods and rocker arms because, unusually (except within general Motors) the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves.   One reason for this may have been cosmetic.  Opel's CIH engine configuration enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. As on the smaller Kadett engines with their side-mounted camshafts, the \"in head\" camshaft on the Opel CIH engine was chain driven, a weight-saving option which reduced lumpiness and friction at higher engine speeds when compared with the [[Gear|gear-cogs]] which had been used to drive camshafts in the previous generation of Opel engines.\n\nThe engine, known as the 1.7S or 1700S, was listed for the Kadett only for three years, between September 1967 and August 1970. The lower-compression {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} version fitted in many [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekords]] was not offered to Kadett buyers. In the Kadett B the engine provided a maximum output of {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} employing a relatively high 9.5:1 compression ratio. That translated, in manual transmission cars, into a top speed of 153&nbsp;km/h (95&nbsp;mph) or 155&nbsp;km/h (96&nbsp;mph) according to body type. Despite its being listed for three years, only 6,000 Kadetts with the 1,698&nbsp;cc engine were produced, suggesting that the manufacturer preferred to fit engines of this size in their larger [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekord model]] (which between 1966 and 1971 took more than half a million of the 1,698&nbsp;cc units), while persuading Kadett customers looking for more power to switch their preference to the (in most respects similar) 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the CIH engine.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 216, 219 & 228</ref>\n\n====1.9-litre (1967\u20131973)====\nAlso listed from 1967, and fitted in 143,000 Kadett Bs was the 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine. Again, only the high-compression version of the engine was listed for the Kadett, providing maximum output of {{Convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,100 rpm, using a 9.5:1 compression ratio. After August 1971 the compression ratio was reduced to 9.0:1 due to the reduction in octane levels available at filling stations. In practice, though the engine was listed for the Kadett B until 1973, very few of the Kadetts produced in 1972 and 1973 were fitted with it as the focus of dealers' and customers' attention switched to the manufacturer's newer [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 219</ref>\n\nThe 1.9-litre engine was fitted in the top of the range \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" as an alternative to the smaller high-compression 1.2-litre engine also offered for this sportingly attired variant, readily identifiable from the thick black side stripe and the black paint on the lid of the bonnet/hood.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214, 218, 219 & 220</ref>\n\nIn Germany the \"1900 S\" engine was offered only in the coup\u00e9-bodied \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" although for certain export markets, notably the USA, this engine was available in all body versions offered.\n\nBetween April 1970 and the end of the Kadett B's model life a more highly tuned \"HL\" (\u201eHochleistung\u201c/''\"High powered\"'') version of the 1.9-litre engine could be fitted to a Rallye Sprint version of the car, power further increased to {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. \"Hochleistung\" cars could be purchased from Opel dealers and from at least one specialist engine tuning business, but they never appeared on Opel price lists in Germany where the cars were always rare. The {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadett B Rallye Sprint was less of a rarity in [[Sweden]] where a high proportion of the cars produced were sold.\n\n====1.5-litre (export only: 1967-1970)====\nThe smallest of Opel's [[:de:Opel CIH|(CIH)]] engines never found its way into Kadetts for the domestic market, but the 1,492&nbsp;cc unit was installed in 44,000 Kadett saloons/sedans and estates/station wagons destined for export between 1967 and 1970, primarily for Austria, Sweden and the USA (where it was only offered for the 1968 model year). The version fitted in the Kadetts was a {{Convert|65|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} high-compression unit.\n\n==Running gear==\n\n===Transmission===\nThe car came with a four-speed all-synchromesh manual transmission as standard, gear selection being performed using a centrally positioned floor-mounted lever.   From November 1968 on the larger-engined cars, and from February 1969 also on the smaller-engined Kadetts, it became possible to specify the alternative of a \"GM Strasbourg\" [[Turbo-Hydramatic 180]] three-speed automatic transmission, available at the extra cost (initially) of 800 Marks.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Brakes===\nThe Kadett B was the first Kadett to offer disc brakes on the front wheels.   {{convert|238|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter disc brakes at the front came included as standard fittings on all but the cheapest versions, complemented by {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter drum brakes at the back.   The brakes were controlled hydraulically.   From February 1967 the single hydraulic braking circuit was replaced by a dual circuit braking system:  this built in reserve of redundancy in the braking control system reflected a growing interest in primary and secondary safety which was becoming a feature of German auto-design in the 1960s.   Whether as an option on the base model or as a standard feature across the rest of the range, where disc brakes were fitted Opel also included servo-assistance in the braking system from February 1967.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 219, 221-223</ref>\n\n===Steering and suspension===\nThe Kadett B inherited its suspension from the Kadett A.   Two years after launch, however, in August 1967, the simple longitudinally mounted leaf springs with a centrally connected rigid axle which till then had suspended the rear wheels were replaced with a more sophisticated set-up incorporating coil springs, trailing arms and a [[Panhard rod]].   Road holding was usefully improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>   At the same time, reflecting growing preoccupation with secondary safety in the marketplace, the old steering wheel was replaced with a padded \"Safety\" steering wheel, now mounted on a telescopic steering column which was designed to collapse in the event of a serious collision.\n\n==Versions and trim levels==\n\n===standard \"Kadett\", \"Kadett L\" and \"Kadett LS\"===\nThe basic car was known simply as the Opel Kadett or the \u201cstandard\u201d Opel Kadett, but for a few hundred Marks more customers could choose an Opel Kadett \u201cL\u201d with a less Spartan interior and a little more chrome on the outside, along with over-riders on the bumpers.    When the fastback saloon was offered, between 1967 and 1970, it was identified as the Kadett \u201cLS\u201d.\n\n===\u201cRallye Kadett\u201d===\nThe \u201cRallye Kadett\u201d was offered only with the coup\u00e9 body, which it combined with the twin carburettor \u201cSR\u201d  version of the 1.1-litre engine (between 1965 and 1971) or the high-compression 1.9-litre engine (between 1967 and 1973).   The Rallye Kadett came with twin halogen driving lights and, on the inside, a black panel of rocker switches as part of the dash-board along with black synthetic leather seat coverings.   It also came with matte black panels on the bonnet/hood (\u201cto reduce reflection\u201d) and black stripes along the side.   Customers worried by the flamboyant look of all the black paint could order a Rallye Kadett without it, but very few Rallye Kadett buyers opted for the \u201cunderstated\u201d paintwork option.\n\n===Opel Olympia===\n{{main|Opel Olympia}}\n[[File:1968-Opel-Olympia.jpg|thumb|1968 Opel Olympia 2-door sedan, with the standard vinyl roof]]\n\nThe Olympia name was revived in 1967. This time it was only a luxury version of the contemporary [[Opel Kadett B]]. Interior finishings were of a higher order than in the Kadett. Engines were an 1100&nbsp;cc unit with {{convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} taken from the Kadett and two larger units, a 1700&nbsp;cc with {{convert|75|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 1900&nbsp;cc with {{convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} which were normally used in the [[Opel Rekord]].<ref name=WC68>{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1968 | editor-last = d'Angelo | editor-first = Sergio | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | page = 664 | year = 1968 }}</ref> The bodywork was of the \"fastback\" style, rather than of the more upright regular sedan-style bodywork used on most Kadetts. The Olympia was not highly successful and was replaced in 1970 by the all new [[Opel Ascona]].\n\n===Limited edition \"run-out\" specials===\nThe Kadett B was in production for 8 years, which represented a longer production run than was achieved by any other Kadett before or subsequently.   This freed up the manufacturer to focus new model development on the important [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models which appeared in 1970.   The Kadett B's strong marketplace performance was helped by the lukewarm reception German buyers gave to the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] which in its original incarnation German buyers perceived as cramped, crude and uncomfortable.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 396 & 397: \"Der grossere Teil der Produktion ging ins Ausland, weil der Ford Escort [Mk I] auf dem deutschen Markt wegen seiner pummeligen Form, seiner simplen Konstruktion, seiner holprigen Stra\u00dfenlage und seines bescheidenen Komforts nur m\u00e4\u00dfigen Zuspruch fand...   848 388 [Escort Mk Is fertigten] die deutschen Ford-Werke, doch nur 234 667 Exemplaren fanden deutsche K\u00e4ufer.\"</ref>   At the end of 1972, with rumours of a replacement appearing in the trade press, Opel nevertheless felt it necessary to prepare a series of special edition Opel Kadetts with a number of \"options\" included as standard features, but with little chance for customers to vary the specifications.   By building large batches of identically equipped cars the manufacturer was able to provide attractively low prices to customers prepared to forego the chance to specify their Kadett \"\u00e0 la carte\" from the colour, trim and options lists.   Forty years on, some of the options listed have become standard on cars of this class, while others have fallen completely out of favour.\n\nThe limited edition cars were built and sold for the 1973 model year, which was the Kadett B's run-out (or final) year.\n\n====Kadett Sport (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Sport came with matte black exterior decor reminiscent of the Kadett Rallye, but whereas the Kadett Rallye came with a coupe body the Kadett-Sport used only the two-door \"Limousine\" sedan/saloon body.   Also the recommended price was 1,171 Marks (12%) lower than for the similarly powered 1.2-litre {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} Kadett Rallye.\n\nThe Kadett-Sport buyer could specify any one of three eye-catching body colours: \"roof-tile red\", \"yellow ochre\" and \"lemon yellow\"  ''(Ziegelrot, Ocker und Citrusgelb)''.   Appropriate features included in the \"customer-friendly\" price were a sports exhaust/muffler, the rallye gauge cluster from the Rallye model, a sports steering wheel, servo assisted brakes with discs at the front, anti-roll bars, high-backed front seats, sports wheels and tires, a heated rear window, seat belts and, under the bonnet, an enhanced alternator to cope with the anticipated demands of additional electrical equipment.\n\n====Kadett Holiday (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Holiday came with a standard package of extras, chief among which were a steel sliding sun roof, sports wheels, large fog lights at the front ''and'' a rear fog light, and high-backed front seats incorporating stylish wrap-around head restraints.\n\n====Kadett Festival (1973)====\nThe most luxuriously equipped of the special edition Kadetts of 1973, the Festival could be purchased as a Limousine (sedan/saloon) or as a Coup\u00e9.   The cars were powered by the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.2S engine, and for approximately an extra 500 Marks the 3-speed automatic \"Strasbourg\" transmission could be specified.\n\nThe Kadett-Festival buyer could choose from three fashionably metallic body colours: \"sahara gold\", \"monza blue\" and \"lime green\".   \"Extras\" included as standard features in the \"friendly\" price were velour covered seats exclusive to the Kadett Festival, a sports steering wheel, front disc brakes packaged with servo-assistance for the brakes, anti-roll bars front and rear, a more powerful alternator than on most Kadetts, halogen spot lamps, a heated back window, sports wheels with radial tires and the external decoration of thin twin side-stripes.\n\n====Kadett Grand Prix (1973)====\nThe Kadett Grand Prix was a special edition Kadett using the two-door Limousine (sedan/saloon) body with its interior enhanced by the fitting of carpets, a sports steering wheel and 3-point mounted seatbelts.   Under the bonnet/hood, there was an uprated alternator.   The 3-speed automatic transmission could be ordered as an extra.\n\nFor most of the run-out specials, customers were restricted to a choice of three body colours, but Grand Prix buyers could choose from between roof-til red, yellow ochre, sierra beige and arctic white.\n\n===Export specials===\n\n====Opel Ascona (modified Kadett B assembled in Biel, [[Switzerland]])====\nThe Opel Ascona 1700 should not be confused with the all-new [[Opel Ascona]] introduced in 1970.   The \"Opel Ascona\" name was originally used for a 4-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon)-bodied edition of the Kadett B powered by the manufacturer's 1,698&nbsp;cc [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] high compression ratio \"1.7S\" engine.   The interior was extensively modified, and incorporated several elements from the Kadett's \"L\" equipment package.   Opel's first four Asconas came from the Kadett plant in [[Bochum]], but all the rest of the 2,560 Kadett-based cars were assembled at [[Biel]], near the Franco-German [[Languages of Switzerland|language frontier]] through central Switzerland, using imported components.   [[General Motors]] had originally established their small auto-assembly facility in Biel in the 1930s as a reaction to a surge in [[Mercantilism|trade protectionism]] which had been part of the political reaction in Europe and America to the [[Great Depression|economic depression]] of the early 1930s.\n\n====Mixed fortunes in the [[US]]====\nThe Kadett B was sold in the United States through a large number of selected [[Buick]] dealers from 1966 until Autumn 1972 ( 72 models were only imported by special order by the dealer ), branded simply as the '''Opel''' in the 1970 and 71 model years. The U.S. models from the 1968 model year were given the front end and trim similar to the new [[Opel Olympia]] with the turn signals put into the grille beside the headlights ( as opposed to under them like the Olympia ).   From 1969 additional lighting changes were made to include side marker lights ( The 1968 had side marker reflectors ) on the front fender and larger wrap-around tail lights that were unique to the US Market to meet new US regulations.   The US cars also received sealed-beam headlights at the front, and the car took part in the [[Trans-Am Series]] during its commercial life.   The Kadett Bs, like the predecessor Kadett A, were technically simple cars whose task was to compete with the market leader, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].   The mainstay of the US Kadett at this time was the coupe-bodied fast back and station wagon/caravan. Sedans and specifically the four-door sedan were offered only sporadically. In the case of the four door it was only offered in the 1967 ( All were 1.1L and trim matched the European Opel Kadett of the time ) and 1971 model years ( All were 1.9L and less than 700 were imported and sold ).\n\nRoughly 430,000 Opel Kadett Bs were imported to the U.S.\n\nThe [[United States]] car magazine ''[[Car and Driver]]'' published a highly critical test of an ''Opel Kadett L 1500 Caravan'' in February 1968, featuring photos of the car in a junkyard. Reportedly, GM withdrew ads from that magazine for several months as a consequence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kf0zqDyLgBkC&pg=PA191 |title=Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech |first=Richard L. |last=Abel |page=191 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nBetween 1965 and 1973 Opel produced 2,691,300 Kadett Bs<ref name=\"OldtimerKatalogNr23\"/> making this model one of the most successful Opels to date in terms of sales volume.   The Kadett benefitted on the domestic market from a progressive slowing of demand for the old [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], while the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Volkswagen Golf]] which would compete for sales more effectively against the Kadett C both got off to a relatively slow start respectively in 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe two-seat [[Opel GT]] was heavily based on Kadett B components, its body made by a French contractor, [[Brissonneau & Lotz]], at their [[Creil]] factory.\n\n{{gallery | width = 190 | height = 113\n|File:1967 Opel Kadett L Coup\u00e9 (US), rear right, Hershey 2019.jpg|US-market 1967 Opel Kadett B \"[[Gill|Gills-coup\u00e9]]\" (''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'')\n|File:Kadett 1700 Front.JPG|Opel Kadett B 4-door Limousine\n|File:Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 F front 20110811.jpg|Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 \"F\" (1967-73)\n|File:Opel Kadett B BW 2016-07-17 13-28-59.jpg|Opel Kadett B \"LS\" Fastback sedan/saloon (1967-70)\n|File:Kadett B Kombi rear 23072007.jpg|Rear-view of Opel Kadett B 3-door Caravan (Kombi) (1965-73)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, front right.jpg|US-market 1971 Opel Kadett 36D (4 Door)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, rear left.jpg|Rear view, showing the US-only tail lights used from 1969 until 1971 \n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Opel}}\n{{Classic Opel timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Opel vehicles|Kadett B]]\n[[Category:Compact cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.
