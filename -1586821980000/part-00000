Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nAfter the decision to build a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore, the construction of what would become the North South Line was given priority as the line passed through the [[Orchard Road]] corridor as well as the rest of the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], the latter of which faced a high demand for public transport. Also, it was near the more densely populated housing estates such as [[Toa Payoh]] and [[Ang Mo Kio]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Annual report / Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority, Republic of Singapore.|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore: Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}</ref> The first section of the MRT line (and also the MRT system itself) from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] opened on 7 November 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/public-transport/projects/north-south-line.html|title=NORTH-SOUTH LINE|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=1 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Toa Payoh MRT station first to be topped out |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19850806-1.2.11.3?ST=1&AT=filter&K=toa+payoh+mrt+station&KA=toa+payoh+mrt+station&DF=&DT=&Display=0&AO=false&NPT=&L=&CTA=&NID=&CT=ARTICLE&WC=&YR=1985&QT=toa,payoh,mrt,station&oref=article |work=Business Times |date=6 August 1985 |access-date=15 June 2017 |via=NewspaperSG }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=All aboard for the Subway Age|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19871108-1.2.2|publisher=The Straits Times|date=8 November 1987}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e926e24f-9c14-482b-b278-d582b535deb6|title=MRT system begins operations - Singapore History|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Nine more stations from [[Novena MRT station|Novena station]] to [[Outram Park MRT station|Outram Park station]] via [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place]] followed on 12 December that year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19871212-1.2.3|title=Shopping for Xmas the MRT way...|last=Rav|first=Dhaliwal|date=12 December 1987|work=Straits Times|access-date=19 September 2017|via=eResources}}</ref> The line was extended northward to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988 as part of phase 2B<ref>{{cite news|title=MRT Yishun opens, two-thirds of system now complete|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newpaper19881220-1.2.11.2?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=yishun+mrt+station&KA=Yishun+MRT+Stat&DF=01%2F10%2F1970&DT=02%2F10%2F1990&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article&QT=yishun,mrt,station&oref=article|publisher=The New Paper|date=20 December 1988|location=NewspaperSG|page=8|language=English}}</ref> and it began independent operations on 4 November 1989 as the North South line when the extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] was opened.<ref>{{cite news |title=New names for eight stations |publisher=Singapore Monitor |date=30 November 1982}}</ref>\n\n===Woodlands extension===\n[[File:Ns9woodlands.jpg|thumb|left|Woodlands MRT station]] \n{{Quote box\n |class = <!-- Advanced users only.

Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nAfter the decision to build a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore, the construction of what would become the North South Line was given priority as the line passed through the [[Orchard Road]] corridor as well as the rest of the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], the latter of which faced a high demand for public transport.
