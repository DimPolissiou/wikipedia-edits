The Swahili, a non-contemporary enthnonym, included both Zanj, non-believers, and the Umma, Islamic community. Since Arab and Persian identity is patrilineal, elite Swahili claimed, often fictionalized, prestigious Asian genealogy. Modern misconceptions of cultural fusion or Asian origins developed from the tendency of wealthy Swahili to claim Asian origins and the disproportionate 19th century importation of Omani elements to Zanzibari and Swahili society (standard Swahili is the Zanzibari dialect and thus includes far more Arabic loanwords than the other, older Swahili dialects.<ref name=\"Horton and Middleton\">{{cite book |last=Horton |first= |last2=Middleton |first2= |title=The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nProminent settlements of the Zanj coast included [[Malindi]], [[Gede, Kenya|Gedi]], and [[Mombasa]]. By the late medieval period, the area included at least 37 substantial Swahili trading towns, many of them quite wealthy. However, these communities never consolidated into a single political entity (the \"[[Zanj Empire]]\" being a late 19th-century fiction).\n\nWhile the urban ruling and commercial classes of these Swahili settlements included some Arab and Persian immigrants, the vast majority were African Muslims.

Harsh circumstances apparently provoked three rebellions in the late 7th and 9th centuries.

A. Shaban states that the Zanj Rebellion was not a slave rebellion but rather an Arab rebellion supported by East African immigrants in Iraq:\n\n<blockquote>It was not a slave revolt. It was a ''zanj'', i.e. a Negro, revolt. To equate Negro with slave is a reflection of nineteenth-century racial theories; it could only apply to the American South before the Civil War...On the contrary, some of the people who were working in the salt marshes were among the first to fight against the revolt. Of course there were a few runaway slaves who joined the rebels, but this still does not make it a slave revolt. The vast majority of the rebels were Arabs of the Persian Gulf supported by free East Africans who had made their homes in the region.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkqlp-lHllcC&pg=PA101#PPA101 \"Islamic History\" By M.

The Swahili, a non-contemporary enthnonym, included both Zanj, non-believers, and the Umma, Islamic community. Since Arab and Persian identity is patrilineal, elite Swahili claimed, often fictionalized, prestigious Asian genealogy. Modern misconceptions of cultural fusion or Asian origins developed from the tendency of wealthy Swahili to claim Asian origins and the disproportionate 19th century importation of Omani elements to Zanzibari and Swahili society (standard Swahili is the Zanzibari dialect and thus includes far more Arabic loanwords than the other, older Swahili dialects.<ref name=\"Horton and Middleton\">{{cite book |last=Horton |first= |last2=Middleton |first2= |title=The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nProminent settlements of the Zanj coast included [[Malindi]], [[Gede, Kenya|Gedi]], and [[Mombasa]].

However, these communities never consolidated into a single political entity (the \"[[Zanj Empire]]\" being a late 19th-century fiction).\n\nWhile the urban ruling and commercial classes of these Swahili settlements included some Arab and Persian immigrants, the vast majority were African Muslims.

It was a ''zanj'', i.e. a Negro, revolt. To equate Negro with slave is a reflection of nineteenth-century racial theories; it could only apply to the American South before the Civil War...On the contrary, some of the people who were working in the salt marshes were among the first to fight against the revolt. Of course there were a few runaway slaves who joined the rebels, but this still does not make it a slave revolt. The vast majority of the rebels were Arabs of the Persian Gulf supported by free East Africans who had made their homes in the region.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkqlp-lHllcC&pg=PA101#PPA101 \"Islamic History\" By M.
