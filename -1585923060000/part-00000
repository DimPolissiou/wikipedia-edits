Web. 12 Oct 2010.</ref>\n\nTrafficking in Thailand is not limited to Thai citizens; many migrants from other countries are trafficked into Thailand to work in the Thai sex industry. In recent years there have been numerous cases of Burmese, Cambodian, and Lao people trafficked into Thai brothels in northern provinces such as Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai; central and eastern provinces such as Trat, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Chonburi, and Chumphon; and, Songkhla, Narathiwat, and Pattani near the southern Malaysian border.  More than 80,000 people have been sold into the Thai sex industry since 1990.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> The majority of sex workers in Thailand are foreigners and more than 60% of females entering the country to work in the sex industry are under the age of 18.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> There are 75,000 prostituted children in Thailand. This includes both children trafficked into Thailand and local children.<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n== Suspected causes ==\nAcademics and experts alike are unable to agree on one specific cause for people entering the sex industry through trafficking. These multiple causes can be categorized as economic, familial responsibilities, and religious beliefs. Many suspect that people sell sex because they have been coerced, abandoned, kidnapped, or sold into virtual slavery to pay off parental debts.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\n=== Economic causes ===\nThe economy of Thailand is considered one of the driving forces of trafficking because many families are poor farmers, such as those in the north. Lisa Rende Taylor, an anthropologist who has conducted studies on sex trafficking in Thailand, found that commercial sex work is a lucrative industry based on the economic inequality and disparities between Thailand's rural areas and Bangkok, and between Thailand and wealthier Asian nations.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nChildren often try a variety of other jobs such as scavenging, working in sweatshops, or begging.<ref name=\"montgomery\">Montgomery, Heather. \"Buying Innocence: Child-Sex Tourists in Thailand.\" Third World Quarterly 29.5 (2008): 903-917. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 23 Sep 2010.</ref> These jobs, however, do not pay well enough to convince children to not go into the better paying jobs in the sex industry. [[Prostitution]] may represent a way for a girl to earn enough money to maintain and enhance her family's property and status in her home village.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/><ref name=\"bower\"/>\n\nEconomic strife does not only influence those native to Thailand, but to those who are trafficked into Thailand itself.  Victims of trafficking that come from other nations are \"easily deceived or lured because they face poverty, unemployment, broken families, and unstable governments\" in their countries of origin.<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Familial responsibility ===\nOther experts believe that poverty and lack of education are not the main causes behind the trafficking of Thai people, as is often assumed. Rende Taylor's research demonstrated how, among Thais, girls from both poor and better off families may become trafficked. In addition, education actually increased the risk of a rural girl being trafficked, due to the expectations and opportunity costs of that education. That is, girls who are allowed to study through 9th or even 12th grade, as compared with sisters who may not have been able to study as long, may have great expectations for their earning potential, likely in a larger town or city. These girls are especially at risk of being recruited and forced into sex trafficking, since, once in the city, they may not be able to get the job they envisioned, yet will be reluctant to return home penniless.  Many people involved in the sex industry may also feel an obligation to their family to repay for past sacrifices, with money being used as a way to improve the family's well-being and status.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nRende Taylor also found that when there is more than one daughter within the family, it is usually the middle or youngest child that ends up the sex industry, not the eldest, as is often assumed. The eldest daughter within a Thai family usually stays at home to assist her parents in maintaining the house, farm, and younger siblings. It is the middle-born daughters who are expected to financially assist the family. Youngest daughters usually receive more schooling than their elder sisters due to the earnings of older siblings; however, this may be a risk factor for youngest daughters getting recruited and/or forced into the sex industry as well.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/><ref name=\"bower\"/>\n\n=== Religious beliefs ===\nMore than 90% of Thailand's population is [[Buddhist]].<ref name=CIA>{{cite web|title=People and Society; Religion|website=The World Factbook; East & SE Asia; Thailand|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html|publisher=US Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2015-01-11}}</ref> Buddhist beliefs, especially in northern Thailand, contribute to community acceptance of prostitution and sex trafficking. Thai Buddhists hold that \"each person\u2019s soul inhabits many physical bodies over time, with the quality of each life influenced by the soul's store of merit\".<ref name=\"bower\"/> Merit can be earned by providing aid to one's parents, which can be through earnings from sex work, despite the nature of the work itself.<ref name=\"bower\"/> The merit gained would, in essence, bless the victims in their next life, negating the effects of having been involved in the sex industry. Nearly US$300 million is transferred yearly by trafficked persons engaged in prostitution back to their families in Thailand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Safety Nets for Women|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=978-9211201581|location=New York|pages=69}}</ref>\n\n== Sex industry in Thailand ==\nIn Thailand, close to 40,000 children under the age of 16 are believed to be in the sex trade, working in clubs, bars, and brothels.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> A survey in 1998 showed that 54.01% of these workers were in the north, 28.9% in the northeast, and 9.67% in the central region.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> Prostitution of trafficked and native peoples is a very lucrative business. \"Between 1993 and 1995 it is estimated that prostitution produced an annual income between 22.5 and 27 billion dollars alone.\"<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Methods used by traffickers ===\nCommon methods of trafficking include, but are not limited to, physical force, coercion such as debt relief for family, job, marriage, threats, and passport theft. Girls can also be kidnapped or lured into the industry by promises of high paying work as dancers, waitresses, domestic servants, or sale representatives.<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\nRecruitment is another method commonly used by traffickers. Girls are recruited at a young age into the sex industry, often by former prostitutes who are agents of a brothel or \"[[massage parlor]]\".<ref name=\"hughes\"/> These agents have a specific agenda. They scout poor villages and when a potential candidate is found, the agent offers a down payment for the girl to her parents.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> The agent returns when the girl is 12 to make the final payment and to pick up the \"goods\".<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Appeal of young women and children ===\nOne reason that young women and girls may be disproportionately recruited into prostitution is the demand of the clientele of the sex industry. Advertised promises of youth, virginity, and innocence have led to increased demands for children in the global sex trade.<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> Research has found that the characteristics that men find attractive in Thai women are \"simplicity, loyalty, affection, and innocence.\"<ref name=\"montgomery\"/>\n\nThere are two types of men who use trafficked children. The first type is [[pedophilia|preferential abusers]] who actively seek out sex with children of a particular age.<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> The second type is situational abusers who might have sex with children if an offer is made. Their sexual preference is not necessarily for children. These men are commonly [[sex tourists]], or those who travel to other countries specifically looking for sex.\n\nThe increasing number of people with [[AIDS]] is another reason for the increasing recruitment of young girls. The sex industry uses AIDS as an excuse \"under the false pretense that younger girls will not be infected with the disease\".<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Sex Trafficking of Men and Boys in Thailand ===\nMen and boys are trafficked for sex in Thailand as well as women and girls. While largely denied victim status by the Thai government and global anti-trafficking movement more broadly, they are exploited in similar ways to female victims, yet face specific sets of vulnerabilities. Central factors that contribute to a male's vulnerability to being trafficked for sex in Thailand include national and ethnic background, citizenship status, substance abuse, family financial status, employment history (specifically in the sex industry), and local law enforcement practices. A large number of male sex workers in Chiang Mai are migrants from Myanmar or neighboring hill tribes in the North of Thailand, and because the government will not grant them citizenship, are forced to pursue employment in the informal labor sector, where they become highly vulnerable to both sex and labor trafficking. \n\nMen and boys who are involved in the sex industry in Thailand generally work in massage parlors, show/KTV bars, or as '\"freelancers\" in a variety of establishments, and a 2017 study on the prevalence of men working in Chiang Mai's sex trade found 80% of respondents to be between the ages of 15\u201324. <ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Jarrett D|last2=Glotfelty|first2=Elliot|last3=Miles|first3=Glenn|title=\"No Other Choice\": A Baseline Study on the Vulnerabilities of Males in the Sex Trade in Chiang Mai, Thailand|journal=Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence|volume=2|issue=4}}</ref> Studies have shown strong correlations between ethnic background and the area of the sex industry in which a given male works or is trafficked-- in Chiang Mai, for example, the majority of Burmese migrant men working in the commercial sex trade operate out of bars and nightclubs, while those from Thailand's hill tribes and other parts of the rural North tend to staff the city's massage parlors. Many men and boys from these ethnic minority groups are drawn into the exploitative sex trade due to the low wages and discrimination found in other, more formal sectors of the economy (such as construction or factory work). <ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nFew legal or social services are available to the men and boys involved in Thailand's sex industry, and they are subject to complex social stigmatization surrounding denial of male victimhood along with discrimination against migrant/stateless status, ethnic background, language spoken, literacy/education level, and sexuality. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Recognition of Males in the Global Fight Against Trafficking ====\nThe lack of conversation, advocacy, legal/social support services, and academic work around the sexual exploitation of males can be traced to larger social discourses surrounding male sexuality, dominance, and behavior. Media representations of masculinity and sexual dominance contribute to the idea that men cannot be victims, especially in regards to sex-related crimes. The lack of public knowledge and attention to male victimhood and vulnerability is strongly reflected in the quality of services and strength of legal frameworks available to male victims of sex trafficking .<ref name=\":4\">Jones, Samuel Vincent (2010). The Invisible Man: The Conscious Neglect of Men and Boys in the War on Human Trafficking, Utah Law Review, No 4.</ref> Experts describe the \"perceived agency and resilience in young males\" to be a strong force in deterring male victims from seeking the support they need, and discouraging male-inclusive anti-trafficking support networks from forming in the first place. <ref name=\":0\"/> Within the spare social support frameworks for male victims that do exist, the specific vulnerabilities of different populations-- regarding nationality and migration status, sexual orientation, drug use, socio-economic status, and health status-- are often unaddressed, leaving crucial groups' needs unmet. The double stigma that surrounds male victims of sex trafficking, involving homosexuality and sex work more broadly-- makes it incredibly difficult for male victims to come forward and seek help, or even to self-organize. Male victims are often legal targets for arrests for prostitution, and face higher rates of police violence and brutality than female victims in regards to contact with law enforcement. <ref name=\":1\">Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP) (2014). The Needs and Rights of Male Sex Workers, Briefing paper no 8, UK</ref>\n=== Risks for Trafficked Individuals ===\nHIV/AIDS, STDs, and pregnancy are major risks for those involved in the sex industry. Most victims are likely to be under control of their owners after being trafficked into a new country.

Web. 12 Oct 2010.</ref>\n\nTrafficking in Thailand is not limited to Thai citizens; many migrants from other countries are trafficked into Thailand to work in the Thai sex industry. In recent years there have been numerous cases of Burmese, Cambodian, and Lao people trafficked into Thai brothels in northern provinces such as Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai; central and eastern provinces such as Trat, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Chonburi, and Chumphon; and, Songkhla, Narathiwat, and Pattani near the southern Malaysian border.  More than 80,000 people have been sold into the Thai sex industry since 1990.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> The majority of sex workers in Thailand are foreigners and more than 60% of females entering the country to work in the sex industry are under the age of 18.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> There are 75,000 prostituted children in Thailand. This includes both children trafficked into Thailand and local children.<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n== Suspected causes ==\nAcademics and experts alike are unable to agree on one specific cause for people entering the sex industry through trafficking. These multiple causes can be categorized as economic, familial responsibilities, and religious beliefs. Many suspect that people sell sex because they have been coerced, abandoned, kidnapped, or sold into virtual slavery to pay off parental debts.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\n=== Economic causes ===\nThe economy of Thailand is considered one of the driving forces of trafficking because many families are poor farmers, such as those in the north. Lisa Rende Taylor, an anthropologist who has conducted studies on sex trafficking in Thailand, found that commercial sex work is a lucrative industry based on the economic inequality and disparities between Thailand's rural areas and Bangkok, and between Thailand and wealthier Asian nations.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nChildren often try a variety of other jobs such as scavenging, working in sweatshops, or begging.<ref name=\"montgomery\">Montgomery, Heather. \"Buying Innocence: Child-Sex Tourists in Thailand.\" Third World Quarterly 29.5 (2008): 903-917. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 23 Sep 2010.</ref> These jobs, however, do not pay well enough to convince children to not go into the better paying jobs in the sex industry. [[Prostitution]] may represent a way for a girl to earn enough money to maintain and enhance her family's property and status in her home village.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/><ref name=\"bower\"/>\n\nEconomic strife does not only influence those native to Thailand, but to those who are trafficked into Thailand itself.  Victims of trafficking that come from other nations are \"easily deceived or lured because they face poverty, unemployment, broken families, and unstable governments\" in their countries of origin.<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Familial responsibility ===\nOther experts believe that poverty and lack of education are not the main causes behind the trafficking of Thai people, as is often assumed. Rende Taylor's research demonstrated how, among Thais, girls from both poor and better off families may become trafficked. In addition, education actually increased the risk of a rural girl being trafficked, due to the expectations and opportunity costs of that education. That is, girls who are allowed to study through 9th or even 12th grade, as compared with sisters who may not have been able to study as long, may have great expectations for their earning potential, likely in a larger town or city. These girls are especially at risk of being recruited and forced into sex trafficking, since, once in the city, they may not be able to get the job they envisioned, yet will be reluctant to return home penniless.  Many people involved in the sex industry may also feel an obligation to their family to repay for past sacrifices, with money being used as a way to improve the family's well-being and status.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nRende Taylor also found that when there is more than one daughter within the family, it is usually the middle or youngest child that ends up the sex industry, not the eldest, as is often assumed. The eldest daughter within a Thai family usually stays at home to assist her parents in maintaining the house, farm, and younger siblings. It is the middle-born daughters who are expected to financially assist the family. Youngest daughters usually receive more schooling than their elder sisters due to the earnings of older siblings; however, this may be a risk factor for youngest daughters getting recruited and/or forced into the sex industry as well.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/><ref name=\"bower\"/>\n\n=== Religious beliefs ===\nMore than 90% of Thailand's population is [[Buddhist]].<ref name=CIA>{{cite web|title=People and Society; Religion|website=The World Factbook; East & SE Asia; Thailand|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html|publisher=US Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2015-01-11}}</ref> Buddhist beliefs, especially in northern Thailand, contribute to community acceptance of prostitution and sex trafficking. Thai Buddhists hold that \"each person\u2019s soul inhabits many physical bodies over time, with the quality of each life influenced by the soul's store of merit\".<ref name=\"bower\"/> Merit can be earned by providing aid to one's parents, which can be through earnings from sex work, despite the nature of the work itself.<ref name=\"bower\"/> The merit gained would, in essence, bless the victims in their next life, negating the effects of having been involved in the sex industry. Nearly US$300 million is transferred yearly by trafficked persons engaged in prostitution back to their families in Thailand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Safety Nets for Women|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=978-9211201581|location=New York|pages=69}}</ref>\n\n== Sex industry in Thailand ==\nIn Thailand, close to 40,000 children under the age of 16 are believed to be in the sex trade, working in clubs, bars, and brothels.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> A survey in 1998 showed that 54.01% of these workers were in the north, 28.9% in the northeast, and 9.67% in the central region.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> Prostitution of trafficked and native peoples is a very lucrative business. \"Between 1993 and 1995 it is estimated that prostitution produced an annual income between 22.5 and 27 billion dollars alone.\"<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Methods used by traffickers ===\nCommon methods of trafficking include, but are not limited to, physical force, coercion such as debt relief for family, job, marriage, threats, and passport theft. Girls can also be kidnapped or lured into the industry by promises of high paying work as dancers, waitresses, domestic servants, or sale representatives.<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\nRecruitment is another method commonly used by traffickers. Girls are recruited at a young age into the sex industry, often by former prostitutes who are agents of a brothel or \"[[massage parlor]]\".<ref name=\"hughes\"/> These agents have a specific agenda. They scout poor villages and when a potential candidate is found, the agent offers a down payment for the girl to her parents.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> The agent returns when the girl is 12 to make the final payment and to pick up the \"goods\".<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Appeal of young women and children ===\nOne reason that young women and girls may be disproportionately recruited into prostitution is the demand of the clientele of the sex industry. Advertised promises of youth, virginity, and innocence have led to increased demands for children in the global sex trade.<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> Research has found that the characteristics that men find attractive in Thai women are \"simplicity, loyalty, affection, and innocence.\"<ref name=\"montgomery\"/>\n\nThere are two types of men who use trafficked children. The first type is [[pedophilia|preferential abusers]] who actively seek out sex with children of a particular age.<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> The second type is situational abusers who might have sex with children if an offer is made. Their sexual preference is not necessarily for children. These men are commonly [[sex tourists]], or those who travel to other countries specifically looking for sex.\n\nThe increasing number of people with [[AIDS]] is another reason for the increasing recruitment of young girls. The sex industry uses AIDS as an excuse \"under the false pretense that younger girls will not be infected with the disease\".<ref name=\"hughes\"/>\n\n=== Sex Trafficking of Men and Boys in Thailand ===\nMen and boys are trafficked for sex in Thailand as well as women and girls. While largely denied victim status by the Thai government and global anti-trafficking movement more broadly, they are exploited in similar ways to female victims, yet face specific sets of vulnerabilities. Central factors that contribute to a male's vulnerability to being trafficked for sex in Thailand include national and ethnic background, citizenship status, substance abuse, family financial status, employment history (specifically in the sex industry), and local law enforcement practices. A large number of male sex workers in Chiang Mai are migrants from Myanmar or neighboring hill tribes in the North of Thailand, and because the government will not grant them citizenship, are forced to pursue employment in the informal labor sector, where they become highly vulnerable to both sex and labor trafficking. \n\nMen and boys who are involved in the sex industry in Thailand generally work in massage parlors, show/KTV bars, or as '\"freelancers\" in a variety of establishments, and a 2017 study on the prevalence of men working in Chiang Mai's sex trade found 80% of respondents to be between the ages of 15\u201324. <ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Jarrett D|last2=Glotfelty|first2=Elliot|last3=Miles|first3=Glenn|title=\"No Other Choice\": A Baseline Study on the Vulnerabilities of Males in the Sex Trade in Chiang Mai, Thailand|journal=Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence|volume=2|issue=4}}</ref> Studies have shown strong correlations between ethnic background and the area of the sex industry in which a given male works or is trafficked-- in Chiang Mai, for example, the majority of Burmese migrant men working in the commercial sex trade operate out of bars and nightclubs, while those from Thailand's hill tribes and other parts of the rural North tend to staff the city's massage parlors. Many men and boys from these ethnic minority groups are drawn into the exploitative sex trade due to the low wages and discrimination found in other, more formal sectors of the economy (such as construction or factory work). <ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nFew legal or social services are available to the men and boys involved in Thailand's sex industry, and they are subject to complex social stigmatization surrounding denial of male victimhood along with discrimination against migrant/stateless status, ethnic background, language spoken, literacy/education level, and sexuality. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Recognition of Males in the Global Fight Against Trafficking ====\nThe lack of conversation, advocacy, legal/social support services, and academic work around the sexual exploitation of males can be traced to larger social discourses surrounding male sexuality, dominance, and behavior. Media representations of masculinity and sexual dominance contribute to the idea that men cannot be victims, especially in regards to sex-related crimes. The lack of public knowledge and attention to male victimhood and vulnerability is strongly reflected in the quality of services and strength of legal frameworks available to male victims of sex trafficking .<ref name=\":4\">Jones, Samuel Vincent (2010). The Invisible Man: The Conscious Neglect of Men and Boys in the War on Human Trafficking, Utah Law Review, No 4.</ref> Experts describe the \"perceived agency and resilience in young males\" to be a strong force in deterring male victims from seeking the support they need, and discouraging male-inclusive anti-trafficking support networks from forming in the first place. <ref name=\":0\"/> Within the spare social support frameworks for male victims that do exist, the specific vulnerabilities of different populations-- regarding nationality and migration status, sexual orientation, drug use, socio-economic status, and health status-- are often unaddressed, leaving crucial groups' needs unmet. The double stigma that surrounds male victims of sex trafficking, involving homosexuality and sex work more broadly-- makes it incredibly difficult for male victims to come forward and seek help, or even to self-organize. Male victims are often legal targets for arrests for prostitution, and face higher rates of police violence and brutality than female victims in regards to contact with law enforcement. <ref name=\":1\">Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP) (2014).

It is a [[Geography of Nepal|Hill]] district. Baitadi, with [[Dasharathchand]] as its headquarters, covers an area of {{cvt|1,519|km2}} and has a population of  250,898 according to the census (2011).<ref name=\"National Population and Housing Census 2011(National Report)\" />  The Baitadi district entails 56 village development councils (VDCs) and two municipality. Baitadi falls into the farthest western regional district of Nepal touching Jhulaghat, India, Nepal's neighboring country, to its border.\n\n==History==\n[[Baitadi]]  was once a part of the Great [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuri's]] Kingdom.  After the fall of that Kingdom, around the 10th century,  Khas King Ashok Challa of ''Sapadalaksh'' (Karnali Zone or Dullu, [[Dailekh]]) seized most of that part of the [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuri's]] Kingdom, including Baitadi. There were three major centres of Khas King i.e., (1)   '''Bairath (Baitadi)''' (2)  '''Kamadesh (kali kumaun)''' and (3)  '''Kedarbhumi (Garhwal)''' to rule in a Central Himalaya .<ref>'''A New History of Uttarakhand''' ''page 62''</ref> According to the historical folk-tales in Baitadi it was one of the [[Chand Kings]] who fought with the Khas king and established a sovereign state for the [[Chand Kings|Chand]] dynasty in [[Baitadi]].<ref>'''History of Doti Kingdom''' ''page 212''</ref> These tales resembled a historical story of the establishment of Kumaun Kingdom. One of the view of the historians of [[Uttarakhand]], a state in India, Nepal's neighboring country,  suggest that it was Thohar Chand who was responsible for establishing the Chand dynasty in Kali-Kumaun.  He then changed his name to Abhai Chand after he became a King. Badri Dutt Pandey written history of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaun]] book has quoted the following story about the history of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaun]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n''\"Kanaknidhi Tiwari, Son of Jay Dev Tiwari and Pandit Harivallabh Pandey, as told to Mr. Hamilton at [[Farrukhabad]] in 1818 A.D, that Thohar Chand, on arriving from [[Jhusi]],  served in the palace of some Magar or Jar (Jat ?) King of Nepal. Jaya Dev was also with him. That state was under the Karvirpur Kingdom. Thohar Chand and Jay Dev, with the help of some people of the plain, destroyed that kingdom and established the Champawati and Kurmanchal Kingdoms, which later became famous as Kumaoun. He did not tell the date but only told that it was about 350 years before.\"''{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nGyan Chand (1376 A.D)  was the first ruler of the Chand  Dynasty of [[Champawat]] who was part of the third generation from Thohar Chand or Abhai Chand.<ref>Chand Kings of '''Champawat''' : '''''Dr. Madan Chandra Bhatt'''''</ref> Gyan Chand's grandfather, Trilok Chand, and his father, Kalyan Chand, were rulers of Baitadi, according to the folk tales.<ref>'''History of Doti Kingdom''' : '''''Bhoj Raj Bhattarai'''''</ref>\n\n'''Rulers:'''\n\nThe Name of the Kings who ruled in Baitadi were:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n*Thohar- Ahai Chand (1261\u20131281 AD)\n*Trilok Chand\n*Kalyan Chand\n*Gyan Chand (1376 AD)\n*Karm Chand\n*Bharati Chand\n*Ratan Chand\n*Megh Chand (1503 AD)\n*Kirti Chand\n*Kalyan Chand\n*Rudra Chand (1580 AD)\n{{col-break}}\n*Laxman Chand\n*Dilip Chand\n*Vijay Chand\n*Trimal Chand\n*Baj Bhadur Chand\n*Udyot Chand\n*Gyan Chand- II (1706 AD)\n*Jagat Chand\n*Debi Chand\n*Kalyan Chand- II (1731AD)\n*Deep Chand\n{{col-end}}\n\nBaitadi was a part of [[Doti|Doti Kingdom]] during the medieval era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.volunteersummernepal.org/tag/deuki-pratha |title=Deuki Pratha |date=15 January 2012 |website= |publisher= |access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> Nepal annexed Doti in 1790<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epopee.huma-num.fr/epic_documents_MG_Bharats.htm |title=M.

Baitadi falls into the farthest western regional district of Nepal touching Jhulaghat, India, Nepal's neighboring country, to its border.\n\n==History==\n[[Baitadi]]  was once a part of the Great [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuri's]] Kingdom.  After the fall of that Kingdom, around the 10th century,  Khas King Ashok Challa of ''Sapadalaksh'' (Karnali Zone or Dullu, [[Dailekh]]) seized most of that part of the [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuri's]] Kingdom, including Baitadi. There were three major centres of Khas King i.e., (1)   '''Bairath (Baitadi)''' (2)  '''Kamadesh (kali kumaun)''' and (3)  '''Kedarbhumi (Garhwal)''' to rule in a Central Himalaya .<ref>'''A New History of Uttarakhand''' ''page 62''</ref> According to the historical folk-tales in Baitadi it was one of the [[Chand Kings]] who fought with the Khas king and established a sovereign state for the [[Chand Kings|Chand]] dynasty in [[Baitadi]].<ref>'''History of Doti Kingdom''' ''page 212''</ref> These tales resembled a historical story of the establishment of Kumaun Kingdom. One of the view of the historians of [[Uttarakhand]], a state in India, Nepal's neighboring country,  suggest that it was Thohar Chand who was responsible for establishing the Chand dynasty in Kali-Kumaun.  He then changed his name to Abhai Chand after he became a King. Badri Dutt Pandey written history of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaun]] book has quoted the following story about the history of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaun]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n''\"Kanaknidhi Tiwari, Son of Jay Dev Tiwari and Pandit Harivallabh Pandey, as told to Mr. Hamilton at [[Farrukhabad]] in 1818 A.D, that Thohar Chand, on arriving from [[Jhusi]],  served in the palace of some Magar or Jar (Jat ?) King of Nepal. Jaya Dev was also with him. That state was under the Karvirpur Kingdom. Thohar Chand and Jay Dev, with the help of some people of the plain, destroyed that kingdom and established the Champawati and Kurmanchal Kingdoms, which later became  famous as Kumaoun.
