Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]].

This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for single-celled organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] as well as the specialized cells in [[Multicellular organism|multicellular organisms]] such as [[human]]s.  Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.\n\n[[Anatomy]] considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as [[organ (biology)|organs]] and organ systems.<ref>{{cite book |author=Henry Gray |title=Anatomy of the Human Body |year=1918 |publisher=Lea & Febiger|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html |isbn= }}</ref> It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently.

The theme of \"structure to function\" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Physiology studies how for example [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact.\n\n===Evolutionary===\nEvolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[herpetology]], or [[entomology]], but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.\n\nEvolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,<ref name=Jablonski>{{cite journal |author=Jablonski D |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114\u20132116 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |ref=harv |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe761f71c762f11618771d8c2593f9819b1472c0 }}</ref> and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]]<ref>{{cite book |author=John H.

Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|zoological systematics]].\n\n[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|left|Linnaeus's table of the animal kingdom from the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).]]\nMany scientists now consider the [[five-kingdom system]] outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s)<ref name=\"domain\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576\u20134579 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}</ref>  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.<ref name=\"domain\"/>\n\nFurther, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:\n[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]; [[phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|class]]; [[Order (biology)|order]]; [[Family (biology)|family]]; [[genus]]; [[species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&lpg=PA198&dq=species%20epithet%20capitalize&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q=species%20epithet%20capitalize | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]].

Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so.

Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s)<ref name=\"domain\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576\u20134579 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}</ref>  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.<ref name=\"domain\"/>\n\nFurther, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:\n[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]; [[phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|class]]; [[Order (biology)|order]]; [[Family (biology)|family]]; [[genus]]; [[species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase.

In 1924, Congress created the NCPPC to create a park and playground system for the National Capital and by 1926, they had begun making plans for a \"parkway\" or park system that would include land along the Anacostia, at Fort Dupont, along Foundry Branch and along Oxon Run.<ref>{{cite news |title=Planner to seek aid for parkway |work=The Washington Post |date=29 April 1927}}</ref> By 1930, NCPPC had begun purchasing narrow strips of land along the shores of the stream for the park. This coincided with a report from NCPPC identifying Oxon Run as a possible water source for Maryland.

He satirized bureaucracy and \"exposed economic inequities in stories that effectively combine [[wikt:local color|local color]] and universal truths\". Aziz Nesin has been presented with numerous awards in Turkey, Italy, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union. His works have been translated into over thirty languages.

Aziz Nesin donated to the Nesin Foundation his copyrights in their entirety for all his works in Turkey or other countries, including all of his published books, all plays to be staged, all copyrights for films, and all his works performed or used in radio or television.\n\nAziz Nesin was a political activist.

He satirized bureaucracy and \"exposed economic inequities in stories that effectively combine [[wikt:local color|local color]] and universal truths\". Aziz Nesin has been presented with numerous awards in Turkey, Italy, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union. His works have been translated into over thirty languages. During latter parts of his life he was said to be the only Turkish author who made a living only out of his earnings from his books.\n\nOn 6 June 1956, he married a coworker from the ''[[Akbaba (periodical)|Akbaba]]'' magazine, Meral \u00c7elen.\n\nIn 1972, he founded the Nesin Foundation. The purpose of the Nesin Foundation is to take, each year, four poor and destitute children into the Foundation's home and provide every necessity - shelter, education and training, starting from elementary school - until they complete high school, a trade school, or until they acquire a vocation. Aziz Nesin donated to the Nesin Foundation his copyrights in their entirety for all his works in Turkey or other countries, including all of his published books, all plays to be staged, all copyrights for films, and all his works performed or used in radio or television.\n\nAziz Nesin was a political activist. After the [[Turkish military coup, 1980|1980 military coup]] led by [[Kenan Evren]], the intelligentsia was oppressed. Aziz Nesin led a number of intellectuals to rebel against the military government, by issuing the Petition of Intellectuals ({{lang-tr|Ayd\u0131nlar Dilek\u00e7esi}}). He was the President of the [[T\u00fcrkiye Yazarlar Sendikas\u0131]] (Turkish Writers' Union){{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.\n\nHe was also a critic on [[Islam]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/07/obituaries/aziz-nesin-of-turkey-dies-at-80-writer-escaped-militants-arson.html|title=Aziz Nesin of Turkey Dies at 80; Writer Escaped Militants' Arson|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=1995-07-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-31|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In the early 1990s, he began a translation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s controversial novel, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.

To replace the contents of any line, the line number is entered and any text entered replaces the original.  While editing a line pressing Ctrl-C cancels any changes. The * marker remains on that line.\n\nEntering I (optionally preceded with a line number) inserts one or more lines before the * line or the line given.  When finished entering lines, Ctrl-C returns to the edlin command prompt.\n\n *6I\n        6:*(...or similar)\n        7:*^C \n &nbsp;\n *7D\n *L\n        1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.\n        2:\n        3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages\n        4: branded with a logo at the bottom:\n        5: \"This page created in edlin.\"\n        6: (...or similar)\n *\n\n:'''D''' - deletes the specified line, again optionally starting with the number of a line, or a range of lines.  E.g.: <code>2,4d</code> deletes lines 2 through 4.  In the above example, line 7 was deleted.  \n\n:'''R''' - is used to replace all occurrences of a piece of text in a given range of lines, for example, to replace a spelling error.  Including the ? prompts for each change.  E.g.: To replace 'prit' with 'print' and to prompt for each change: <code>?rprit^Zprint</code> (the ^Z represents pressing CTRL-Z).  It is case-sensitive.\n\n:'''S''' - searches for given text.  It is used in the same way as replace, but without the replacement text.  A search for 'apple' in the first 20 lines of a file is typed <code>1,20?sapple</code> (no space, unless that is part of the search) followed by a press of enter.  For each match, it asks if it is the correct one, and accepts n or y (or Enter).\n\n:'''P''' - displays a listing of a range of lines. If no range is specified, P displays the complete file from the * to the end.
