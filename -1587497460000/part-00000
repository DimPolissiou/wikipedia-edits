{"title_page": "Server Name Indication", "text_new": "{{short description|TLS extension for serve multiple HTTPS sites at the same IP address with different certificates}}\n{{Use American  English|date=January 2019}}\n'''Server Name Indication''' ('''SNI''') is an extension to the [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) computer [[networking protocol]] by which a [[Client (computing)|client]] indicates which [[hostname]] it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process.<ref name=\"rfc3546\">{{Cite IETF|title=Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions|rfc=3546|sectionname=Server Name Indication|section=3.1|page=8|last1=Blake-Wilson|first1=Simon|last2=Nystrom|first2=Magnus|last3=Hopwood|first3=David|last4=Mikkelsen|first4=Jan|last5=Wright|first5=Tim|date=June 2003|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}</ref> This allows a server to present multiple [[public key certificate|certificates]] on the same [[IP address]] and [[TCP port]] number and hence allows multiple secure ([[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]]) websites (or any other [[Server (computing)#Types of servers|service]] over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based [[virtual hosting]], but for HTTPS. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested.\n\n==Background of the problem==\n\nWhen making a TLS connection, the client requests a [[digital certificate]] from the web server. Once the server sends the certificate, the client examines it and compares the name it was trying to connect to with the name(s) included in the certificate. If a match occurs, the connection proceeds as normal. If a match is not found, the user may be warned of the discrepancy and the connection may abort as the mismatch may indicate an attempted [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. However, some applications allow the user to bypass the warning to proceed with the connection, with the user taking on the responsibility of trusting the certificate and, by extension, the connection. \n\nHowever it may be difficult \u2014 or even impossible, due to lack of a full list of all names in advance \u2014 to obtain a single certificate that covers all names a server will be responsible for. A server that is responsible for multiple hostnames is likely to need to present a different certificate for each name (or small group of names). Since 2005, CAcert has run experiments on different methods of using TLS on virtual servers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/VhostTaskForce |title=CAcert VHostTaskForce |work=CAcert Wiki |access-date=27 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822082355/http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/VhostTaskForce |archive-date=22 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Most of the experiments are unsatisfactory and impractical.  For example, it is possible to use ''subjectAltName'' to contain multiple domains controlled by one person<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/3908/what-is-a-multiple-domain-ucc-ssl-certificate?locale=en |title=What is a Multiple Domain (UCC) SSL Certificate? |publisher=[[GoDaddy]] }}</ref> in a single certificate.  Such \"unified communications certificates\" must be reissued every time the list of domains changes.\n\n[[Virtual hosting#Name-based|Name-based virtual hosting]] allows multiple DNS hostnames to be hosted by a single server (usually a web server) on the same IP address. To achieve this, the server uses a hostname presented by the client as part of the protocol (for HTTP the name is presented in the [[list of HTTP header fields#Requests|host header]]). However, when using HTTPS, the TLS handshake happens before the server sees any HTTP headers. Therefore, it is not possible for the server to use the information in the HTTP host header to decide which certificate to present and as such only names covered by the same certificate can be served from the same IP address.\n\nIn practice, this means that an HTTPS server can only serve one domain (or small group of domains) per IP address for secured and efficient browsing. Assigning a separate IP address for each site increases the cost of hosting, since requests for IP addresses must be justified to the [[regional Internet registry]] and [[IPv4 address exhaustion|IPv4 addresses are now exhausted]]. The result is that many websites are effectively constrained from using secure communications over IPv4. [[IPv6]] address space is not exhausted, so websites served using IPv6 are unaffected by this issue.\n\n== How SNI fixes the problem ==\nSNI addresses this issue by having the client send the name of the virtual domain as part of the TLS negotiation's '''ClientHello''' message.<ref name=\"Paul's Journal\">{{cite web\n | url = http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2005/04/24/tls-server-name-indication/\n | work = Paul's Journal\n | title = TLS Server Name Indication\n}}</ref> This enables the server to select the correct virtual domain early and present the browser with the certificate containing the correct name. Therefore, with clients and servers that implement SNI, a server with a single IP address can serve a group of domain names for which it is impractical to get a common certificate.\n\nSNI was added to the [[IETF]]'s [[Request for Comments|Internet RFCs]] in June 2003 through RFC 3546, ''Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions''. The latest version of the standard is RFC 6066.\n\n== Security implications (ESNI) ==\n\nThe desired hostname is not encrypted, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested.

It operates services to destinations in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Air Malta Boeing 720B AP-AMG LHR 1978-8-24.png|thumb|Air Malta leased its first Boeing 720B's in 1974 and they were joined by another three a few years later.]]\n[[File:Boeing 737-2Y5-Adv, Air Malta AN1170418.jpg|thumb|right|Once a mainstay of the fleet, the Boeing 737-200 series has since been phased out, seen here at London Heathrow Airport in 1983.]]\n\n===Early years===\nShortly after the Second World War, several small private airlines were formed in Malta. Amongst these were The Malta Instone Airline, BAS (Malta) Ltd, and Malta Airlines. In 1947 the former two companies merged to form Air Malta Ltd in fierce competition with the latter. Eventually in 1951 Malta Airlines absorbed the operations of Air Malta Ltd and continued operating through an agreement with [[British European Airways|BEA]] until 1973. The owners of Air Malta Ltd used their real estate, staff, and equipment to set up a [[ground handling]] company called MAS, Malta Aviation Services.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Maltese government appointed Albert Mizzi as chairman of the airline and made a call for an international airline partner to help set up an airline. [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA), then regarded as Asia's best airline, was selected and a new carrier set up. The name chosen for the new airline was similar to that of its forerunner, Air Malta Co Ltd, and was established on 31 March 1973.  BEA was chartered to continue its Malta operations, this time for Air Malta, until Air Malta's first flight on 1 April 1974. Both Malta Airlines and Malta Aviation Services were taken over by the government and the private owners were given a shareholding in Air Malta Co. Ltd.\n\nAir Malta started operations, with 2 [[wet leased]] [[Boeing 720B]]s that served Rome, [[Tripoli]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Paris]] from Malta. It later bought 3 more Boeing 720Bs and bought the original two.\n\nIn 1981, 3 [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]]s were wet leased, which were so successful that in 1983, 3 new fully owned Boeing 737-200s were delivered. In 1986, Air Malta bought 3 new Boeing 737-200s, and in 1987 ordered its first [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]. In 1989, Air Malta exercised an option for one more A320, and in 1992, 3 more [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]s were ordered and 4 [[Avro RJ70]]s were ordered for routes to [[Catania]] and [[Palermo]], and to new destinations such as [[Tunis]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].\n\nAfter the opening of [[Malta International Airport]] in 1992, Air Malta created ''CargoSystems'', which includes the transportation of cargo on Air Malta planes. In 1994, Air Malta inaugurated a cargo center at the airport. It was also during this time that a codesharing agreement with [[Trans World Airlines]] began.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n[[File:air.malta.a320-200.9h-aep.arp.jpg|thumb|An Air Malta [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]] wearing the former livery in 2007]]\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Air Malta embarked upon a fleet replacement programme, opting to change all aircraft to Airbus A319s and A320s. The last aircraft in this order, an A320, was delivered on 22 March 2007, and the fleet has not been replaced since.\n\nAir Malta had around 190 interline ticketing agreements with other [[IATA]] airlines. According to the [[Association of European Airlines]] quarterly review of May 2006, Air Malta is the airline that lost the least amount of passenger baggage. The amount of baggage lost in the first quarter of 2006 was 4.1 bags missing per 1000 passengers.\n\nIn winter, the airline often leases out aircraft to maximise earnings during the low season. In September 2007, for instance, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based [[Etihad Airways]] by which Air Malta wet-leased 2 Airbus aircraft to Etihad Airways for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft leased by Etihad Airways. In January and February 2009 Air Malta wet-leased an A320 to [[Sky Airline]] of Chile. From 2011 to 2014 Air Malta wet-leased another A320 to [[Sky Airline]].\n\nIn 2012 Air Malta underwent a re-branding process, which caused some controversy as the titles on aircraft and signage only say Malta, omitting the word ''Air''. The airline insisted this was not a name change, and the full name of the airline remains Air Malta. Additionally, the titles on the engines still say ''airmalta.com''. The first plane to show off the new colours was the Airbus A320-200 ''9H-AEN'' at the Malta International Airshow 2012. On the second and last day of the show the A320 and a Spitfire performed a flypast as the closing act.\n\nAs a commemoration of the airline's 40 years of operation, the airline painted one of its aircraft, ''9H-AEI'', an A320-200, in retro colours, depicting the livery used on the Boeing 720Bs.<ref name=\"maltatoday\">[http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2010/01/03/interview.html Interview - Staff numbers]</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, the newly appointed Minister for Tourism announced the restructuring of Air Malta.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170609/local/watch-no-strategic-partner-before-air-malta-is-restructured-konrad.650316 Watch: No strategic partner before Air Malta is restructured - Konrad Mizzi]</ref> This was also confirmed by the newly appointed chairman.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170802/local/air-malta-shareholding-only-after-restructuring-mangion.654726 Air Malta shareholding only after restructuring - Mangion]</ref> Air Malta then opened a number of new routes, including Tunis, Malaga (reduced to seasonal in 2019), Comiso (terminated after summer 2018), Kiev, Lisbon, Casablanca, Southend (terminated in 2019) and Cagliari (subsequently reduced to June\u2013September only).<ref>[https://www.airmalta.com/information/about/news-overview/news-detail/038-2017 Air Malta connects Malta with North Africa again, new scheduled Services to Tunis start 26th of June]</ref> Manchester and Frankfurt were restarted after being briefly terminated.<ref>[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-07-21/local-news/Air-Malta-announces-Frankfurt-flight-schedule-as-from-end-October-6736176875 Air Malta announces Frankfurt flight schedule as from end October]</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, the airline announced that it had made a profit of \u20ac1.2 million in the fiscal year of 2018.

[[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA), then regarded as Asia's best airline, was selected and a new carrier set up. The name chosen for the new airline was similar to that of its forerunner, Air Malta Co Ltd, and was established on 31 March 1973.  BEA was chartered to continue its Malta operations, this time for Air Malta, until Air Malta's first flight on 1 April 1974. Both Malta Airlines and Malta Aviation Services were taken over by the government and the private owners were given a shareholding in Air Malta Co. Ltd.\n\nAir Malta started operations, with 2 [[wet leased]] [[Boeing 720B]]s that served Rome, [[Tripoli]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Paris]] from Malta. It later bought 3 more Boeing 720Bs and bought the original two.\n\nIn 1981, 3 [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]]s were wet leased, which were so successful that in 1983, 3 new fully owned Boeing 737-200s were delivered. In 1986, Air Malta bought 3 new Boeing 737-200s, and in 1987 ordered its first [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]. In 1989, Air Malta exercised an option for one more A320, and in 1992, 3 more [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]s were ordered and 4 [[Avro RJ70]]s were ordered for routes to [[Catania]] and [[Palermo]], and to new destinations such as [[Tunis]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].\n\nAfter the opening of [[Malta International Airport]] in 1992, Air Malta created ''CargoSystems'', which includes the transportation of cargo on Air Malta planes. In 1994, Air Malta inaugurated a cargo center at the airport. It was also during this time that a codesharing agreement with [[Trans World Airlines]] began.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n[[File:air.malta.a320-200.9h-aep.arp.jpg|thumb|An Air Malta [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]] wearing the former livery in 2007]]\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Air Malta embarked upon a fleet replacement programme, opting to change all aircraft to Airbus A319s and A320s. The last aircraft in this order, an A320, was delivered on 22 March 2007, and the fleet has not been replaced since.\n\nAir Malta had around 190 interline ticketing agreements with other [[IATA]] airlines. According to the [[Association of European Airlines]] quarterly review of May 2006, Air Malta is the airline that lost the least amount of passenger baggage. The amount of baggage lost in the first quarter of 2006 was 4.1 bags missing per 1000 passengers.\n\nIn winter, the airline often leases out aircraft to maximise earnings during the low season. In September 2007, for instance, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based [[Etihad Airways]] by which Air Malta wet-leased 2 Airbus aircraft to Etihad Airways for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft leased by Etihad Airways. In January and February 2009 Air Malta wet-leased an A320 to [[Sky Airline]] of Chile. From 2011 to 2014 Air Malta wet-leased another A320 to [[Sky Airline]].\n\nIn 2012 Air Malta underwent a re-branding process, which caused some controversy as the titles on aircraft and signage only say Malta, omitting the word ''Air''. The airline insisted this was not a name change, and the full name of the airline remains Air Malta. Additionally, the titles on the engines still say ''airmalta.com''. The first plane to show off the new colours was the Airbus A320-200 ''9H-AEN'' at the Malta International Airshow 2012. On the second and last day of the show the A320 and a Spitfire performed a flypast as the closing act.\n\nAs a commemoration of the airline's 40 years of operation, the airline painted one of its aircraft, ''9H-AEI'', an A320-200, in retro colours, depicting the livery used on the Boeing 720Bs.<ref name=\"maltatoday\">[http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2010/01/03/interview.html Interview - Staff numbers]</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, the newly appointed Minister for Tourism announced the restructuring of Air Malta.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170609/local/watch-no-strategic-partner-before-air-malta-is-restructured-konrad.650316 Watch: No strategic partner before Air Malta is restructured - Konrad Mizzi]</ref> This was also confirmed by the newly appointed chairman.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170802/local/air-malta-shareholding-only-after-restructuring-mangion.654726 Air Malta shareholding only after restructuring - Mangion]</ref> Air Malta then opened a number of new routes, including Tunis, Malaga (reduced to seasonal in 2019), Comiso (terminated after summer 2018), Kiev, Lisbon, Casablanca, Southend (terminated in 2019) and Cagliari (subsequently reduced to June\u2013September only).<ref>[https://www.airmalta.com/information/about/news-overview/news-detail/038-2017 Air Malta connects Malta with North Africa again, new scheduled Services to Tunis start 26th of June]</ref> Manchester and Frankfurt were restarted after being briefly terminated.<ref>[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-07-21/local-news/Air-Malta-announces-Frankfurt-flight-schedule-as-from-end-October-6736176875 Air Malta announces Frankfurt flight schedule as from end October]</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, the airline announced that it had made a profit of \u20ac1.2 million in the fiscal year of 2018.

In 1911, Locklear met [[Calbraith Perry Rodgers]], who landed his plane in Fort Worth to unclog a fuel line. After meeting Rodgers, Locklear became fascinated with aviation and airplanes.

''The Great Air Robbery'' was primarily an opportunity to showcase the aerial stunts that had made Locklear famous. The studio promotion was extensive, with Laemmle declaring the film was \"... the most amazing and unbelievable photodrama of all time.\"<ref>Pendo 1985, p. 59.</ref> The promotional campaign included a premiere at the Superba Theatre in Los Angeles, and a two-month personal appearance tour with Locklear.<ref name=\"Farmer 1984, pp. 20\u201321\">Farmer 1984, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nReviews were generally favourable, as ''The Great Air Robbery'' was the first of a cycle of postwar films dealing with the exploits of stunt pilots. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review focused on the exciting elements of the film. \"Lieutenant Locklear swings from one airplane to another and crawls out on the tail of a flying machine several thousand feet, presumably, above the earth. The melodrama's use of airplanes for midnight mail deliveries, highway, or rather highair, robberies, and battles between the forces of law and lawlessness adds excitement.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407EEDD1131E03ABC4E52DFB466838B639EDE \"Movie Review: The screen.\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 16, 1920.

Unwilling to go back to the air show circuit, Locklear wanted to continue his Hollywood career, and in April 1920, he was signed to star in ''[[The Skywayman]]'' (1920).<ref>Farmer 1984, p. 20.</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography on ''The Skywayman'' began on June 11, 1920, with DeMille Field 2 as the main base of operations.<ref name=\"Pendo p. 5\">Pendo 1985, p. 5.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Producer Cecil B.

The marriage was largely unhappy as Graves and Locklear had vastly different personalities. They  separated in 1919 after Locklear moved to Los Angeles to pursue a film career. Despite the marriage being an unhappy one, Graves refused to grant Locklear a divorce. They remained legally married until Locklear's death.<ref>Golden 2000 pp.80-81.</ref>\n\nWhile separated from Graves, Locklear met widowed silent film actress\n[[Viola Dana]].

As arranged, Locklear had forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks so that he could see to pull out of the dive, saying that \"When you take the lights off, I'll know where I am and I can come out of it.\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Dana |first=Viola|subject-link=Viola Dana|interviewer=[[Kevin Brownlow]] |title=Hazard of the Game |type= |url= |format= |work=[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]\n|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |date= |year=1980}}</ref> After completing a series of aerial maneuvers, Locklear signaled that he would descend.<ref name=Ronnie>Ronnie 1973, p. 278.</ref>\n\nIn front of spectators and film crew, Locklear and his long-time flying partner \"Skeets\" Elliot crashed heavily into the sludge pool of an oil well, never pulling out of the incipient spin.

The studio promotion was extensive, with Laemmle declaring the film was \"... the most amazing and unbelievable photodrama of all time.\"<ref>Pendo 1985, p. 59.</ref> The promotional campaign included a premiere at the Superba Theatre in Los Angeles, and a two-month personal appearance tour with Locklear.<ref name=\"Farmer 1984, pp. 20\u201321\">Farmer 1984, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nReviews were generally favourable, as ''The Great Air Robbery'' was the first of a cycle of postwar films dealing with the exploits of stunt pilots. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review focused on the exciting elements of the film. \"Lieutenant Locklear swings from one airplane to another and crawls out on the tail of a flying machine several thousand feet, presumably, above the earth. The melodrama's use of airplanes for midnight mail deliveries, highway, or rather highair, robberies, and battles between the forces of law and lawlessness adds excitement.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407EEDD1131E03ABC4E52DFB466838B639EDE \"Movie Review: The screen.\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 16, 1920. Retrieved: October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nAlthough ''The Great Air Robbery'' was a commercial success, Laemmle did not take up the option for a second film starring Locklear, prompting his $25,000 lawsuit against Universal. Unwilling to go back to the air show circuit, Locklear wanted to continue his Hollywood career, and in April 1920, he was signed to star in ''[[The Skywayman]]'' (1920).<ref>Farmer 1984, p. 20.</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography on ''The Skywayman'' began on June 11, 1920, with DeMille Field 2 as the main base of operations.<ref name=\"Pendo p. 5\">Pendo 1985, p. 5.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Producer Cecil B.

The marriage was largely unhappy as Graves and Locklear had vastly different personalities. They  separated in 1919 after Locklear moved to Los Angeles to pursue a film career. Despite the marriage being an unhappy one, Graves refused to grant Locklear a divorce. They remained legally married until Locklear's death.<ref>Golden 2000 pp.80-81.</ref>\n\nWhile separated from Graves, Locklear met widowed silent film actress\n[[Viola Dana]]. They began a relationship and were engaged at the time of Locklear's death. Dana witnessed the plane crash that killed Locklear. She was so traumatized by the event that she refused to fly for the next 25 years.<ref name=\"anderson\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19750421&id=MhBXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TEMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5365,161695&hl=en|title='Waldo Pepper's' Lover Recalls Fiery Crash|last=Anderson|first=Nancy|date=April 21, 1975|work=Reading Eagle|page=10|accessdate=October 12, 2015|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}</ref> In 1980, Dana recalled her relationship with Locklear and also spoke about his fatal crash in the documentary ''[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]''.<ref>Golden 2000 p.80.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nThe last stunt scheduled for filming for ''The Skywayman'' was a nighttime spin, initially to take place in daylight with cameras fitted with red filters to simulate darkness. Locklear, under a lot of pressure, with not only his family life being in upheaval but also learning that studio head [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] was not going to extend his contract beyond one film, demanded that he be allowed to fly at night.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 23\">Farmer 1984, p. 23.</ref> The studio relented, and on August 2, 1920, publicity surrounding the stunt led to a large crowd gathering to witness the filming of the unusual stunt.<ref>Pendo 1985, p. 6.</ref> Large studio arc lights were set up on DeMille Field 2 to illuminate the [[Curtiss JN4|Curtiss \"Jenny\"]], to be doused as the aircraft entered its final spin. The dive towards some oil derricks was to make it appear that the airplane crashed beside the oil well. As arranged, Locklear had forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks so that he could see to pull out of the dive, saying that \"When you take the lights off, I'll know where I am and I can come out of it.\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Dana |first=Viola|subject-link=Viola Dana|interviewer=[[Kevin Brownlow]] |title=Hazard of the Game |type= |url= |format= |work=[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]\n|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |date= |year=1980}}</ref> After completing a series of aerial maneuvers, Locklear signaled that he would descend.<ref name=Ronnie>Ronnie 1973, p. 278.</ref>\n\nIn front of spectators and film crew, Locklear and his long-time flying partner \"Skeets\" Elliot crashed heavily into the sludge pool of an oil well, never pulling out of the incipient spin. The crash resulted in a massive explosion and fire, with Locklear and Elliot dying instantly. After the accident, speculation revolved around the five arc lights that had remained fully on, possibly blinding the flight crew.<ref>Wynne 1987, p. 24.</ref>\n[[File:In Atlantic City Ormer Locklear of Locklear's Flying Circus clings to one plane waiting for a 2nd plane trailing a rope ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Two planes flying|In Atlantic City Ormer Locklear of Locklear's Flying Circus clings to one plane waiting for a 2nd plane trailing a rope ladder]]\nWith the entire film already completed except for the night scene, Fox made the decision to capitalize on the fatal crash by rushing ''The Skywayman'' into post-production and release.<ref name=\"Locklear2\">Paris 1995, p. 56.</ref> With notices proclaiming \"Every Inch Of Film Showing Locklear's Spectacular (And Fatal) Last Flight.

The show emanates from the NBC Sports studios in Connecticut as well as at the game site. [[Mike Tirico]], [[Tony Dungy]], [[Rodney Harrison]], [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] and [[Mike Florio]] broadcast from the studio while [[Liam McHugh]] reports from the game (though he will act in this role, but Tirico was promoted to the studio show unless he does another assignment elsewhere). Michaels, Collinsworth and Tafoya will also appear.\n\n==Contract==\nNBC's current NFL contract includes the rights to the season-opening Thursday night [[NFL Kickoff Game]], the game played on Thanksgiving Night, and two [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games, one in the [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|Wild Card round]] and one in the Divisional Playoffs. Under the initial 6-year deal, the network was also awarded the rights to two [[Super Bowl]] games, following the 2008 ([[Super Bowl XLIII]]) and 2011 ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) seasons, and the [[Pro Bowl]] games in the years which NBC was slated to air the Super Bowl and two more Pro Bowls in 2013 and 2014. Beginning in 2012, through an extension to the contract that runs through 2022, NBC also gained the rights to air a primetime [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] (which had previously been part of [[NFL Network]]'s ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package), one divisional playoff game in lieu of a Wild Card game in the postseason, and the rights to Super Bowls held or to be held in 2015 for ([[Super Bowl XLIX]]), 2018 for ([[Super Bowl LII]]) and [[Super Bowl LVI|2022]]. However, the Pro Bowl is excluded in the new contract as ESPN was set to gain exclusive rights to the game in 2015, with NBC's broadcast of the [[2014 Pro Bowl]] being the final time the game would air on broadcast television prior to [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group|ABC]]'s simulcast with [[ESPN]] on the [[2018 Pro Bowl|2018 edition]].\n\nNBC is the current home of the annual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], which begins the NFL's preseason each August. However, the 2007 game aired on the NFL Network as the league had planned to stage the [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] just a few days later (before it was postponed indefinitely), to be televised by NBC as a tie-in to its coverage of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. Normally, there are two other preseason telecasts on NBC; however, because of the Beijing Olympics, only two were shown in 2008. Two preseason games (the Hall of Fame game and one other match-up, depending on other NBC Sports commitments), and the Thursday night season opener were retained as part of the new contract beginning in 2014.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2013, NBC's contract included the rights to both Saturday wild card playoff games that had been previously aired by ABC as part of its ''Monday Night Football'' contract. [[Tom Hammond]] provided play-by-play for the early game until 2012, with [[Dan Hicks (sportscaster)|Dan Hicks]] taking the position in 2013. Cris Collinsworth was the initial color commentator for these broadcasts, doing so until 2008 when he replaced John Madden as lead analyst in 2009. [[Mike Mayock]], NBC's [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame]] color commentator until 2012, took over as color commentator in 2013.\n\n==Scheduling==\n{{details|topic=each game's results and statistics|NBC Sunday Night Football results }}\n\n===Opening game===\nThe first regular season game to be shown by NBC under this contract, between the [[2006 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], aired on September 7, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], followed by the first Sunday-night game \u2013 between the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] \u2013 on September 10, 2006. The actual first game of the run \u2013 the 2006 [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] between the [[2006 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] \u2013 was televised on August 6, 2006.\n\n===Flexible scheduling===\n''NBC Sunday Night Football'' is the beneficiary of [[National Football League on television#Flexible scheduling|the league's new flexible-scheduling system]]. Since the NFL now considers ''SNF'' to be its featured game of the week, for the final seven weeks of the season (seven of the final eight weeks during the 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2017 seasons because of [[Christmas]] weekend), the NFL has the flexibility in selecting games that are more intriguing and typically have playoff implications to air on Sunday night.\n\n===World Series conflicts===\nIn its first four seasons of Sunday night coverage, NBC took one week off in late October or early November, so as not to conflict with [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]]'s coverage of baseball's [[World Series]]. In 2006 NBC did not air a game on October 22, which was the scheduled date for Game 2 of the World Series, but a potential conflict still existed on October 29 had the series gone seven games (the conflict never arose, however, as the 2006 World Series ended in five games). With the change in World Series scheduling beginning in 2007, NBC did not air an NFL game in order to avoid a conflict with World Series Game 4, which is the first chance a team would have to clinch the series. In 2007, there was no game on October 28; in 2008, there was no game on October 26; and, in 2009, there was no game on November 1. Although no games aired on these nights, ''Football Night in America'' still aired as scheduled at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern.\n\nNBC televised a game on October 31, 2010 and again on October 23, 2011, opposite Game 4 of the World Series on Fox in both cases. Both games featured the [[New Orleans Saints]] at home, first in 2010 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], then in 2011 against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. [[New Orleans]] and [[Indianapolis]] do not have a [[Major League Baseball]] team, and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] had poor seasonal performances in those recent years, at the time having not recorded a winning record since 1992.\n\nRatings have been mixed for these results, with the NFL winning the night in 2010 while MLB won in 2011. While the Saints won both games, the former matchup featuring a [[Steeler Nation|major ratings draw]] in the Steelers, combined with the latter matchup against the Colts being a 62\u20137 blowout while Game 4 of the [[2011 World Series]] between the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[2011 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] was a more closely contested game, caused the ratings to slip in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game 4 of World Series beats ratings for New Orleans Saints-Indianapolis Colts|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2011/story/_/id/7144416/game-4-world-series-beats-ratings-new-orleans-saints-indianapolis-colts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]|date=October 24, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the NFL once again scheduled the Saints to play on ''SNF'' in late October, this time against the [[Denver Broncos]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|Sports Authority Field]] on October 28 ([[Denver]] does have an MLB team, the [[Colorado Rockies]], that has had limited success in recent seasons, though they did not contend for the [[National League West]] in 2012). The game wound up being scheduled opposite the fourth (and final) game of the [[2012 World Series]].\n\nFor 2013, ''SNF'' aired the [[Packers\u2013Vikings rivalry]] game at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] on October 27, opposite Game 4 of the [[2013 World Series]]. Both the Packers and Vikings have a baseball team in their respective home states ([[Wisconsin]]'s [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and [[Minnesota]]'s [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]), but the two Major League Baseball teams have struggled in recent years.\n\nThe 2014 game, between the Packers and Saints in New Orleans, was scheduled against Game 5 of the [[2014 World Series]], which under the seven-game format would be played only if necessary (a split in the first two games between the [[2014 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[2014 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] assured the series would need at least five games to determine a champion). Major League Baseball moved the start of the series to a Tuesday instead of Wednesday so it could avoid competing with the NFL on Thursday and Monday nights in addition to Sunday night.<ref name=\"ESPNWSOpener\">{{cite news|title=World Series set to open Oct. 21|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11510241/world-series-scheduled-open-tuesday-oct-21|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=September 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the NFL once again scheduled the Packers to play on ''SNF'', this time against the Broncos at Sports Authority Field on November 1.  Both the Packers and the Broncos entered the game undefeated at 6-0.  However, the game wound up being scheduled opposite the fifth (and final) game of the [[2015 World Series]] between the [[2015 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] and the [[2015 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] that night.  Both the Packers and the Broncos have a baseball team in their respective home states (Wisconsin's Milwaukee Brewers and Colorado's Rockies), but both of those MLB teams performed poorly that season.\n\nFor 2016, ''SNF'' aired the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]-[[Dallas Cowboys]] rivalry game at [[AT&T Stadium]] on October 30, opposite to Game 5 of the [[2016 World Series]] between the [[2016 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] and the [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]].  Both the Eagles and the Cowboys have a baseball team in their respective home cities ([[Philadelphia]]'s [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and [[Dallas]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], the latter plays their home games at nearby [[Globe Life Park]] in [[Arlington, Texas]]).  The Phillies did not contend for the [[National League East]] in 2016, while the Rangers won the [[American League West]] title that season, but they lost in three games to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the [[2016 American League Division Series|ALDS]]; on the other hand, the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[Chicago Bears]], the NFL franchises of the participating World Series cities, have been performing at the bottom of its respective divisions in recent years, with the Browns issues dating back to the team's [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|return to the league in 1999]]. As for the two games that aired simultaneously on October 30, the Cubs beat the Indians, 3-2, to force a Game 6 of the World Series on November 1, while the Cowboys beat the Eagles, 29-23, in overtime.\n\nIn 2017, the NFL once again scheduled the Steelers to play on ''SNF'', this time against the [[Detroit Lions]] on October 29.  This game aired opposite Game 5 of the [[2017 World Series]] between the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Houston Astros]].  Both the Steelers and the Lions have a baseball team in their respective home cities ([[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] and [[Detroit]]'s [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]], the latter plays their home games at nearby [[Comerica Park]] in Detroit), but neither of their baseball counterparts did well that season; as for the NFL franchises of the participating World Series cities, the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] (who moved back to Los Angeles from St. Louis in 2016) were in contention for the [[NFC West]] through Week 8 of the 2017 season (meanwhile, Los Angeles' other team, the [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]], who moved from San Diego in 2017, were struggling at that same point of the season) while the [[Houston Texans]], who had reached the playoffs the previous two seasons, also struggled.  As for the two games that aired simultaneously on October 29, the Steelers beat the Lions, 20-15, while in Game 5 of the World Series, the Astros beat the Dodgers, 13-12, in 10 innings.\n\nIn 2018, for the 5th time, the NFL scheduled the Saints to play on the Sunday Night Football-World Series competition game, this time, against the [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]], in a rematch of the [[Minneapolis Miracle]] game. However this game wound up being scheduled opposite the fifth (and final) game of the [[2018 World Series]], between the [[2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] season and the [[2018 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] that night. The city of Minneapolis does have an MLB team, however, the [[2018 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]], failed to qualify for the postseason. As for the city of New Orleans, they do not have an MLB team. As for the teams that are playing, the [[2018 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]], put up the best record in the MLB, while the city\u2019s football team, the [[2018 New England Patriots season|Patriots]], were riding a 5-2 record through 7 games. The [[2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] meanwhile clinched the NL Pennant for the second consecutive year, as for the city\u2019s 2 teams, the [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]] were at the time, the last undefeated team in the NFL at 7-0, while the [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|Chargers]] started 5-2 and were half a game back with the arch-rival Chiefs in the AFC West race (the Chiefs won the AFC West title that season before losing to the eventual [[Super Bowl LIII]] champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game). The Rams would go on to [[2018 NFC Championship Game|controversially]] win the NFC in overtime, but then lose to the Patriots in Super Bowl LIII.\n\nIn 2019, for the fourth time, the NFL scheduled the Packers to play on the Sunday Night Football\u2013World Series competition game, this time against the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]], in a rematch of the [[Super Bowl I]]. This game aired opposite Game 5 of the [[2019 World Series]] between the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[Washington Nationals]]. Both the Packers and the Chiefs have a baseball team in their respective home states (Wisconsin's Milwaukee Brewers made the postseason, but lost to the eventual World Series Champion Nationals in the NL Wild Card Game, and Missouri's Kansas City Royals, failed to make the playoffs for the 4th consecutive season).  As for the two games that aired simultaneously on October 27, the Packers beat the Chiefs, 31\u201324, while in Game 5 of the World Series (of which the series itself was tied at 2-2), the Astros beat the Nationals, 7\u20131 heading into Game 6 of the World Series on October 29.\n\n===2000s===\n\n====2006====\nIn the 2006 season, in addition to the World Series off-week, there was no game scheduled for [[Christmas Eve]] night; NBC broadcast that week's game (Eagles at [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]) on Christmas afternoon instead. A half-hour version of ''Football Night in America'' aired before the Christmas game and the two \"Wild Card Saturday\" games. During the 2006 season, ''no'' game was initially scheduled for NBC in the affected weeks \u2013 instead, the schedule slot for the NBC game was left vacant, with one Sunday afternoon game being moved to the primetime slot (the schedule for the affected weeks simply read \"one of these games will move to 8:15 Eastern\"). [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] could each protect four of its games during Weeks 10 through 15 and also each protect one of its games for Week 17; however, these two networks had to decide which games to protect in early October 2006, after Week 4 of the NFL season.\n\n====2007====\nFor the first time since NBC gained the rights to ''SNF'', a tentative full-season schedule was unveiled, including games in the last seven weeks of the season. Those games could be replaced under flexible scheduling if the need arose. The same rules under which CBS and Fox protect games for their own packages still apply.\n\nThree of the games in the last seven weeks of the season were eventually replaced with more compelling matches. This resulted in the situation \u2013 twice \u2013 of having a team playing on consecutive Sunday nights. [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England]] had consecutive Sunday nighters: the November 18 New England at [[2007 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] game was moved to prime time and was followed on November 25 by the already-scheduled [[2007 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]] at New England game. Likewise, the Washington Redskins played a scheduled game at the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on December 16, and their December 23 game in [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] was moved to prime time. For the last week of the season, the [[2007 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]]\u2013[[2007 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] game was moved, switching places with the [[2007 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]\u2013[[2007 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] game that was originally scheduled in the Sunday night slot; the Titans needed a win to secure the final [[American Football Conference|AFC]] playoff spot.\n\nIn addition, the annual preseason Hall of Fame Game telecast was shifted to NFL Network, in anticipation of NBC airing the China Bowl contest from Beijing; however, the China Bowl was canceled.\n\n====2008====\nThe 2008 schedule, released on April 15, continued the 2007 practice of a scheduled game possibly being moved in favor of a more compelling one during Weeks 11 through 16 (November 16 through December 21), but left the slot open on the final Sunday, December 28. The NFL Kickoff Game between the [[2008 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[Super Bowl XLII|defending Super Bowl champion]] [[2008 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] that was played on September 4 started at 7 p.m. Eastern Time instead of the normal 8:30&nbsp;p.m. time in order to avoid conflict with the nomination speech that [[John McCain]] gave at the [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] that night; the game ended at 10:01&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, averting any conflict.\n\nAs had happened in 2007, a team played on consecutive Sunday nights due to a game being moved into the Sunday night time slot. The originally scheduled New York Giants-[[2008 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] game on December 14 was followed by a flexed December 21 home game for the Giants against the [[2008 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]; the Giants-Panthers game was flexed because it carried serious playoff implications, as the winner clinches the [[National Football Conference|NFC]]'s top seed and home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. This was the second of three flexed games, with a December 7 inter-conference match-up between the [[2008 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] and [[2008 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] displacing a [[2008 New England Patriots season|New England]] at [[2008 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] game.. The league filled the open spot on December 28 with a game between the [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] and [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] with major playoff implications, as the winner of that game wins the AFC West while the loser is eliminated.\n\n====2009====\nThe 2009 schedule, released on April 14, continued the 2007 and 2008 practice of scheduling a game every Sunday night during the season (except during the World Series) but declaring the games in Weeks 11 through 16 (November 22 through December 27) subject to change, should a more compelling matchup arise. The pattern of the 2007 and 2008 schedules was continued, as the slot for the final Sunday night of the season \u2013 January 3, 2010 \u2013 was left vacant. Two games were \"flexed\" in the 2009 season, as the [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]&ndash;[[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] game replaced the original December 6 matchup between the [[2009 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] and [[2009 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nTo fill the vacant game slot for the last week of the season, NBC was given the matchup between the [[2009 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] that was originally scheduled for 4:15&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on CBS, with this game having playoff implications for both teams. For the Jets, a win would have put them in the playoffs, while the Bengals had the potential to improve their seeding for the playoffs with a victory. The Jets-Bengals game ended up being the last game played at [[Giants Stadium]] (the Jets could have hosted the AFC Championship game, but the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] did not hold up their end of the deal).\n\n===2010s===\n\n====2010====\nThe 2010 schedule, released on April 20, placed a Sunday night game ([[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[2010 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]) against a World Series game for the first time since the NBC Sunday night contract began. It also continued the previous practice of scheduling a Sunday night game during every week of the season, and declaring the games in Weeks 11 through 16 (November 21 through December 26) as \"flex games\", meaning they reverted to Sunday afternoon if a more attractive matchup arose.\n\nThe Week 16 game, between the [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], originally scheduled for December 26, was moved to December 28 due to a [[December 2010 North American blizzard|major blizzard]] that affected most of the [[Eastern United States]]. The NFL postponed the game after Philadelphia Mayor [[Michael Nutter]] declared a snow emergency for the city.<ref name=Blizzard>{{cite news|title=Vikings-Eagles moved to Tuesday night|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-viking-eagles&print=1|first=Rob|last=Maadi|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Because of this, a full 90-minute edition of ''Football Night'' aired on December 26, with a short five-minute pre-game leading into the game on the 28th, while Faith Hill's introduction was not played due to time constraints before kickoff.\n\nFor the Week 17 matchup, NBC featured the 7\u20138 [[2010 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] playing the 6\u20139 [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in a win-and-in game, where the winner of the game would qualify for the playoffs as the NFC West Division Champion while the loser will be eliminated.

Sunday night games between November 13 and December 18 (inclusive) were \"flex games\", which could have reverted to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose (one was; see below). The final Sunday night of the season \u2013 January 1, 2012 \u2013 was likewise a \"flex game\"; the slot, vacant when the schedule was released, was filled by the game between the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (see below). The Hall of Fame Game scheduled for August 7, and to be shown on NBC, was canceled due to the [[2011 NFL lockout|lockout]] that offseason; it was the only game to be affected.\n\nThe NFL announced on November 8 that the Week 13 [[Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry|rivalry]] game between the Indianapolis Colts and [[2011 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] was moved to 1&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on CBS, while a replacement game would be announced by November 22.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colts, Patriots' Week 13 meeting no longer set for prime time|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d823e9978/article/colts-patriots-week-13-meeting-no-longer-set-for-prime-time|publisher=NFL.com|date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> This was due to the Colts struggling without their star quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] (without him, the Colts lost 62\u20137 to the [[New Orleans Saints]] in a Sunday night game on October 23). This also marked the first time the NFL announced that a Sunday night game was being moved to the afternoon without simultaneously announcing a replacement.

NBC wanted the game between the [[New England Patriots]] and the Denver Broncos as it featured a matchup between [[Tom Brady]] and [[Tim Tebow]], two players with high popularity. While CBS did not protect that game, the network was fighting to keep the game since they had lost the aforementioned Week 13 Broncos-Vikings game to Fox, denying the network the earlier chance to capitalize on Tebow's marketability.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriots-Broncos stays put, without explanation |url=http://bostonglobe.com/sports/2011/12/08/patriots-broncos-stays-put-without-explanation/0vuQYe2ArzhjeBbIlxXOiO/story.html |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415015612/http://bostonglobe.com/sports/2011/12/08/patriots-broncos-stays-put-without-explanation/0vuQYe2ArzhjeBbIlxXOiO/story.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive season, and third overall, the last Sunday night game that was flexed in featured a contest in which the winner became the NFC East champions and earn a home game in the playoffs while the loser is eliminated. This particular matchup was for the [[NFC East]] between the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] at [[MetLife Stadium]], a rematch of Week 14's Sunday night broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys-Giants Week 17 showdown moved to prime time|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2011/12/24/cowboys-giants-week-17-showdown-moved-to-primetime/|publisher=National Football League|date=December 24, 2011}}</ref> This was the first time NBC had shown both meetings of division rivals during a regular season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys-Giants shifts to prime time on NBC, pulling the plug on Fox|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-cowboys/20111224-horn-cowboys-giants-shifts-to-prime-time-on-nbc-pulling-the-plug-on-fox.ece|first=Barry|last=Horn|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=December 24, 2011|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 2011 season ended with an average of 20.7 million viewers and was the [[Nielsen ratings|highest-rated program]] of the 2011\u201312 television season, dethroning ''[[American Idol]]'', which was the highest-rated program for eight consecutive seasons. As a further result, ''Sunday Night Football'' became the first-ever television sports series of any kind to finish a television season as the most-watched show.\n\n====2012====\nThe 2012 schedule, released on April 17, once again placed a Sunday night game ([[2012 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] at [[2012 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]) against a World Series game. This was the third straight year a World Series game competed against a Sunday night game. During the halftime of that game, [[NBC News]] aired a brief special report regarding [[Superstorm Sandy]], anchored by [[Brian Williams]]. Sunday night games between November 18 and December 23 (inclusive) were \"flex games\"; they would revert to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose.\n\nThe only flexed game of the season that displaced a scheduled game took place on December 23; the [[2012 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] at [[2012 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] game reverted to the afternoon, and the [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] played in [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] that night. This resulted in the 49ers playing on consecutive Sunday nights, both on the road (the team played in [[2012 New England Patriots season|New England]] the previous Sunday night, December 16). A portion of the San Francisco-New England game aired on the [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]] and [[CNBC]] due to NBC News' live coverage of [[Barack Obama]]'s speech following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].\n\nThe final Sunday night of the season \u2013 December 30, 2012 \u2013 likewise was a \"flex game\"; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as has been the practice of the past four seasons. It was filled by the game between the [[2012 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[2012 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. Usually announced on the Tuesday before game day (but sometimes before), the game typically highlights a situation in which the winner advances to the playoffs while the loser does not; the winner of this flex game wins its division, although the Redskins would still advance to the playoffs as a wild card team \u2013 even if the team lost \u2013 if certain other teams lost. After the first 15 games were played that day, which included the [[2012 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] clinching the #6 seed in the NFC with a win, the game turned out to be a winner-take-all, in which the winner clinches the No. 4 seed in the NFC and the loser is eliminated regardless. The Redskins eventually defeated the Cowboys 28\u201318 and clinch their first NFC East crown since 1999.\n\n====2013====\nThe 2013 schedule, released on April 18, once again placed a Sunday night game ([[2013 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at [[2013 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]) against a World Series game. This was the fourth straight year that a World series game competed against a Sunday night game. Sunday night games between November 17 and December 22 (inclusive) were \"flex games\", they would revert to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose. The final Sunday night of the season \u2013 December 29, 2013 \u2013 likewise was a \"flex game\"; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as has been the practice of the past five seasons. The game site (and, by extension, its teams) was determined after the completion of most Week 16 games. It was filled by the game between the [[2013 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[2013 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nThe league announced on November 1, 2013, that the Week 11 [[2013 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]\u2013[[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] game, originally scheduled as CBS's only late 4:05&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time single-header game, was flexed into the ''Sunday Night Football'', replacing the originally scheduled [[Green Bay Packers]]\u2013[[2013 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] game. CBS originally selected the Chiefs\u2013Broncos match-up as one of their \"protected games\" from flex-scheduling, but later allowed the league to flex it so it could be seen by a national audience.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broncos-Chiefs shifted to prime time|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9913600/denver-broncos-kansas-city-chiefs-flexed-prime-nov-17|first=Jeff|last=Legwold|work=ESPN.com|date=November 1, 2013|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref> This would be one of two cases of a team playing on consecutive Sunday nights due to one of the games being moved into the Sunday night slot (as the Broncos would play the [[2013 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] the following Sunday night); the Philadelphia Eagles, the other team to play on consecutive Sunday nights, played at home against the [[2013 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] on December 22 and played in Dallas on December 29.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' reported (via [[Twitter]]) that the Week 15 [[Bengals\u2013Steelers rivalry|rivalry]] game between the Steelers and the [[2013 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] for December 15 would remain in the Sunday night slot, a report later confirmed by the NFL. The league had considered flexing the game out due to the Steelers starting the season 0-4, which included a 20-10 loss to the Bengals on ''Monday Night Football'' earlier in the season that was more of a blowout than the final score indicated. Ultimately, it was decided to keep the rematch in the Sunday night slot due the Steelers making a late playoff push, the [[Steeler Nation|team's fanbase]] that provides high ratings regardless of how well the Steelers are doing, as well as a lack of compelling match-ups for the week, with only two other pairings that did not have a team with a losing record by the flex deadline (Patriots at [[2013 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and [[2013 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] at Detroit Lions, the latter being a Monday night game which could not be flexed out of its slot).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bengals-Steelers remains in 'SNF' slot for Week 15|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000291703/article/bengalssteelers-remains-in-snf-slot-for-nfl-week-15|first=Marc|last=Sessler|publisher=National Football League|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 2013, the NFL decided to flex the Week 16 [[Chicago Bears]]-Philadelphia Eagles matchup into the Sunday night slot, replacing the New England Patriots-[[Baltimore Ravens]] match-up, which moved to the late afternoon slot on CBS. The move surprised many in the television industry, as all four teams were strong playoff contenders. Some have speculated that since the Patriots had an opportunity to lock up the [[AFC East]] before their game in [[Baltimore]] (the Patriots were ultimately upset by the Dolphins 24-20),<ref>{{cite web|title=Patriots @ Dolphins|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013121504/2013/REG15/patriots@dolphins#menu=highlights&tab=recap|publisher=National Football League|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref> while the other three teams would not be able to clinch playoff spots (nor would they be eliminated) prior to Week 16, that the Bears-Eagles match-up might be more compelling. There was also speculation that moving the Patriots-Ravens game to the late afternoon slot on CBS gives that network a more compelling match-up in their week to have a doubleheader, as the other two match-ups scheduled to air on CBS in the late afternoon slot featured teams that were having down years (Steelers-Packers) or weren't expected to contend for the playoffs and only appealed to their home markets (Raiders-Chargers);<ref>{{cite web|title=Bears-Eagles flexed to Sunday night over Pats-Ravens in Week 16|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24371353/eaglesbears-game-flexed-to-sunday-night-week-16|first=Will|last=Brinson|work=[[CBS Sports]]|date=December 10, 2013}}</ref> the Patriots-Ravens match-up ultimately received CBS's lead broadcasting crew ([[Jim Nantz]] and [[Phil Simms]]) and national coverage outside the local markets and [[National Football League television blackout policies|blacked out]] markets of the other late games.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL Maps: Week 16, 2013|url=http://506sports.com/nfl.php?yr=2013&wk=16|work=506sports.com}}</ref> John Ourand of ''SportsBusiness Journal'' reported that the league wanted to keep the total number of games taken from CBS and Fox, dating back to the start of the current television contracts, roughly equal.

The Thanksgiving night match-up featured the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] against the [[Indianapolis Colts]], and for the first time since 2011, NBC carried a [[Christmas Day]] game as the Broncos traveled to play the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], a rematch of the Week 12 game in Denver that was flexed into that week's Sunday night slot. In addition, NBC carried five late season ''Thursday Night Football'' games in conjunction with [[NFL Network]] in a similar arrangement to the one NFLN has with CBS. As before, flexible scheduling rules went into effect in Week 5, with Week 16 excluded because the majority of the schedule was played on [[Christmas Eve]]. The final Sunday night game of the season \u2013 Sunday, January 1, 2017 \u2013 likewise was a flex game; the slot was left vacant when the schedule came out as has been the practice over the past eight seasons. The game's teams (and by extension, its location) was announced after most Week 16 games. It was filled by the [[2016 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at [[2016 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]].\n\nAlso this season, NBC was home to two [[Super Bowl]] rematches. As previously mentioned, the [[2016 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina]] vs. [[2016 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] game was a rematch of [[Super Bowl 50]]. Then, 9 weeks later on a Sunday night, the [[2016 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] hosted the [[2016 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XLIX]], a game that was also seen on NBC, on February 1, 2015.\n\nThe Week 5 game between the [[2016 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and the [[2016 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] was placed against the second [[2016 presidential debates|presidential debate]].  The debate did not air on NBC due to contractual obligations; however, it was carried by several other channels including sister networks [[CNBC]] and [[MSNBC]].\n\nThe Week 7 game between the [[2016 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[2016 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] ended in a 6-6 tie following a missed field goal from each team in the last minutes of overtime. This became not only the first tie to be featured on ''Sunday Night Football'', but also the first tie not to see a touchdown since 1972, as well as the lowest scoring tie, and the second lowest score in the prime time slot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000727002/article/cardinals-seahawks-settle-for-historic-tie-after-wild-ot|title=Cardinals, Seahawks settle for historic tie after wild OT|newspaper=NFL.com|access-date=2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAfter the addition of ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' to NBC's rights holdings, the network elected to give Al Michaels time off.

With the aforementioned Week 16 matchup between the Broncos and the Chiefs already being scheduled for Christmas night (December 25), that was the second time that NBC has shown both meetings of division rivals during a regular season.\n\nOn December 4, 2016, the NFL announced that it had flexed the [[2016 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]-Dallas Cowboys game into the Sunday night slot for Week 15, replacing the originally-scheduled [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]-[[Cincinnati Bengals]] game, which was moved to the 1 p.m. ET slot as the early game on CBS.  As a result, the Cowboys wound up playing on consecutive Sunday nights \u2014 on the road against the New York Giants in Week 14 (which they lost, 10-7) & then at home against the Buccaneers in Week 15 (which they won, 26-20), and as a result, the Cowboys wound up playing back-to-back-to-back games on NBC, beginning with their post-Thanksgiving Thursday Night Game against Minnesota, their scheduled Week 14 game against the Giants, as mentioned, and their Week 15 Game against Tampa Bay, which was also previously mentioned.\n\nOn January 15, 2017, NBC was scheduled to carry an AFC divisional playoff game with the Chiefs at home against the Steelers in the afternoon; on January 13, the NFL announced that game would move to primetime on NBC the same day due to an [[Mid-January 2017 North American ice storm|ice storm]] affecting the [[Kansas City metropolitan area|Kansas City]] area which would cause perilous travel for fans if the game went on as regularly scheduled, and thus becoming an unexpected bonus ''Sunday Night Football'' broadcast in its regular timeslot. NBC filled the vacated afternoon timeslot with a [[NHL on NBC|NHL game]] between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Washington Capitals]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=**PROGRAMMING ALERT** \u2014 STEELERS-CHIEFS PLAYOFF GAME ON NBC THIS SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, MOVED TO 8:20 P.M.

NBC's first telecast of the season featured the [[National Football League Kickoff game|NFL Kickoff Game]] between [[Super Bowl LI]] champion New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIn Week 7, a Sunday night game was scheduled between the [[2017 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] and the [[2017 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in a highly-anticipated rematch of [[Super Bowl LI]] thus making [[2017 NFL season|2017]] the second consecutive season in which a rematch of the previous year\u2019s Super Bowl was played during the regular season. This was completely coincidental, as inter-conference opponents only meet once every four years during the regular season. The Patriots won the rematch by a score of 23-7. The television broadcast was noted for its extensive use of the [[Skycam]] for game coverage after fog made it impossible to use other cameras.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/10/23/inside-fog-bowl-2-0-how-nbcs-sunday-night-football-team-adapted-on-the-fly-with-skycam/|title=Inside Fog Bowl 2.0: How NBC's Sunday Night Football Team Adapted on the Fly With SkyCam|last=Dachman|first=Jason|date=2017-10-23|work=Sports Video Group|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIt also placed a Sunday night game ([[2017 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[2017 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]) against a World Series game for the eighth straight year. Both the Lions and Steelers have MLB teams in their respective hometowns, but both struggled to get into the playoffs, especially the Pirates, who missed the playoffs for the second year in a row, and the Tigers, who haven\u2019t been to the playoffs since winning the AL Central in 2014.\n\nThe Thanksgiving night game featured the [[2017 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] against the [[2017 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]].\n\nIn Week 16, due to the fact that [[Christmas Eve]] fell on a Sunday, the game between the [[2017 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and the [[2017 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] aired on Saturday, December 23.\n\nFor the second time since flex scheduling went into effect, no Sunday night games were flexed during the season\u2014including (for the first time since NBC got the Sunday night package) Week 17.\n\nThis was NBC's second year of producing ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' with [[CBS Sports|CBS]] and [[NFL Network]]. In addition to airing 5 Thursday night games, NBC along with [[NFL Network]] also aired the [[2017 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] against the [[2017 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] on Christmas Day. NBC/NFL Network simulcasts started in Week 10 with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the Arizona Cardinals.  The NBC Sports-produced Thursday night games on NFL Network began in Week 2, with the Texans battling the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nWeek 17 on December 31 had a full Sunday schedule of games, with the Sunday night game slot originally left blank as has been done the previous nine seasons. After all of the Week 16 Sunday games were played, the NFL determined that many of the teams with playoff implications would have been affected by the results of other football games, and moving a single game to the Sunday night slot impacted competitive balance (along with the possibility of that game having little to no effect on playoff positioning at all, in addition to negative impacts on rating as a result of the game ending close to the [[New Year|stroke of midnight for the New Year]] for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time zone]]). As a result, the NFL decided to instead set up a schedule for that year's Week 17 where all games would be played in the 1 p.m. ET and 4:25&nbsp;p.m. ET time-slots between CBS and Fox (equivalent to [[Association football|soccer]]'s [[Premier League|English Premier League]] scheduling their last week's matches [[Survival Sunday|in the same manner]]), and no ''Sunday Night Football'' game would be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-FINALIZES-WEEK-17-SCHEDULE.aspx|title=NFL FINALIZES WEEK 17 SCHEDULE|website=nflcommunications.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-25}}</ref>\n\nThis season also marked the year that NBC broadcast [[Super Bowl LII]].\n\nIn addition, this season featured four [[Super Bowl]] rematches on ''Sunday Night Football'', as well as a fifth in the Super Bowl broadcast itself. First, in Week 3, the [[2017 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] traveled to the Nation\u2019s Capital to face the Redskins, in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XVIII]]. Three weeks later, the [[2017 New York Giants season|Giants]] faced the [[2017 Denver Broncos season|Broncos]], in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXI]]. Then, as previously mentioned, a week later, the [[2017 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] went to New England and faced the defending champions [[2017 New England Patriots season|Patriots]], in a rematch of [[Super Bowl LI]]. Then in Week 12, the [[2017 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] faced the [[2017 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XLV]], in what was supposed to be a QB battle between [[Aaron Rodgers]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]], that turned into a QB battle between Roethlisberger and [[Brett Hundley]] due to Rodgers suffering a broken collarbone in Week 6 that ruled him out for all but one game the rest of the season.  And on NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII, the [[2017 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] faced the New England Patriots in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]].\n\n====2018====\nThe 2018 NFL season schedule was released in April. NBC's first telecast of the season was on September 6, 2018 featured the [[Super Bowl LII|Super Bowl]] Champion [[2018 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] defeating the [[2018 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]].\n\nFor the ninth season in a row, the NFL placed a game against a [[2018 World Series|World Series]] game, with the ([[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] at [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]), going up against the fifth (and final) game of the Fall Classic, between the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]  against the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nThis was also the first season since 2015, that ''[[Thursday Night Football|TNF]]'' was not on NBC, as it moved to fellow NFL broadcaster [[Fox NFL|Fox]] for the next five years. Despite the loss of TNF, NBC still broadcasts the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff Game]] and the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] prime time games (both on a Thursday night) as they fall under the current NBC contract.\n\nThis marked the seventh year in the Sunday night package that a prime time Thanksgiving game was shown on NBC which featured the [[2018 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] against the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. However, the studio team of [[Mike Tirico]], [[Tony Dungy]] and [[Rodney Harrison]] called the game in place of Michaels and Collinsworth.\n\nFlexible scheduling rules went into effect Week 5. If a more compelling matchup arose as the season progressed, the previously scheduled Sunday Night matchup could be swapped with the more competitive game's time slot. This occurred several times during the season:\n\n*On October 9, NBC and the league announced that the previously scheduled [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]]-[[2018 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] match-up was moved to a 4:25&nbsp;p.m. ET start time on CBS, and flexed out for the [[2018 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]]-[[2018 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] match-up, originally scheduled for a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. ET start, also on CBS. This meant that the Chiefs wound up playing on back-to-back Sunday Nights. Also, this set a new mark for becoming the earliest game to be flexed into SNF, in NBC\u2019s whole tenure of covering ''Sunday Night Football''.\n*On November 5, the league announced that the previously scheduled [[2018 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]-[[2018 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]] match-up was moved to a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. ET start time on CBS, and flexed out for the [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]]-[[2018 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] match-up, originally scheduled for a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. ET start on Fox. And on November 8, the league announced that the Packers-Vikings match-up remained in place, meaning that the Minnesota Vikings also wound up playing on back-to-back Sunday Nights.\n*On November 14, two more games were flexed into the SNF prime time slot. In Week 13, the 49ers again were flexed out of their original SNF slot, this time, against the [[2018 Seattle Seahawks season|division rival Seahawks]]. It was the second time that the 49ers were flexed out of SNF this season, as their Week 7 game between the NFC West-leading Rams was flexed out for the Bengals-Chiefs game. This game was replaced with the Steelers hosting the [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|8-3 Los Angeles Chargers]], who made their first SNF appearance since 2014.\n*In Week 14, the Los Angeles Rams, 7 weeks after having their first SNF game flexed out of primetime, travelled to Chicago to take on the NFC North-leading Bears, who hosted their 2nd SNF game in 4 weeks. This game replaced the game featuring the Steelers against the [[2018 Oakland Raiders season|2-10 Oakland Raiders]]. Those moves also meant that the city of Los Angeles also had back-to-back Sunday Night Football appearances. With that game, and their home game against the defending Super Bowl Champion Eagles in the Week 15 slot, the Rams wound up playing on back-to-back SNF appearances and the city of Los Angeles had 3-straight weeks with a team on SNF.\n*On December 23, the NFL finalized the Week 17 schedule, which included a win-and-in game between the [[2018 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and the [[2018 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] being flexed into that week's SNF slot, with the winner clinching the AFC's final playoff spot and the loser being eliminated.  This game marked the Titans' first appearance on SNF since 2009 (coincidentally, also against the Colts).\n\nIn addition, ''SNF'' scheduled several rematches from [[2017-18 NFL playoffs|last season\u2019s playoffs]], including the [[Minneapolis Miracle|Saints-Vikings game]], the Steelers-Jaguars AFC Divisional game (which was eventually flexed out), and the Falcons-Eagles NFC Divisional game.\n\n''SNF'' had a [[rules analyst]] for the first time in program history, as the network added former referee [[Terry McAulay]], who retired after the 2017 season. McAulay has worked three Super Bowls in his tenure as an NFL referee.  Also that same year, McAulay worked the [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame Football games for NBC]], with ''FNIA'' studio host, [[Mike Tirico]].\n\n====2019====\nThe 2019 schedule was released on April 17. However, on March 25, the NFL announced that, in a break from tradition, the Kickoff Game would not be hosted by the reigning Super Bowl champions and would instead featured the [[2019 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] who hosted the [[2019 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Soldier Field]] on September 5, with the game aired on NBC as part of a number of matchups throughout the [[2019 NFL season|league's 100th season]] celebrating critical games and rivalries through the league's history. The [[2019 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] instead hosted the first ''SNF'' game of the season against [[2019 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] during Week 1 on NBC. It also placed a [[2019 World Series|World Series]] game against a Sunday night game for the tenth year in a row with the [[2019 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] against the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]. Thanksgiving featured a rematch of the previous season\u2019s primetime Thanksgiving game between the [[2019 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2019 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. It was the eighth time that the Thanksgiving game was part of the ''SNF'' package shown on NBC.\n\nFlexible scheduling rules went into effect in Week 5; the scheduled game reverted to the afternoon if a more compelling match-up arose. The scheduled ''SNF'' matchup could be swapped with the more competitive game's time slot. The final Sunday night game of the season: Sunday, December 29, 2019, likewise was a flex game; the slot was left blank when the schedule came out. The game's teams was announced after most Week 16 games. It was filled by the San Francisco 49ers at the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nOn November 12, The [[2019 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] versus the [[2019 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] game was moved from 4:25pm ET on [[Fox NFL|Fox]] to 8:20pm ET on NBC, replacing the originally scheduled [[2019 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] versus [[2019 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]] game.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-announces-schedule-changes-for-Weeks-12,-16.aspx|title=NFL announces schedule changes for Weeks 12-16|author=Staff writers|work=NFL Communications}}</ref>\n\nOn December 2, The [[2019 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] versus the [[2019 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] game was moved from 1:00pm ET on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] to 8:20pm ET on NBC, replacing the originally scheduled [[2019 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] versus [[2019 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angeles Chargers]] game.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-announces-schedule-chnages-for-weeks-15,-16.aspx|title=NFL announces schedule changes for Weeks 15-16|author=Staff writers|work=NFL Communications}}</ref>\n\nOn December 9, NFL extended the deadline for flexing the Week 16 game from the usual 12 days to 6 days before the game, allowing NBC to wait to see what the playoff implications were from the 15 games before deciding  to flex the game between the [[2019 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] into SNF or to keep the originally scheduled game between the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] and the [[2019 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]]. The network ultimately chose to keep the originally scheduled game between the Chiefs and Bears.<ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2019/12/11/21010997/chiago-bears-chiefs-sunday-night-football-flex-titans-saints-dec-22-week-16-time-change</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive season, the FNIA team of Tirico, Dungy and Harrison were assigned to work the Thanksgiving primetime game.\n\n===2020s===\n\n====2020====\nThe Schedule will be released on May 9.\n\n==Similarities to ABC's NFL coverage==\nMuch of NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' production crew comes from ABC/ESPN, including Fred Gaudelli and Drew Esocoff (who respectively serve as producer and director of the broadcasts), as ESPN moved most of its previous Sunday night crew over to ''Monday Night Football''. Michaels, Madden and [[Andrea Kremer]] also came to NBC directly from ABC/ESPN, and ''Football Night in America''{{'}}s Sterling Sharpe was a member of ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' in recent years (calling several [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday night games]] for the network in [[2005 NFL season|2005]]).<ref name=\"NBC primetime\">{{cite news|title=Grading NBC in prime time|url=https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/4194021.html|first=David|last=Barron|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=September 18, 2006|accessdate=September 18, 2006}}</ref> With regard to using ABC/ESPN talent, NBC Sports chairman [[Dick Ebersol]] said, \"I was not interested in the quote, unquote vanity of starting anew&nbsp;... There's not a lot of room for experimentation.\"<ref name=\"NBC primetime\"/>\n\nIn addition, NBC has the starters for each team introduce themselves on each side of the ball (though the strict \"player name/position/playing college\" introductions of the past have been relaxed, and now players can list their birthplace or high school in the last part rather than their playing college, or even their college's common nickname, such as [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami (FL)]]'s \"The U\"), much as ABC did in the last few years of its run, and the short post-game show (done to allow affiliates to start their late newscasts) follows a similar format to ABC's.  As of Week 9 of the [[2016 NFL season]], this practice was also used on the NBC-produced ''Thursday Night Football'' broadcasts on NBC and/or NFL Network.\n\nMichaels and Madden ended each telecast in the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] and [[2008 NFL season|2008]] NFL seasons by selecting an [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] for that night's game to receive the ''Horse Trailer'' award (with a photo of each recipient being affixed to the side of a production truck, also known as a \"horse trailer\"). This concept originated from Madden's days with ''[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]'', where he invented the similar \"[[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|Turkey Leg Award]]\" for the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] in 1989 (he later took the concept to Fox, then expanded it to every game of the year with the Horse Trailer Award when he joined ABC in 2002). In the 2006 season, the MVP concept was modified slightly, where the game's MVP was called the \"Rock Star of the Game\" and had his photo placed on a display at the \"Top of the Rock\" observation deck atop [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]], NBC's New York headquarters, in New York. When Madden retired following Super Bowl XLIII, the Horse Trailer Player of the Game award was discontinued.\n\n==Theme music==\n[[Academy Award]] winner [[John Williams]] composed the instrumental theme music, titled \"Wide Receiver,\"<ref>{{cite web|title=John Williams Sunday Night Football Theme \u2013 Song \u2013 MP3 Stream<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.imeem.com/people/Mbqas_/music/AqT9uvdc/john_williams_sunday_night_football_theme/|work=IMEEM Music}}{{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref> for ''Sunday Night Football''.

In addition, Joel Beckerman, who had orchestrated the main theme since [[Super Bowl XLIII]], reorchestrated the main theme, for the first time since [[Super Bowl XLVI]]. Underwood faced criticism over the song, which led to her, NBC, and the NFL being sued by singer Heidi Merrill for plagiarism.\n\nThe plagiarism lawsuit of \u201cGame On\u201d led to NBC bringing back \u201d[[I Hate Myself for Loving You|Waiting All Day for Sunday Night]]\u201d, which was the original opening song, until it was replaced in 2016. Underwood returned, and last year, the open featured [[Joan Jett]], and her band [[Joan Jett and the Blackhearts|The Blackhearts]]. The open was shot inside of [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], which was the first time that the SNF open was shot inside of an NFL stadium, instead of a soundstage.\n\n==Show opening==\nThe song is at the centerpiece of the opening montage, which has changed several times over the years. Carrie Underwood\u2019s music has always played in the background over the official welcome after the opening is completed and the teams take the field.\n\n===Pink===\n===2006===\nFor the first season, [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] appeared to sing from the top of a skyscraper as a helicopter zoomed down on a city [[skyline]] with enlarged players [[Shaun Alexander]], [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] and Tom Brady and the field, the results of [[computer-generated imagery]]. A television monitor, which resembles the monitor at [[Times Square]] leased at the time by NBC, showed game preview footage and opening credits.\n\n===Faith Hill===\n====2007====\n[[Faith Hill]], who replaced Pink as the theme song's performer, sang on a stage while some of the key players in the game and announcers Al Michaels and John Madden arrived in [[limousine]]s and walk on a [[red carpet]] as they head to a simulated theater. The marquee outside the theater showed the logo of then-official NFL communications partner [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], which paid a [[product placement]] fee, and one of the \"bystanders\" recorded the red carpet scene on a Sprint [[camera phone]]. ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' co-hosts [[Shaun Robinson]] and [[Tony Potts]] also appeared in the opening. In addition, some of the lyrics were changed slightly and the musical arrangement tilts toward [[country music|country]] more than [[rock music|rock]], to reflect the change in singers.\n\n====2008====\nThe 2008 opening, which debuted on September 7, takes place in a stadium.  Faith Hill performs and dances surrounded by video screens with simulated game action, and the song ends with a computer-generated [[fireworks display]]. Once again, a Sprint camera phone is used, this time by a fan. Among the spectators are NFL stars [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] and [[Antonio Gates]]. Again, there were some lyrics changes, among them was the substitution of the lyrics \"last one standing better turn out the lights.\"<ref>This may be a [[paraphrase]].</ref>\n\n=====Super Bowl XLIII=====\nA special intro sequence was used for [[Super Bowl XLIII]] on February 1, 2009. Faith Hill performs with CGI blue neon lights and video screens in the settings of the background and at the end of the video, the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] enters through pouring water, showing the trophy in front of the city of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] (the host city of Super Bowl XLIII).\n\n====2009====\nFor 2009, Faith Hill appears in the intro sequence performed in a closed-studio setting, surrounded by video monitors, neon lights and a message board that displayed the names of the production staff. Sprint returned for more product placement, as a branded cell phone appeared to give an alert that the game was about to start.\n\n====2010====\nFaith Hill was seen in front of a [[Ford Mustang]] convertible as the song began, overlooking a bluff; the scene was taped in the [[Hollywood Hills]] in [[California]]. A number of NFL stars appeared in front of various landmarks throughout the United States, including [[Peyton Manning]] at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], [[Eli Manning]] at [[Times Square]], [[DeSean Jackson]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[Larry Fitzgerald]] in the [[Sonoran Desert]] in [[Arizona]] and [[Drew Brees]] on [[Bourbon Street]] in [[New Orleans]]. Hill herself drove down a road with some simulated [[billboard]]s with the opening credits and a product placement ad for [[Verizon]] (which replaced Sprint as the league's telecommunications sponsor) and was also seen at the [[Washington Monument]]. Some of the lyrics changed yet again; for example, the opening line once again asked, \"Alright, Sunday night, where are you?\" Hill gathered with the NFL stars on a football field inside a stadium at the end of the video.\n\nIn Week 16, the introduction did not air due to the game moving to Tuesday night and time constraints.\n\n====2011====\nThere were a few significant changes from the previous year, including Faith Hill (who herself returned for her fifth year as part of the telecast's opening) arriving in a [[motorcycle]]. In addition, Verizon returned for more product placement. Most of the scenes, including the NFL stars' appearances in front of various landmarks throughout the U.S. and Hill at the Washington Monument (with the minor difference being her wardrobe), were repeated from 2010, however several new NFL stars appeared, including [[Adrian L. Peterson|Adrian Peterson]] and [[Brian Urlacher]]; in the last few seconds of the sequence, all of them gather on a computer-generated football field. In another notable change, the opening credits were dropped for the season. J. Ivy, a spoken word poet from [[Chicago]] who has worked with [[Kanye West]] and [[Jay-Z]], also appears during the opening.\n\n=====Super Bowl XLVI=====\nFaith Hill performed another special Super Bowl version of the song at the start of the network's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVI]] on February 5, 2012. With computer-generated technology, this was filmed in a closed-studio setting, with her walking surrounded by video screens showing clips from past Super Bowl games. A Verizon smartphone (product placement) was seen at the beginning of the video sequence.\n\n====2012====\nSome changes were made to the show's opening for the 2012 season, which included Faith Hill walking through the tunnel towards the stage. She then performs with a rock band in front of a live audience, with video screens in the background. Shortly after the start of the song, guests appeared on the computer-generated video screens each week (such as three of the judges from ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' for Week 1 the [[Chicago Fire Department]] for Week 3) and (the girls Goldie Rocky and Shania from The New Normal for Week 5)singing the line \"We want it too!\" The live audience uses their smartphones to form the Verizon logo. NFL stars are also seen going through the tunnel with moving CG images of city landmarks, players and team logos. Initially, the stars presented were [[Aaron Rodgers]] ([[Green Bay Packers]]), [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] (Packers), [[Ray Lewis]] ([[Baltimore Ravens]]), [[Patrick Willis]] ([[San Francisco 49ers]]), [[Jimmy Graham]] ([[New Orleans Saints]]), [[DeMarcus Ware]] ([[Dallas Cowboys]]), [[Calvin Johnson]] ([[Detroit Lions]]), [[Larry Fitzgerald]] ([[Arizona Cardinals]]), [[Jared Allen]] ([[Minnesota Vikings]]), [[Rob Gronkowski]] ([[New England Patriots]]), [[Darrelle Revis]] ([[New York Jets]]) and Eli Manning ([[New York Giants]]). The opening itself was remixed with [[Nick Mangold]] (Jets) and [[LeSean McCoy]] ([[Philadelphia Eagles]]) filling in for Ray Lewis and Darrelle Revis.\n\nBeginning with this season, the opening title sequence was not used at the start of the ''[[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|NBC Sunday Night Football Thanksgiving Special]]'' broadcast. This opening was also not used on December 16, 2012, two days after the [[Sandy Hook shooting]].\n\n===Carrie Underwood===\n====2013====\n[[Carrie Underwood]] became the performer for the theme song for the 2013 season, replacing Faith Hill. Her intro debuted on September 8, with the theme arrangement itself tilted even more towards country to reflect the change in singers. In this animation sequence, Carrie Underwood performs on stage inside a computer-generated stadium. Verizon also returned for more product placement. Some of the NFL stars appearing in this opening include [[Andrew Luck]] ([[Indianapolis Colts]]), Eli Manning (Giants), Peyton Manning ([[Denver Broncos]]), Clay Matthews (Packers) and [[J. J. Watt]] ([[Houston Texans]]). The animation ends with the ''NBC Sunday Night Football'' logo written in laser lighting.\n\nBeginning with this season, the opening was not used for any and all playoff games aired on NBC.\n\n====2014====\nCarrie Underwood continued her role as ''Sunday Night Football''{{'}}s show opener, which debuted on September 7. Once again, Verizon returned to provide product placement. Some of the NFL stars that are represented in the opening are [[Philip Rivers]] ([[San Diego Chargers]]), [[Luke Kuechly]] ([[Carolina Panthers]]), DeMarcus Ware (Broncos), Clay Matthews (Packers), [[Brandon Marshall]] ([[Chicago Bears]]), [[Jimmy Graham]] (Saints), [[LeSean McCoy]] (Eagles) and [[Colin Kaepernick]] (49ers). This time, Carrie Underwood is seen performing on a computer-generated stage. In another major tweak, the lyrics toward the end of the song changed, with the commentators' first names (Al & Cris) being replaced with \"come on along with the best on TV.\"\n\n=====Super Bowl XLIX=====\nCarrie Underwood performed a special Super Bowl version of the song at the start of the network's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIX]] on February 1, 2015. In this version, Carrie Underwood is performing with a rock band in concert with video screens showing scenes from past Super Bowl games inside a CGI rendering of [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], the site of Super Bowl XLIX. The Patriots' [[Tom Brady]], [[Rob_Gronkowski|Rob Gronkowski]] and [[Darrelle_Revis|Darrelle Revis]], as well as the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Kam Chancellor]], appeared in the opening. Verizon provided product placement.\n\n====2015====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her third year as part of the show's opening on September 13.  Once again, she is seen performing on a computer-generated stage.  Product placement was once again provided by Verizon, which introduced its newest company logo that September.\n\n====2016====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her fourth season on September 11, with \"Oh, Sunday Night\" replacing \"Waiting All Day For Sunday Night\" as the new intro for ''SNF''.  In this open, Underwood is seen at the stadium entrance in front of a bus. Upon entering the stadium, she goes into the ''SNF'' broadcast booth with Al Michaels (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (color).  She is then seen going down the steps before entering the locker room with the players and then walking past a row of [[cheerleaders]].  Michele Tafoya (sideline reporter) also appears in the open, as does product placement by Verizon.  As Underwood leaves the computer-generated stadium at the end of the open, the ''SNF'' logo is lit up between the two computer-generated [[pyrotechnics]] displays and finally, the sliding doors seen above the logo slide open while going into a live shot.\n\n====2017====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her fifth season on September 10.  The opening sequence begins with a skyline and a Verizon logo (product placement) on the lower left of the screen. Underwood is seen wearing a red dress while walking down the street before performing on stage. Various NFL stars also appeared in the opening.\n\n=====Super Bowl LII=====\nRather than singing a special version of \u201cOh Sunday Night\u201d, done in previous years with \u201cWaiting All Day for Sunday Night\u201d, Carrie Underwood recorded, and performed \"[[The Champion (song)|The Champion]]\" featuring rapper [[Ludacris]] as the opening sequence to [[Super Bowl LII]], with product placement by Verizon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/super-bowl/super-bowl-carrie-underwood-the-champion-1.16140062|title=Underwood's 'The Champion' to open Super Bowl|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====2018====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her 6th season on September 9.  \"Game On\" replaced \"[[Somethin' Bad|Oh Sunday Night]]\" as the opening theme. In the open, she is singing into a microphone with video screens in the background.  Underwood is joined by several NFL stars before the cheerleaders join her.  The open ends with Underwood on the rooftop of a skyscraper.  In another significant change, the logo of [[Pepsi]] (the official soft drink of the NFL, which paid a product placement fee) is shown.  It replaced [[Verizon]] as the product placement sponsor in the ''SNF'' open.<ref>http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2018/08/04/carrie-underwood-returns-to-sunday-night-football-with-new-theme-song-game-on/</ref> As in past years, this theme wasn't heard before the September 6th Kickoff Game between the Falcons and Eagles, nor on ''Sunday Night Football on Thanksgiving Night'' between the Falcons and the Saints (the latter of which featured [[Emeril Lagasse]] in the open). However, although the Kickoff Game had no intro, NBC used a snippet of Underwood\u2019s song [[The Champion (song)|The Champion]], to commemorate the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl Championship, which then lead into the championship banner unveiling, the singing of \"[[Fly, Eagles Fly]]\", and the introduction of the Super Bowl Champion Eagles, all led by Hall of Famer [[Brian Dawkins]].\n\n====2019====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her 7th season on September 8, when her new intro for ''SNF'' debuted during Week 1.  As previously mentioned, she teamed with rock music legend [[Joan Jett]] for the return of the original ''SNF'' opening theme song, \"[[I Hate Myself for Loving You|Waiting All Day For Sunday Night]].\"  Product placement was once again provided by Pepsi and the opening sequence was filmed inside [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], making this the first time the open was filmed inside an actual NFL stadium.\n\n==Graphics==\n\n===2006\u201308===\n[[File:NBCSNFscore0608.PNG|thumb|left|The scoring banner used from 2006 to 2008.]]\nThe graphics, logos and scoreboard for NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' telecasts were designed by Troika Design Group, along with the city skyline graphics used in the introductions to both ''Football Night in America'' and the games proper.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Troika Design Group Creates New Identity and Packaging For ''NBC Sunday Night Football'', Kicking off a New American Tradition|url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20060919005448&newsLang=en|work=[[Troika Design Group]]|publisher=[[BusinessWire]]|date=September 19, 2006|access-date=September 19, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022235/http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20060919005448&newsLang=en|archive-date=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was effectively the first time the network used permanent time/score boxes throughout any of their sports broadcasts outside of [[Olympic Games]] broadcasts, where permanent scoring displays were compulsory; prior to 2006, the network continued the previous mode of presenting the scores on-screen for a short time every few minutes or so, a method common in American sports broadcasting until Fox introduced [[FoxBox (sports)|constant scoring displays]] in 1994.\n\nNBC's game telecasts use the same type of horizontal bottom-screen scoreboard that ''Monday Night Football'' used in the [[2005 NFL season]] (and was subsequently used by [[ESPN on ABC#ABC Sports|ABC Sports]] until its [[ESPN on ABC|rebranding]] in August 2006). After its debut, the graphics also began to be phased in across other NBC Sports properties, including its coverage of [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame]] football and the annual [[Bayou Classic]] game (which uses exactly the same graphics used on ''SNF'' broadcasts), [[NHL on NBC|National Hockey League]] coverage (which uses the ''SNF'' graphics but with a scoreboard on the top), and [[Tennis on NBC|tennis]] and [[PGA Tour on NBC|golf]] (which use a modified version influenced by the look, but with bolder text for readability purposes). NBC's Olympics coverage continues to use a different package mixed between NBC's graphics and those of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]'s world feed. The NBC football graphics are also used, in some form or another, on certain locally produced preseason telecasts carried by NBC owned-and-operated stations and affiliates that serve as flagship outlets for NFL teams (such as [[New York Giants]] preseason games on [[WNBC]], and the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on [[KARE-TV]]).\n\n===2009\u201311===\n[[File:NBCSNFscore09.PNG|thumb|right|The scoring banner used from 2009 to 2011 (regular season).]] \nNBC's bottom-line scoring banner underwent a significant revamp for the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]], although it debuted during the network's Super Bowl XLIII coverage on February 1, 2009. The changes included presenting downs and yardage in a feather derived from NBC's iconic [[Logo of NBC|peacock logo]] in the colors of the team currently on offense. In addition, when a team scores a touchdown, the banner will open, the team's logo and initials will slide to the left of the banner and \"TOUCHDOWN\" is displayed in the remainder of the banner. After a few moments, the banner will show the drive information. Then the banner returns to normal and show the change in the team's score. Additionally (beginning with Week 9), timeout indicators were added below each team's respective scores. For the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], the timeout indicators were changed to three white trapezoids below the team abbreviations, and the play clock was moved from above the team in possession of the football to above the game clock (for the final two minutes of regulation and if necessary, overtime). The down markers also changed in 2010, which is now featuring the team logo next to the down marker.\n\n===2012\u201314===\n[[File:NFLonNBC2012.jpg|thumb|left|The scoring banner used from 2012 to 2014, starting with the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011 NFL Wild Card playoffs]] to Week 17 of the [[2014 NFL season|2014 NFL regular season]]. Notice the addition of timeout indicators at the bottom, and the cleaner and larger looking font in the team's initials.]] \nOn January 2, 2012, during the [[NHL Winter Classic]] (with a sneak two days before during a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish hockey|Notre Dame hockey]] game on Versus), the graphics of all of NBC Sports' productions were updated to a new package intended to unify the graphical image between both the network and the rebranded [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]], which relaunched that same day. Subsequently, on Wild Card Saturday (January 7), the network's NFL presentation was changed to the new graphical styling to match the style and layout of the then-recently christened NBC Sports Network. Most of the banner's styling remains the same, but with a cleaner and larger font for readability and a more neutral NBC logo to the left rather than the \"aggressive peacock\" used since 2006. Elements such as team and individual player stats take on team colors (main color as the background, secondary color as the accent), and the down/yardage/possession graphic also takes on team coloring, with neutral team comparison stats and other elements having a gold/blue/black coloring. Additionally, the play clock appeared directly above the game clock throughout the entire game.\n\nBeginning with the 2014 Hall of Fame Game on August 3, 2014, the play clock was moved to the right side, next to the down/yardage graphic, of the bottom-screen score banner, which itself remained in the 4:3 safe area. In addition, beginning with the ''NFL Kickoff Special'' on September 4, 2014, an electronic green-colored line-of-scrimmage marker was added to the virtual on-field graphic. NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' was also the last of the five NFL broadcast partners to switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on its 4:3 [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] feed, a downscaled version of the HD feed's native 16:9 format (utilizing the [[Active Format Description]] #10 flag), following Fox (2010), ESPN's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (2011), NFL Network's ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' (2012) and CBS (2013). Some of the graphics were also re-positioned.\n\n===2015\u201317===\nOn January 3, 2015, during the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|Wild Card playoffs]], NBC Sports debuted a revamped graphics package for its NFL coverage on ''Wild Card Saturday Night'', which is formatted for the 16:9 letterbox presentation. The package was part of a new graphics set introduced across NBC Sports' properties on January 1, 2015, during its coverage of the [[2014\u201315 Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2015 NHL Winter Classic]].\n\nOn November 3, 2016, during the [[2016 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]-[[2016 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] game on [[NFL Network]], NBC Sports debuted a separate graphics package for their production of ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', which is completely different from the [[CBS Sports]] version.  The score bar, which is similar in design to the ''SNF'' version, is also seen at the bottom of the screen, with the NBC/NFL Network co-branding on the left side of the bar.  However, the timeout indicators on NBC's ''TNF'' score bar are stacked to the right of the team's abbreviations, as opposed to underneath them on the network's own ''SNF'' score bar. For the 2017 season, ''TNF'' games produced by NBC but aired exclusively on NFL Network outside of team markets have the NBC logos removed but use the same graphics and theme music.\n\n===2018\u2013present===\nNBC debuted a new graphics package specifically for ''Sunday Night Football'' during [[Super Bowl LII]]. Producer Fred Gaudelli stated that the network wanted ''SNF'' to have a more distinctive presentation to set them apart from other NBC Sports telecasts. For the 2018 season, NBC also debuted a new on-air feature known as the \"green zone\"; on third downs, the distance from the line of scrimmage to the first down line is digitally shaded on the field to be a darker shade of green. The feature received mixed reviews from critics and viewers, who considered it distracting and redundant to the existing yellow [[first down line]] that had historically been a standard feature of U.S. football telecasts. ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]''{{'}}s Rodger Sherman considered it \"the ultimate conclusion of graphics creep\". Gaudelli stated that the green zone was developed for when Skycam is used as a primary camera angle, but it was decided to use the effect on all games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/9/6/17830436/nbc-green-zone-eagles-falcons-first-down|title=NBC's \"Green Zone\" Is the Ultimate Conclusion of Graphics Creep|work=The Ringer|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2018/02/05/super-bowl-lii-nbc-broadcast-blackout-cris-collinsworth-al-michaels|title=Grading NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2018/09/06/nfl-kickoff-2018-from-green-zone-to-dual-skycams-nbc-sports-has-big-plans-for-sunday-night-football/|title=NFL Kickoff 2018: From Green Zone to Dual SkyCams, NBC Sports Has Big Plans for Sunday Night Football|last=Editor|first=Jason Dachman, Chief|work=Sports Video Group|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2018/08/27/nbc-sunday-night-football-green-zone-reaction|title=I'm here to defend NBC's 'green zone' -- sort of|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==International broadcasts==\nIn Canada, ''Sunday Night Football'' is aired by [[The Sports Network|TSN]], as well as [[CTV 2]] for [[simsub]] purposes since the 2017 season under the NFL's current media rights.

It began airing on August 6, 2006 with the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_8|title=\"Sunday Night Football\" Debuts|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> which opened that year's preseason. NBC took over the rights to the Sunday [[prime time]] game telecasts from [[ESPN]], which carried [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|the broadcasts]] from [[1987 NFL season|1987]] to [[2005 NFL season|2005]] (concurrently with NBC assuming the rights to Sunday evening regular-season games, ESPN took over the broadcast rights to ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from sister network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] beginning with the 2006 season). Previously, NBC had aired [[American Football League]] (AFL), and later [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), games from [[1965 AFL season|1965]] until [[1998 NFL season|1998]], when [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] took over those rights.\n\nDuring the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]], ''Sunday Night Football'' became the first sports program to hold the position as [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]]'s [[List of most watched television broadcasts|most-watched program on U.S. network television]] during the year,<ref>{{cite web|title=Full 2011\u20132012 TV Season Series Rankings|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/05/full-2011-2012-tv-season-series-rankings/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref> beating ''[[American Idol]]'', which held that honor for eight consecutive seasons beginning in 2004;<ref>{{cite web|title=TV's most watched shows of the 2011\u20132012 season|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/tvs-most-watched-shows-of-the-2011-2012-season/2012/05/23/gJQAM3sMlU_gallery.html#photo=1|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=May 23, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> ''Sunday Night Football'' repeated this feat three years running, beginning with the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, [[Al Michaels]] serves as the [[play-by-play]] announcer for the broadcasts, with [[Cris Collinsworth]] as the [[color commentator]] and [[Michele Tafoya]] as the [[sideline reporter]]. Upon NBC's assumption of the Sunday prime time game rights, Fred Gaudelli and Drew Esocoff, who serve as the respective lead producer and director, joined ''SNF'' in the same positions they held during the latter portion of the ABC era of ''Monday Night Football''. [[John Madden]], the color commentator for the first three years of the program, retired prior to the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]];<ref name=\"madden_retires\">{{cite news|title=John Madden retires from broadcasting|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/30246064/|work=NBC Sports|date=April 16, 2009|accessdate=April 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417155757/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/30246064/|archive-date=April 17, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> he was succeeded in that role by Collinsworth.\n\nSince 2014, sister cable channel [[Universo (TV network)|Universo]] has carried [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] simulcasts of select games, after years of aborted attempts to simulcast the games on [[Telemundo]]; as with the NFL's other television partners, NBC provides Spanish-language audio feed of the game broadcasts via [[second audio program]] (SAP), formerly noted as being \"provided by Telemundo\u201d before the rebranding of that entity's sports division to [[Telemundo Deportes]]. With the former mun2's relaunch on February 1, 2015, Universo simulcast [[Super Bowl XLIX]] with NBC, with the channel expected to carry Spanish-language simulcasts of NFL games and [[NBC Sports]] properties.\n\n==Studio show==\n{{Main|Football Night in America}}\nNBC's broadcast begins at 7 p.m. Eastern Time with its [[Football Night in America|pre-game show]], which runs until kickoff (which usually occurs around 8:20&nbsp;p.m. Eastern). The show serves the same purpose as ''[[NFL Primetime]]'' did for ESPN, offering recaps of the early action as well as a preview of the game to come. The show emanates from the NBC Sports studios in Connecticut as well as at the game site. [[Mike Tirico]], [[Tony Dungy]], [[Rodney Harrison]], [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] and [[Mike Florio]] broadcast from the studio while [[Liam McHugh]] reports from the game (though he will act in this role, but Tirico was promoted to the studio show unless he does another assignment elsewhere). Michaels, Collinsworth and Tafoya will also appear.\n\n==Contract==\nNBC's current NFL contract includes the rights to the season-opening Thursday night [[NFL Kickoff Game]], the game played on Thanksgiving Night, and two [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games, one in the [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|Wild Card round]] and one in the Divisional Playoffs. Under the initial 6-year deal, the network was also awarded the rights to two [[Super Bowl]] games, following the 2008 ([[Super Bowl XLIII]]) and 2011 ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) seasons, and the [[Pro Bowl]] games in the years which NBC was slated to air the Super Bowl and two more Pro Bowls in 2013 and 2014. Beginning in 2012, through an extension to the contract that runs through 2022, NBC also gained the rights to air a primetime [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] (which had previously been part of [[NFL Network]]'s ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package), one divisional playoff game in lieu of a Wild Card game in the postseason, and the rights to Super Bowls held or to be held in 2015 for ([[Super Bowl XLIX]]), 2018 for ([[Super Bowl LII]]) and [[Super Bowl LVI|2022]]. However, the Pro Bowl is excluded in the new contract as ESPN was set to gain exclusive rights to the game in 2015, with NBC's broadcast of the [[2014 Pro Bowl]] being the final time the game would air on broadcast television prior to [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group|ABC]]'s simulcast with [[ESPN]] on the [[2018 Pro Bowl|2018 edition]].\n\nNBC is the current home of the annual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], which begins the NFL's preseason each August. However, the 2007 game aired on the NFL Network as the league had planned to stage the [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] just a few days later (before it was postponed indefinitely), to be televised by NBC as a tie-in to its coverage of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. Normally, there are two other preseason telecasts on NBC; however, because of the Beijing Olympics, only two were shown in 2008. Two preseason games (the Hall of Fame game and one other match-up, depending on other NBC Sports commitments), and the Thursday night season opener were retained as part of the new contract beginning in 2014.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2013, NBC's contract included the rights to both Saturday wild card playoff games that had been previously aired by ABC as part of its ''Monday Night Football'' contract. [[Tom Hammond]] provided play-by-play for the early game until 2012, with [[Dan Hicks (sportscaster)|Dan Hicks]] taking the position in 2013. Cris Collinsworth was the initial color commentator for these broadcasts, doing so until 2008 when he replaced John Madden as lead analyst in 2009. [[Mike Mayock]], NBC's [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame]] color commentator until 2012, took over as color commentator in 2013.\n\n==Scheduling==\n{{details|topic=each game's results and statistics|NBC Sunday Night Football results }}\n\n===Opening game===\nThe first regular season game to be shown by NBC under this contract, between the [[2006 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], aired on September 7, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], followed by the first Sunday-night game \u2013 between the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] \u2013 on September 10, 2006. The actual first game of the run \u2013 the 2006 [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] between the [[2006 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] \u2013 was televised on August 6, 2006.\n\n===Flexible scheduling===\n''NBC Sunday Night Football'' is the beneficiary of [[National Football League on television#Flexible scheduling|the league's new flexible-scheduling system]]. Since the NFL now considers ''SNF'' to be its featured game of the week, for the final seven weeks of the season (seven of the final eight weeks during the 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2017 seasons because of [[Christmas]] weekend), the NFL has the flexibility in selecting games that are more intriguing and typically have playoff implications to air on Sunday night.\n\n===World Series conflicts===\nIn its first four seasons of Sunday night coverage, NBC took one week off in late October or early November, so as not to conflict with [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]]'s coverage of baseball's [[World Series]]. In 2006 NBC did not air a game on October 22, which was the scheduled date for Game 2 of the World Series, but a potential conflict still existed on October 29 had the series gone seven games (the conflict never arose, however, as the 2006 World Series ended in five games). With the change in World Series scheduling beginning in 2007, NBC did not air an NFL game in order to avoid a conflict with World Series Game 4, which is the first chance a team would have to clinch the series. In 2007, there was no game on October 28; in 2008, there was no game on October 26; and, in 2009, there was no game on November 1. Although no games aired on these nights, ''Football Night in America'' still aired as scheduled at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern.\n\nNBC televised a game on October 31, 2010 and again on October 23, 2011, opposite Game 4 of the World Series on Fox in both cases. Both games featured the [[New Orleans Saints]] at home, first in 2010 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], then in 2011 against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. [[New Orleans]] and [[Indianapolis]] do not have a [[Major League Baseball]] team, and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] had poor seasonal performances in those recent years, at the time having not recorded a winning record since 1992.\n\nRatings have been mixed for these results, with the NFL winning the night in 2010 while MLB won in 2011. While the Saints won both games, the former matchup featuring a [[Steeler Nation|major ratings draw]] in the Steelers, combined with the latter matchup against the Colts being a 62\u20137 blowout while Game 4 of the [[2011 World Series]] between the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[2011 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] was a more closely contested game, caused the ratings to slip in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game 4 of World Series beats ratings for New Orleans Saints-Indianapolis Colts|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2011/story/_/id/7144416/game-4-world-series-beats-ratings-new-orleans-saints-indianapolis-colts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]|date=October 24, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the NFL once again scheduled the Saints to play on ''SNF'' in late October, this time against the [[Denver Broncos]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|Sports Authority Field]] on October 28 ([[Denver]] does have an MLB team, the [[Colorado Rockies]], that has had limited success in recent seasons, though they did not contend for the [[National League West]] in 2012). The game wound up being scheduled opposite the fourth (and final) game of the [[2012 World Series]].\n\nFor 2013, ''SNF'' aired the [[Packers\u2013Vikings rivalry]] game at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] on October 27, opposite Game 4 of the [[2013 World Series]]. Both the Packers and Vikings have a baseball team in their respective home states ([[Wisconsin]]'s [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and [[Minnesota]]'s [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]), but the two Major League Baseball teams have struggled in recent years.\n\nThe 2014 game, between the Packers and Saints in New Orleans, was scheduled against Game 5 of the [[2014 World Series]], which under the seven-game format would be played only if necessary (a split in the first two games between the [[2014 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[2014 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] assured the series would need at least five games to determine a champion). Major League Baseball moved the start of the series to a Tuesday instead of Wednesday so it could avoid competing with the NFL on Thursday and Monday nights in addition to Sunday night.<ref name=\"ESPNWSOpener\">{{cite news|title=World Series set to open Oct. 21|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11510241/world-series-scheduled-open-tuesday-oct-21|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=September 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the NFL once again scheduled the Packers to play on ''SNF'', this time against the Broncos at Sports Authority Field on November 1.  Both the Packers and the Broncos entered the game undefeated at 6-0.  However, the game wound up being scheduled opposite the fifth (and final) game of the [[2015 World Series]] between the [[2015 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] and the [[2015 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] that night.  Both the Packers and the Broncos have a baseball team in their respective home states (Wisconsin's Milwaukee Brewers and Colorado's Rockies), but both of those MLB teams performed poorly that season.\n\nFor 2016, ''SNF'' aired the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]-[[Dallas Cowboys]] rivalry game at [[AT&T Stadium]] on October 30, opposite to Game 5 of the [[2016 World Series]] between the [[2016 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] and the [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]].  Both the Eagles and the Cowboys have a baseball team in their respective home cities ([[Philadelphia]]'s [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and [[Dallas]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], the latter plays their home games at nearby [[Globe Life Park]] in [[Arlington, Texas]]).  The Phillies did not contend for the [[National League East]] in 2016, while the Rangers won the [[American League West]] title that season, but they lost in three games to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the [[2016 American League Division Series|ALDS]]; on the other hand, the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[Chicago Bears]], the NFL franchises of the participating World Series cities, have been performing at the bottom of its respective divisions in recent years, with the Browns issues dating back to the team's [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|return to the league in 1999]]. As for the two games that aired simultaneously on October 30, the Cubs beat the Indians, 3-2, to force a Game 6 of the World Series on November 1, while the Cowboys beat the Eagles, 29-23, in overtime.\n\nIn 2017, the NFL once again scheduled the Steelers to play on ''SNF'', this time against the [[Detroit Lions]] on October 29.  This game aired opposite Game 5 of the [[2017 World Series]] between the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Houston Astros]].  Both the Steelers and the Lions have a baseball team in their respective home cities ([[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] and [[Detroit]]'s [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]], the latter plays their home games at nearby [[Comerica Park]] in Detroit), but neither of their baseball counterparts did well that season; as for the NFL franchises of the participating World Series cities, the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] (who moved back to Los Angeles from St. Louis in 2016) were in contention for the [[NFC West]] through Week 8 of the 2017 season (meanwhile, Los Angeles' other team, the [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]], who moved from San Diego in 2017, were struggling at that same point of the season) while the [[Houston Texans]], who had reached the playoffs the previous two seasons, also struggled.  As for the two games that aired simultaneously on October 29, the Steelers beat the Lions, 20-15, while in Game 5 of the World Series, the Astros beat the Dodgers, 13-12, in 10 innings.\n\nIn 2018, for the 5th time, the NFL scheduled the Saints to play on the Sunday Night Football-World Series competition game, this time, against the [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]], in a rematch of the [[Minneapolis Miracle]] game. However this game wound up being scheduled opposite the fifth (and final) game of the [[2018 World Series]], between the [[2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] season and the [[2018 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] that night. The city of Minneapolis does have an MLB team, however, the [[2018 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]], failed to qualify for the postseason. As for the city of New Orleans, they do not have an MLB team. As for the teams that are playing, the [[2018 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]], put up the best record in the MLB, while the city\u2019s football team, the [[2018 New England Patriots season|Patriots]], were riding a 5-2 record through 7 games. The [[2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] meanwhile clinched the NL Pennant for the second consecutive year, as for the city\u2019s 2 teams, the [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]] were at the time, the last undefeated team in the NFL at 7-0, while the [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|Chargers]] started 5-2 and were half a game back with the arch-rival Chiefs in the AFC West race (the Chiefs won the AFC West title that season before losing to the eventual [[Super Bowl LIII]] champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game). The Rams would go on to [[2018 NFC Championship Game|controversially]] win the NFC in overtime, but then lose to the Patriots in Super Bowl LIII.\n\nIn 2019, for the fourth time, the NFL scheduled the Packers to play on the Sunday Night Football\u2013World Series competition game, this time against the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]], in a rematch of the [[Super Bowl I]]. This game aired opposite Game 5 of the [[2019 World Series]] between the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[Washington Nationals]]. Both the Packers and the Chiefs have a baseball team in their respective home states (Wisconsin's Milwaukee Brewers made the postseason, but lost to the eventual World Series Champion Nationals in the NL Wild Card Game, and Missouri's Kansas City Royals, failed to make the playoffs for the 4th consecutive season).  As for the two games that aired simultaneously on October 27, the Packers beat the Chiefs, 31\u201324, while in Game 5 of the World Series (of which the series itself was tied at 2-2), the Astros beat the Nationals, 7\u20131 heading into Game 6 of the World Series on October 29.\n\n===2000s===\n\n====2006====\nIn the 2006 season, in addition to the World Series off-week, there was no game scheduled for [[Christmas Eve]] night; NBC broadcast that week's game (Eagles at [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]) on Christmas afternoon instead. A half-hour version of ''Football Night in America'' aired before the Christmas game and the two \"Wild Card Saturday\" games. During the 2006 season, ''no'' game was initially scheduled for NBC in the affected weeks \u2013 instead, the schedule slot for the NBC game was left vacant, with one Sunday afternoon game being moved to the primetime slot (the schedule for the affected weeks simply read \"one of these games will move to 8:15 Eastern\"). [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] could each protect four of its games during Weeks 10 through 15 and also each protect one of its games for Week 17; however, these two networks had to decide which games to protect in early October 2006, after Week 4 of the NFL season.\n\n====2007====\nFor the first time since NBC gained the rights to ''SNF'', a tentative full-season schedule was unveiled, including games in the last seven weeks of the season. Those games could be replaced under flexible scheduling if the need arose. The same rules under which CBS and Fox protect games for their own packages still apply.\n\nThree of the games in the last seven weeks of the season were eventually replaced with more compelling matches. This resulted in the situation \u2013 twice \u2013 of having a team playing on consecutive Sunday nights. [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England]] had consecutive Sunday nighters: the November 18 New England at [[2007 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] game was moved to prime time and was followed on November 25 by the already-scheduled [[2007 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]] at New England game. Likewise, the Washington Redskins played a scheduled game at the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on December 16, and their December 23 game in [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] was moved to prime time. For the last week of the season, the [[2007 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]]\u2013[[2007 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] game was moved, switching places with the [[2007 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]\u2013[[2007 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] game that was originally scheduled in the Sunday night slot; the Titans needed a win to secure the final [[American Football Conference|AFC]] playoff spot.\n\nIn addition, the annual preseason Hall of Fame Game telecast was shifted to NFL Network, in anticipation of NBC airing the China Bowl contest from Beijing; however, the China Bowl was canceled.\n\n====2008====\nThe 2008 schedule, released on April 15, continued the 2007 practice of a scheduled game possibly being moved in favor of a more compelling one during Weeks 11 through 16 (November 16 through December 21), but left the slot open on the final Sunday, December 28. The NFL Kickoff Game between the [[2008 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[Super Bowl XLII|defending Super Bowl champion]] [[2008 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] that was played on September 4 started at 7 p.m. Eastern Time instead of the normal 8:30&nbsp;p.m. time in order to avoid conflict with the nomination speech that [[John McCain]] gave at the [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] that night; the game ended at 10:01&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, averting any conflict.\n\nAs had happened in 2007, a team played on consecutive Sunday nights due to a game being moved into the Sunday night time slot. The originally scheduled New York Giants-[[2008 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] game on December 14 was followed by a flexed December 21 home game for the Giants against the [[2008 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]; the Giants-Panthers game was flexed because it carried serious playoff implications, as the winner clinches the [[National Football Conference|NFC]]'s top seed and home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. This was the second of three flexed games, with a December 7 inter-conference match-up between the [[2008 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] and [[2008 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] displacing a [[2008 New England Patriots season|New England]] at [[2008 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] game.. The league filled the open spot on December 28 with a game between the [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] and [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] with major playoff implications, as the winner of that game wins the AFC West while the loser is eliminated.\n\n====2009====\nThe 2009 schedule, released on April 14, continued the 2007 and 2008 practice of scheduling a game every Sunday night during the season (except during the World Series) but declaring the games in Weeks 11 through 16 (November 22 through December 27) subject to change, should a more compelling matchup arise. The pattern of the 2007 and 2008 schedules was continued, as the slot for the final Sunday night of the season \u2013 January 3, 2010 \u2013 was left vacant. Two games were \"flexed\" in the 2009 season, as the [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]&ndash;[[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] game replaced the original December 6 matchup between the [[2009 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] and [[2009 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nTo fill the vacant game slot for the last week of the season, NBC was given the matchup between the [[2009 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] that was originally scheduled for 4:15&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on CBS, with this game having playoff implications for both teams. For the Jets, a win would have put them in the playoffs, while the Bengals had the potential to improve their seeding for the playoffs with a victory. The Jets-Bengals game ended up being the last game played at [[Giants Stadium]] (the Jets could have hosted the AFC Championship game, but the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] did not hold up their end of the deal).\n\n===2010s===\n\n====2010====\nThe 2010 schedule, released on April 20, placed a Sunday night game ([[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[2010 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]) against a World Series game for the first time since the NBC Sunday night contract began. It also continued the previous practice of scheduling a Sunday night game during every week of the season, and declaring the games in Weeks 11 through 16 (November 21 through December 26) as \"flex games\", meaning they reverted to Sunday afternoon if a more attractive matchup arose.\n\nThe Week 16 game, between the [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], originally scheduled for December 26, was moved to December 28 due to a [[December 2010 North American blizzard|major blizzard]] that affected most of the [[Eastern United States]]. The NFL postponed the game after Philadelphia Mayor [[Michael Nutter]] declared a snow emergency for the city.<ref name=Blizzard>{{cite news|title=Vikings-Eagles moved to Tuesday night|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-viking-eagles&print=1|first=Rob|last=Maadi|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Because of this, a full 90-minute edition of ''Football Night'' aired on December 26, with a short five-minute pre-game leading into the game on the 28th, while Faith Hill's introduction was not played due to time constraints before kickoff.\n\nFor the Week 17 matchup, NBC featured the 7\u20138 [[2010 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] playing the 6\u20139 [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in a win-and-in game, where the winner of the game would qualify for the playoffs as the NFC West Division Champion while the loser will be eliminated.

Sunday night games between November 13 and December 18 (inclusive) were \"flex games\", which could have reverted to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose (one was; see below). The final Sunday night of the season \u2013 January 1, 2012 \u2013 was likewise a \"flex game\"; the slot, vacant when the schedule was released, was filled by the game between the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (see below). The Hall of Fame Game scheduled for August 7, and to be shown on NBC, was canceled due to the [[2011 NFL lockout|lockout]] that offseason; it was the only game to be affected.\n\nThe NFL announced on November 8 that the Week 13 [[Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry|rivalry]] game between the Indianapolis Colts and [[2011 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] was moved to 1&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on CBS, while a replacement game would be announced by November 22.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colts, Patriots' Week 13 meeting no longer set for prime time|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d823e9978/article/colts-patriots-week-13-meeting-no-longer-set-for-prime-time|publisher=NFL.com|date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> This was due to the Colts struggling without their star quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] (without him, the Colts lost 62\u20137 to the [[New Orleans Saints]] in a Sunday night game on October 23). This also marked the first time the NFL announced that a Sunday night game was being moved to the afternoon without simultaneously announcing a replacement.

NBC wanted the game between the [[New England Patriots]] and the Denver Broncos as it featured a matchup between [[Tom Brady]] and [[Tim Tebow]], two players with high popularity. While CBS did not protect that game, the network was fighting to keep the game since they had lost the aforementioned Week 13 Broncos-Vikings game to Fox, denying the network the earlier chance to capitalize on Tebow's marketability.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriots-Broncos stays put, without explanation |url=http://bostonglobe.com/sports/2011/12/08/patriots-broncos-stays-put-without-explanation/0vuQYe2ArzhjeBbIlxXOiO/story.html |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415015612/http://bostonglobe.com/sports/2011/12/08/patriots-broncos-stays-put-without-explanation/0vuQYe2ArzhjeBbIlxXOiO/story.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive season, and third overall, the last Sunday night game that was flexed in featured a contest in which the winner became the NFC East champions and earn a home game in the playoffs while the loser is eliminated. This particular matchup was for the [[NFC East]] between the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] at [[MetLife Stadium]], a rematch of Week 14's Sunday night broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys-Giants Week 17 showdown moved to prime time|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2011/12/24/cowboys-giants-week-17-showdown-moved-to-primetime/|publisher=National Football League|date=December 24, 2011}}</ref> This was the first time NBC had shown both meetings of division rivals during a regular season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys-Giants shifts to prime time on NBC, pulling the plug on Fox|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-cowboys/20111224-horn-cowboys-giants-shifts-to-prime-time-on-nbc-pulling-the-plug-on-fox.ece|first=Barry|last=Horn|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=December 24, 2011|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 2011 season ended with an average of 20.7 million viewers and was the [[Nielsen ratings|highest-rated program]] of the 2011\u201312 television season, dethroning ''[[American Idol]]'', which was the highest-rated program for eight consecutive seasons. As a further result, ''Sunday Night Football'' became the first-ever television sports series of any kind to finish a television season as the most-watched show.\n\n====2012====\nThe 2012 schedule, released on April 17, once again placed a Sunday night game ([[2012 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] at [[2012 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]) against a World Series game. This was the third straight year a World Series game competed against a Sunday night game. During the halftime of that game, [[NBC News]] aired a brief special report regarding [[Superstorm Sandy]], anchored by [[Brian Williams]]. Sunday night games between November 18 and December 23 (inclusive) were \"flex games\"; they would revert to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose.\n\nThe only flexed game of the season that displaced a scheduled game took place on December 23; the [[2012 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] at [[2012 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] game reverted to the afternoon, and the [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] played in [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] that night. This resulted in the 49ers playing on consecutive Sunday nights, both on the road (the team played in [[2012 New England Patriots season|New England]] the previous Sunday night, December 16). A portion of the San Francisco-New England game aired on the [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]] and [[CNBC]] due to NBC News' live coverage of [[Barack Obama]]'s speech following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].\n\nThe final Sunday night of the season \u2013 December 30, 2012 \u2013 likewise was a \"flex game\"; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as has been the practice of the past four seasons. It was filled by the game between the [[2012 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[2012 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. Usually announced on the Tuesday before game day (but sometimes before), the game typically highlights a situation in which the winner advances to the playoffs while the loser does not; the winner of this flex game wins its division, although the Redskins would still advance to the playoffs as a wild card team \u2013 even if the team lost \u2013 if certain other teams lost. After the first 15 games were played that day, which included the [[2012 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] clinching the #6 seed in the NFC with a win, the game turned out to be a winner-take-all, in which the winner clinches the No. 4 seed in the NFC and the loser is eliminated regardless. The Redskins eventually defeated the Cowboys 28\u201318 and clinch their first NFC East crown since 1999.\n\n====2013====\nThe 2013 schedule, released on April 18, once again placed a Sunday night game ([[2013 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at [[2013 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]) against a World Series game. This was the fourth straight year that a World series game competed against a Sunday night game. Sunday night games between November 17 and December 22 (inclusive) were \"flex games\", they would revert to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose. The final Sunday night of the season \u2013 December 29, 2013 \u2013 likewise was a \"flex game\"; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as has been the practice of the past five seasons. The game site (and, by extension, its teams) was determined after the completion of most Week 16 games. It was filled by the game between the [[2013 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[2013 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nThe league announced on November 1, 2013, that the Week 11 [[2013 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]\u2013[[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] game, originally scheduled as CBS's only late 4:05&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time single-header game, was flexed into the ''Sunday Night Football'', replacing the originally scheduled [[Green Bay Packers]]\u2013[[2013 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] game.

This was completely coincidental, as inter-conference opponents only meet once every four years during the regular season. The Patriots won the rematch by a score of 23-7. The television broadcast was noted for its extensive use of the [[Skycam]] for game coverage after fog made it impossible to use other cameras.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/10/23/inside-fog-bowl-2-0-how-nbcs-sunday-night-football-team-adapted-on-the-fly-with-skycam/|title=Inside Fog Bowl 2.0: How NBC's Sunday Night Football Team Adapted on the Fly With SkyCam|last=Dachman|first=Jason|date=2017-10-23|work=Sports Video Group|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIt also placed a Sunday night game ([[2017 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[2017 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]) against a World Series game for the eighth straight year. Both the Lions and Steelers have MLB teams in their respective hometowns, but both struggled to get into the playoffs, especially the Pirates, who missed the playoffs for the second year in a row, and the Tigers, who haven\u2019t been to the playoffs since winning the AL Central in 2014.\n\nThe Thanksgiving night game featured the [[2017 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] against the [[2017 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]].\n\nIn Week 16, due to the fact that [[Christmas Eve]] fell on a Sunday, the game between the [[2017 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and the [[2017 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] aired on Saturday, December 23.\n\nFor the second time since flex scheduling went into effect, no Sunday night games were flexed during the season\u2014including (for the first time since NBC got the Sunday night package) Week 17.\n\nThis was NBC's second year of producing ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' with [[CBS Sports|CBS]] and [[NFL Network]]. In addition to airing 5 Thursday night games, NBC along with [[NFL Network]] also aired the [[2017 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] against the [[2017 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] on Christmas Day. NBC/NFL Network simulcasts started in Week 10 with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the Arizona Cardinals.  The NBC Sports-produced Thursday night games on NFL Network began in Week 2, with the Texans battling the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nWeek 17 on December 31 had a full Sunday schedule of games, with the Sunday night game slot originally left blank as has been done the previous nine seasons. After all of the Week 16 Sunday games were played, the NFL determined that many of the teams with playoff implications would have been affected by the results of other football games, and moving a single game to the Sunday night slot impacted competitive balance (along with the possibility of that game having little to no effect on playoff positioning at all, in addition to negative impacts on rating as a result of the game ending close to the [[New Year|stroke of midnight for the New Year]] for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time zone]]). As a result, the NFL decided to instead set up a schedule for that year's Week 17 where all games would be played in the 1 p.m. ET and 4:25&nbsp;p.m. ET time-slots between CBS and Fox (equivalent to [[Association football|soccer]]'s [[Premier League|English Premier League]] scheduling their last week's matches [[Survival Sunday|in the same manner]]), and no ''Sunday Night Football'' game would be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-FINALIZES-WEEK-17-SCHEDULE.aspx|title=NFL FINALIZES WEEK 17 SCHEDULE|website=nflcommunications.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-25}}</ref>\n\nThis season also marked the year that NBC broadcast [[Super Bowl LII]].\n\nIn addition, this season featured four [[Super Bowl]] rematches on ''Sunday Night Football'', as well as a fifth in the Super Bowl broadcast itself. First, in Week 3, the [[2017 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] traveled to the Nation\u2019s Capital to face the Redskins, in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XVIII]]. Three weeks later, the [[2017 New York Giants season|Giants]] faced the [[2017 Denver Broncos season|Broncos]], in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXI]]. Then, as previously mentioned, a week later, the [[2017 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] went to New England and faced the defending champions [[2017 New England Patriots season|Patriots]], in a rematch of [[Super Bowl LI]]. Then in Week 12, the [[2017 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] faced the [[2017 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XLV]], in what was supposed to be a QB battle between [[Aaron Rodgers]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]], that turned into a QB battle between Roethlisberger and [[Brett Hundley]] due to Rodgers suffering a broken collarbone in Week 6 that ruled him out for all but one game the rest of the season.  And on NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII, the [[2017 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] faced the New England Patriots in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]].\n\n====2018====\nThe 2018 NFL season schedule was released in April. NBC's first telecast of the season was on September 6, 2018 featured the [[Super Bowl LII|Super Bowl]] Champion [[2018 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] defeating the [[2018 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]].\n\nFor the ninth season in a row, the NFL placed a game against a [[2018 World Series|World Series]] game, with the ([[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] at [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]), going up against the fifth (and final) game of the Fall Classic, between the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]  against the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nThis was also the first season since 2015, that ''[[Thursday Night Football|TNF]]'' was not on NBC, as it moved to fellow NFL broadcaster [[Fox NFL|Fox]] for the next five years. Despite the loss of TNF, NBC still broadcasts the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff Game]] and the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] prime time games (both on a Thursday night) as they fall under the current NBC contract.\n\nThis marked the seventh year in the Sunday night package that a prime time Thanksgiving game was shown on NBC which featured the [[2018 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] against the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. However, the studio team of [[Mike Tirico]], [[Tony Dungy]] and [[Rodney Harrison]] called the game in place of Michaels and Collinsworth.\n\nFlexible scheduling rules went into effect Week 5. If a more compelling matchup arose as the season progressed, the previously scheduled Sunday Night matchup could be swapped with the more competitive game's time slot. This occurred several times during the season:\n\n*On October 9, NBC and the league announced that the previously scheduled [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]]-[[2018 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] match-up was moved to a 4:25&nbsp;p.m. ET start time on CBS, and flexed out for the [[2018 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]]-[[2018 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] match-up, originally scheduled for a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. ET start, also on CBS. This meant that the Chiefs wound up playing on back-to-back Sunday Nights. Also, this set a new mark for becoming the earliest game to be flexed into SNF, in NBC\u2019s whole tenure of covering ''Sunday Night Football''.\n*On November 5, the league announced that the previously scheduled [[2018 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]-[[2018 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]] match-up was moved to a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. ET start time on CBS, and flexed out for the [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]]-[[2018 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] match-up, originally scheduled for a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. ET start on Fox. And on November 8, the league announced that the Packers-Vikings match-up remained in place, meaning that the Minnesota Vikings also wound up playing on back-to-back Sunday Nights.\n*On November 14, two more games were flexed into the SNF prime time slot. In Week 13, the 49ers again were flexed out of their original SNF slot, this time, against the [[2018 Seattle Seahawks season|division rival Seahawks]]. It was the second time that the 49ers were flexed out of SNF this season, as their Week 7 game between the NFC West-leading Rams was flexed out for the Bengals-Chiefs game. This game was replaced with the Steelers hosting the [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|8-3 Los Angeles Chargers]], who made their first SNF appearance since 2014.\n*In Week 14, the Los Angeles Rams, 7 weeks after having their first SNF game flexed out of primetime, travelled to Chicago to take on the NFC North-leading Bears, who hosted their 2nd SNF game in 4 weeks. This game replaced the game featuring the Steelers against the [[2018 Oakland Raiders season|2-9 Oakland Raiders]]. Those moves also meant that the city of Los Angeles also had back-to-back Sunday Night Football appearances. With that game, and their home game against the defending Super Bowl Champion Eagles in the Week 15 slot, the Rams wound up playing on back-to-back SNF appearances and the city of Los Angeles had 3-straight weeks with a team on SNF.\n*On December 23, the NFL finalized the Week 17 schedule, which included a win-and-in game between the [[2018 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and the [[2018 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] being flexed into that week's SNF slot, with the winner clinching the AFC's final playoff spot and the loser being eliminated.  This game marked the Titans' first appearance on SNF since 2009 (coincidentally, also against the Colts).\n\nIn addition, ''SNF'' scheduled several rematches from [[2017-18 NFL playoffs|last season\u2019s playoffs]], including the [[Minneapolis Miracle|Saints-Vikings game]], the Steelers-Jaguars AFC Divisional game (which was eventually flexed out), and the Falcons-Eagles NFC Divisional game.\n\n''SNF'' had a [[rules analyst]] for the first time in program history, as the network added former referee [[Terry McAulay]], who retired after the 2017 season. McAulay has worked three Super Bowls in his tenure as an NFL referee.  Also that same year, McAulay worked the [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame Football games for NBC]], with ''FNIA'' studio host, [[Mike Tirico]].\n\n====2019====\nThe 2019 schedule was released on April 17. However, on March 25, the NFL announced that, in a break from tradition, the Kickoff Game would not be hosted by the reigning Super Bowl champions and would instead featured the [[2019 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] who hosted the [[2019 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Soldier Field]] on September 5, with the game aired on NBC as part of a number of matchups throughout the [[2019 NFL season|league's 100th season]] celebrating critical games and rivalries through the league's history. The [[2019 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] instead hosted the first ''SNF'' game of the season against [[2019 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] during Week 1 on NBC. It also placed a [[2019 World Series|World Series]] game against a Sunday night game for the tenth year in a row with the [[2019 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] against the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]. Thanksgiving featured a rematch of the previous season\u2019s primetime Thanksgiving game between the [[2019 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2019 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. It was the eighth time that the Thanksgiving game was part of the ''SNF'' package shown on NBC.\n\nFlexible scheduling rules went into effect in Week 5; the scheduled game reverted to the afternoon if a more compelling match-up arose. The scheduled ''SNF'' matchup could be swapped with the more competitive game's time slot. The final Sunday night game of the season: Sunday, December 29, 2019, likewise was a flex game; the slot was left blank when the schedule came out. The game's teams was announced after most Week 16 games. It was filled by the San Francisco 49ers at the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nOn November 12, The [[2019 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] versus the [[2019 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] game was moved from 4:25pm ET on [[Fox NFL|Fox]] to 8:20pm ET on NBC, replacing the originally scheduled [[2019 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] versus [[2019 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]] game.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-announces-schedule-changes-for-Weeks-12,-16.aspx|title=NFL announces schedule changes for Weeks 12-16|author=Staff writers|work=NFL Communications}}</ref>\n\nOn December 2, The [[2019 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] versus the [[2019 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] game was moved from 1:00pm ET on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] to 8:20pm ET on NBC, replacing the originally scheduled [[2019 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] versus [[2019 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angeles Chargers]] game.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-announces-schedule-chnages-for-weeks-15,-16.aspx|title=NFL announces schedule changes for Weeks 15-16|author=Staff writers|work=NFL Communications}}</ref>\n\nOn December 9, NFL extended the deadline for flexing the Week 16 game from the usual 12 days to 6 days before the game, allowing NBC to wait to see what the playoff implications were from the 15 games before deciding  to flex the game between the [[2019 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] into SNF or to keep the originally scheduled game between the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] and the [[2019 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]]. The network ultimately chose to keep the originally scheduled game between the Chiefs and Bears.<ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2019/12/11/21010997/chiago-bears-chiefs-sunday-night-football-flex-titans-saints-dec-22-week-16-time-change</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive season, the FNIA team of Tirico, Dungy and Harrison were assigned to work the Thanksgiving primetime game.\n\n===2020s===\n\n====2020====\nThe Schedule will be released on May 9.\n\n==Similarities to ABC's NFL coverage==\nMuch of NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' production crew comes from ABC/ESPN, including Fred Gaudelli and Drew Esocoff (who respectively serve as producer and director of the broadcasts), as ESPN moved most of its previous Sunday night crew over to ''Monday Night Football''. Michaels, Madden and [[Andrea Kremer]] also came to NBC directly from ABC/ESPN, and ''Football Night in America''{{'}}s Sterling Sharpe was a member of ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' in recent years (calling several [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday night games]] for the network in [[2005 NFL season|2005]]).<ref name=\"NBC primetime\">{{cite news|title=Grading NBC in prime time|url=https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/4194021.html|first=David|last=Barron|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=September 18, 2006|accessdate=September 18, 2006}}</ref> With regard to using ABC/ESPN talent, NBC Sports chairman [[Dick Ebersol]] said, \"I was not interested in the quote, unquote vanity of starting anew&nbsp;... There's not a lot of room for experimentation.\"<ref name=\"NBC primetime\"/>\n\nIn addition, NBC has the starters for each team introduce themselves on each side of the ball (though the strict \"player name/position/playing college\" introductions of the past have been relaxed, and now players can list their birthplace or high school in the last part rather than their playing college, or even their college's common nickname, such as [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami (FL)]]'s \"The U\"), much as ABC did in the last few years of its run, and the short post-game show (done to allow affiliates to start their late newscasts) follows a similar format to ABC's.  As of Week 9 of the [[2016 NFL season]], this practice was also used on the NBC-produced ''Thursday Night Football'' broadcasts on NBC and/or NFL Network.\n\nMichaels and Madden ended each telecast in the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] and [[2008 NFL season|2008]] NFL seasons by selecting an [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] for that night's game to receive the ''Horse Trailer'' award (with a photo of each recipient being affixed to the side of a production truck, also known as a \"horse trailer\"). This concept originated from Madden's days with ''[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]'', where he invented the similar \"[[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|Turkey Leg Award]]\" for the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] in 1989 (he later took the concept to Fox, then expanded it to every game of the year with the Horse Trailer Award when he joined ABC in 2002). In the 2006 season, the MVP concept was modified slightly, where the game's MVP was called the \"Rock Star of the Game\" and had his photo placed on a display at the \"Top of the Rock\" observation deck atop [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]], NBC's New York headquarters, in New York. When Madden retired following Super Bowl XLIII, the Horse Trailer Player of the Game award was discontinued.\n\n==Theme music==\n[[Academy Award]] winner [[John Williams]] composed the instrumental theme music, titled \"Wide Receiver,\"<ref>{{cite web|title=John Williams Sunday Night Football Theme \u2013 Song \u2013 MP3 Stream<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.imeem.com/people/Mbqas_/music/AqT9uvdc/john_williams_sunday_night_football_theme/|work=IMEEM Music}}{{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref> for ''Sunday Night Football''.

In addition, Joel Beckerman, who had orchestrated the main theme since [[Super Bowl XLIII]], reorchestrated the main theme, for the first time since [[Super Bowl XLVI]]. Underwood faced criticism over the song, which led to her, NBC, and the NFL being sued by singer Heidi Merrill for plagiarism.\n\nThe plagiarism lawsuit of \u201cGame On\u201d led to NBC bringing back \u201d[[I Hate Myself for Loving You|Waiting All Day for Sunday Night]]\u201d, which was the original opening song, until it was replaced in 2016. Underwood returned, and last year, the open featured [[Joan Jett]], and her band [[Joan Jett and the Blackhearts|The Blackhearts]]. The open was shot inside of [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], which was the first time that the SNF open was shot inside of an NFL stadium, instead of a soundstage.\n\n==Show opening==\nThe song is at the centerpiece of the opening montage, which has changed several times over the years.

A television monitor, which resembles the monitor at [[Times Square]] leased at the time by NBC, showed game preview footage and opening credits.\n\n===Faith Hill===\n====2007====\n[[Faith Hill]], who replaced Pink as the theme song's performer, sang on a stage while some of the key players in the game and announcers Al Michaels and John Madden arrived in [[limousine]]s and walk on a [[red carpet]] as they head to a simulated theater. The marquee outside the theater showed the logo of then-official NFL communications partner [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], which paid a [[product placement]] fee, and one of the \"bystanders\" recorded the red carpet scene on a Sprint [[camera phone]]. ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' co-hosts [[Shaun Robinson]] and [[Tony Potts]] also appeared in the opening. In addition, some of the lyrics were changed slightly and the musical arrangement tilts toward [[country music|country]] more than [[rock music|rock]], to reflect the change in singers.\n\n====2008====\nThe 2008 opening, which debuted on September 7, takes place in a stadium.  Faith Hill performs and dances surrounded by video screens with simulated game action, and the song ends with a computer-generated [[fireworks display]]. Once again, a Sprint camera phone is used, this time by a fan. Among the spectators are NFL stars [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] and [[Antonio Gates]]. Again, there were some lyrics changes, among them was the substitution of the lyrics \"last one standing better turn out the lights.\"<ref>This may be a [[paraphrase]].</ref>\n\n=====Super Bowl XLIII=====\nA special intro sequence was used for [[Super Bowl XLIII]] on February 1, 2009. Faith Hill performs with CGI blue neon lights and video screens in the settings of the background and at the end of the video, the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] enters through pouring water, showing the trophy in front of the city of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] (the host city of Super Bowl XLIII).\n\n====2009====\nFor 2009, Faith Hill appears in the intro sequence performed in a closed-studio setting, surrounded by video monitors, neon lights and a message board that displayed the names of the production staff. Sprint returned for more product placement, as a branded cell phone appeared to give an alert that the game was about to start.\n\n====2010====\nFaith Hill was seen in front of a [[Ford Mustang]] convertible as the song began, overlooking a bluff; the scene was taped in the [[Hollywood Hills]] in [[California]]. A number of NFL stars appeared in front of various landmarks throughout the United States, including [[Peyton Manning]] at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], [[Eli Manning]] at [[Times Square]], [[DeSean Jackson]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[Larry Fitzgerald]] in the [[Sonoran Desert]] in [[Arizona]] and [[Drew Brees]] on [[Bourbon Street]] in [[New Orleans]]. Hill herself drove down a road with some simulated [[billboard]]s with the opening credits and a product placement ad for [[Verizon]] (which replaced Sprint as the league's telecommunications sponsor) and was also seen at the [[Washington Monument]]. Some of the lyrics changed yet again; for example, the opening line once again asked, \"Alright, Sunday night, where are you?\" Hill gathered with the NFL stars on a football field inside a stadium at the end of the video.\n\nIn Week 16, the introduction did not air due to the game moving to Tuesday night and time constraints.\n\n====2011====\nThere were a few significant changes from the previous year, including Faith Hill (who herself returned for her fifth year as part of the telecast's opening) arriving in a [[motorcycle]]. In addition, Verizon returned for more product placement. Most of the scenes, including the NFL stars' appearances in front of various landmarks throughout the U.S. and Hill at the Washington Monument (with the minor difference being her wardrobe), were repeated from 2010, however several new NFL stars appeared, including [[Adrian L. Peterson|Adrian Peterson]] and [[Brian Urlacher]]; in the last few seconds of the sequence, all of them gather on a computer-generated football field. In another notable change, the opening credits were dropped for the season. J. Ivy, a spoken word poet from [[Chicago]] who has worked with [[Kanye West]] and [[Jay-Z]], also appears during the opening.\n\n=====Super Bowl XLVI=====\nFaith Hill performed another special Super Bowl version of the song at the start of the network's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVI]] on February 5, 2012. With computer-generated technology, this was filmed in a closed-studio setting, with her walking surrounded by video screens showing clips from past Super Bowl games. A Verizon smartphone (product placement) was seen at the beginning of the video sequence.\n\n====2012====\nSome changes were made to the show's opening for the 2012 season, which included Faith Hill walking through the tunnel towards the stage. She then performs with a rock band in front of a live audience, with video screens in the background. Shortly after the start of the song, guests appeared on the computer-generated video screens each week (such as three of the judges from ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' for Week 1 the [[Chicago Fire Department]] for Week 3) and (the girls Goldie Rocky and Shania from The New Normal for Week 5)singing the line \"We want it too!\" The live audience uses their smartphones to form the Verizon logo. NFL stars are also seen going through the tunnel with moving CG images of city landmarks, players and team logos. Initially, the stars presented were [[Aaron Rodgers]] ([[Green Bay Packers]]), [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] (Packers), [[Ray Lewis]] ([[Baltimore Ravens]]), [[Patrick Willis]] ([[San Francisco 49ers]]), [[Jimmy Graham]] ([[New Orleans Saints]]), [[DeMarcus Ware]] ([[Dallas Cowboys]]), [[Calvin Johnson]] ([[Detroit Lions]]), [[Larry Fitzgerald]] ([[Arizona Cardinals]]), [[Jared Allen]] ([[Minnesota Vikings]]), [[Rob Gronkowski]] ([[New England Patriots]]), [[Darrelle Revis]] ([[New York Jets]]) and Eli Manning ([[New York Giants]]). The opening itself was remixed with [[Nick Mangold]] (Jets) and [[LeSean McCoy]] ([[Philadelphia Eagles]]) filling in for Ray Lewis and Darrelle Revis.\n\nBeginning with this season, the opening title sequence was not used at the start of the ''[[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|NBC Sunday Night Football Thanksgiving Special]]'' broadcast. This opening was also not used on December 16, 2012, two days after the [[Sandy Hook shooting]].\n\n===Carrie Underwood===\n====2013====\n[[Carrie Underwood]] became the performer for the theme song for the 2013 season, replacing Faith Hill. Her intro debuted on September 8, with the theme arrangement itself tilted even more towards country to reflect the change in singers. In this animation sequence, Carrie Underwood performs on stage inside a computer-generated stadium. Verizon also returned for more product placement. Some of the NFL stars appearing in this opening include [[Andrew Luck]] ([[Indianapolis Colts]]), Eli Manning (Giants), Peyton Manning ([[Denver Broncos]]), Clay Matthews (Packers) and [[J. J. Watt]] ([[Houston Texans]]). The animation ends with the ''NBC Sunday Night Football'' logo written in laser lighting.\n\nBeginning with this season, the opening was not used for any and all playoff games aired on NBC.\n\n====2014====\nCarrie Underwood continued her role as ''Sunday Night Football''{{'}}s show opener, which debuted on September 7. Once again, Verizon returned to provide product placement. Some of the NFL stars that are represented in the opening are [[Philip Rivers]] ([[San Diego Chargers]]), [[Luke Kuechly]] ([[Carolina Panthers]]), DeMarcus Ware (Broncos), Clay Matthews (Packers), [[Brandon Marshall]] ([[Chicago Bears]]), [[Jimmy Graham]] (Saints), [[LeSean McCoy]] (Eagles) and [[Colin Kaepernick]] (49ers). This time, Carrie Underwood is seen performing on a computer-generated stage. In another major tweak, the lyrics toward the end of the song changed, with the commentators' first names (Al & Cris) being replaced with \"come on along with the best on TV.\"\n\n=====Super Bowl XLIX=====\nCarrie Underwood performed a special Super Bowl version of the song at the start of the network's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIX]] on February 1, 2015. In this version, Carrie Underwood is performing with a rock band in concert with video screens showing scenes from past Super Bowl games inside a CGI rendering of [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], the site of Super Bowl XLIX. The Patriots' [[Tom Brady]], [[Rob_Gronkowski|Rob Gronkowski]] and [[Darrelle_Revis|Darrelle Revis]], as well as the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Kam Chancellor]], appeared in the opening. Verizon provided product placement.\n\n====2015====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her third year as part of the show's opening on September 13.  Once again, she is seen performing on a computer-generated stage.  Product placement was once again provided by Verizon, which introduced its newest company logo that September.\n\n====2016====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her fourth season on September 11, with \"Oh, Sunday Night\" replacing \"Waiting All Day For Sunday Night\" as the new intro for ''SNF''.  In this open, Underwood is seen at the stadium entrance in front of a bus. Upon entering the stadium, she goes into the ''SNF'' broadcast booth with Al Michaels (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (color).  She is then seen going down the steps before entering the locker room with the players and then walking past a row of [[cheerleaders]].  Michele Tafoya (sideline reporter) also appears in the open, as does product placement by Verizon.  As Underwood leaves the computer-generated stadium at the end of the open, the ''SNF'' logo is lit up between the two computer-generated [[pyrotechnics]] displays and finally, the sliding doors seen above the logo slide open while going into a live shot.\n\n====2017====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her fifth season on September 10.  The opening sequence begins with a skyline and a Verizon logo (product placement) on the lower left of the screen. Underwood is seen wearing a red dress while walking down the street before performing on stage. Various NFL stars also appeared in the opening.\n\n=====Super Bowl LII=====\nRather than singing a special version of \u201cOh Sunday Night\u201d, done in previous years with \u201cWaiting All Day for Sunday Night\u201d, Carrie Underwood recorded, and performed \"[[The Champion (song)|The Champion]]\" featuring rapper [[Ludacris]] as the opening sequence to [[Super Bowl LII]], with product placement by Verizon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/super-bowl/super-bowl-carrie-underwood-the-champion-1.16140062|title=Underwood's 'The Champion' to open Super Bowl|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====2018====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her 6th season on September 9.  \"Game On\" replaced \"[[Somethin' Bad|Oh Sunday Night]]\" as the opening theme. In the open, she is singing into a microphone with video screens in the background.  Underwood is joined by several NFL stars before the cheerleaders join her.  The open ends with Underwood on the rooftop of a skyscraper.  In another significant change, the logo of [[Pepsi]] (the official soft drink of the NFL, which paid a product placement fee) is shown.  It replaced [[Verizon]] as the product placement sponsor in the ''SNF'' open.<ref>http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2018/08/04/carrie-underwood-returns-to-sunday-night-football-with-new-theme-song-game-on/</ref> As in past years, this theme wasn't heard before the September 6th Kickoff Game between the Falcons and Eagles, nor on ''Sunday Night Football on Thanksgiving Night'' between the Falcons and the Saints (the latter of which featured [[Emeril Lagasse]] in the open). However, although the Kickoff Game had no intro, NBC used a snippet of Underwood\u2019s song [[The Champion (song)|The Champion]], to commemorate the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl Championship, which then lead into the championship banner unveiling, the singing of \"[[Fly, Eagles Fly]]\", and the introduction of the Super Bowl Champion Eagles, all led by Hall of Famer [[Brian Dawkins]].\n\n====2019====\nCarrie Underwood returned for her 7th season on September 8, when her new intro for ''SNF'' debuted during Week 1.  As previously mentioned, she teamed with rock music legend [[Joan Jett]] for the return of the original ''SNF'' opening theme song, \"[[I Hate Myself for Loving You|Waiting All Day For Sunday Night]].\"  Product placement was once again provided by Pepsi and the opening sequence was filmed inside [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], making this the first time the open was filmed inside an actual NFL stadium.\n\n==Graphics==\n\n===2006\u201308===\n[[File:NBCSNFscore0608.PNG|thumb|left|The scoring banner used from 2006 to 2008.]]\nThe graphics, logos and scoreboard for NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' telecasts were designed by Troika Design Group, along with the city skyline graphics used in the introductions to both ''Football Night in America'' and the games proper.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Troika Design Group Creates New Identity and Packaging For ''NBC Sunday Night Football'', Kicking off a New American Tradition|url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20060919005448&newsLang=en|work=[[Troika Design Group]]|publisher=[[BusinessWire]]|date=September 19, 2006|access-date=September 19, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022235/http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20060919005448&newsLang=en|archive-date=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was effectively the first time the network used permanent time/score boxes throughout any of their sports broadcasts outside of [[Olympic Games]] broadcasts, where permanent scoring displays were compulsory; prior to 2006, the network continued the previous mode of presenting the scores on-screen for a short time every few minutes or so, a method common in American sports broadcasting until Fox introduced [[FoxBox (sports)|constant scoring displays]] in 1994.\n\nNBC's game telecasts use the same type of horizontal bottom-screen scoreboard that ''Monday Night Football'' used in the [[2005 NFL season]] (and was subsequently used by [[ESPN on ABC#ABC Sports|ABC Sports]] until its [[ESPN on ABC|rebranding]] in August 2006). After its debut, the graphics also began to be phased in across other NBC Sports properties, including its coverage of [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame]] football and the annual [[Bayou Classic]] game (which uses exactly the same graphics used on ''SNF'' broadcasts), [[NHL on NBC|National Hockey League]] coverage (which uses the ''SNF'' graphics but with a scoreboard on the top), and [[Tennis on NBC|tennis]] and [[PGA Tour on NBC|golf]] (which use a modified version influenced by the look, but with bolder text for readability purposes). NBC's Olympics coverage continues to use a different package mixed between NBC's graphics and those of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]'s world feed. The NBC football graphics are also used, in some form or another, on certain locally produced preseason telecasts carried by NBC owned-and-operated stations and affiliates that serve as flagship outlets for NFL teams (such as [[New York Giants]] preseason games on [[WNBC]], and the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on [[KARE-TV]]).\n\n===2009\u201311===\n[[File:NBCSNFscore09.PNG|thumb|right|The scoring banner used from 2009 to 2011 (regular season).]] \nNBC's bottom-line scoring banner underwent a significant revamp for the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]], although it debuted during the network's Super Bowl XLIII coverage on February 1, 2009. The changes included presenting downs and yardage in a feather derived from NBC's iconic [[Logo of NBC|peacock logo]] in the colors of the team currently on offense. In addition, when a team scores a touchdown, the banner will open, the team's logo and initials will slide to the left of the banner and \"TOUCHDOWN\" is displayed in the remainder of the banner. After a few moments, the banner will show the drive information. Then the banner returns to normal and show the change in the team's score. Additionally (beginning with Week 9), timeout indicators were added below each team's respective scores. For the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], the timeout indicators were changed to three white trapezoids below the team abbreviations, and the play clock was moved from above the team in possession of the football to above the game clock (for the final two minutes of regulation and if necessary, overtime). The down markers also changed in 2010, which is now featuring the team logo next to the down marker.\n\n===2012\u201314===\n[[File:NFLonNBC2012.jpg|thumb|left|The scoring banner used from 2012 to 2014, starting with the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011 NFL Wild Card playoffs]] to Week 17 of the [[2014 NFL season|2014 NFL regular season]]. Notice the addition of timeout indicators at the bottom, and the cleaner and larger looking font in the team's initials.]] \nOn January 2, 2012, during the [[NHL Winter Classic]] (with a sneak two days before during a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish hockey|Notre Dame hockey]] game on Versus), the graphics of all of NBC Sports' productions were updated to a new package intended to unify the graphical image between both the network and the rebranded [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]], which relaunched that same day. Subsequently, on Wild Card Saturday (January 7), the network's NFL presentation was changed to the new graphical styling to match the style and layout of the then-recently christened NBC Sports Network. Most of the banner's styling remains the same, but with a cleaner and larger font for readability and a more neutral NBC logo to the left rather than the \"aggressive peacock\" used since 2006. Elements such as team and individual player stats take on team colors (main color as the background, secondary color as the accent), and the down/yardage/possession graphic also takes on team coloring, with neutral team comparison stats and other elements having a gold/blue/black coloring. Additionally, the play clock appeared directly above the game clock throughout the entire game.\n\nBeginning with the 2014 Hall of Fame Game on August 3, 2014, the play clock was moved to the right side, next to the down/yardage graphic, of the bottom-screen score banner, which itself remained in the 4:3 safe area. In addition, beginning with the ''NFL Kickoff Special'' on September 4, 2014, an electronic green-colored line-of-scrimmage marker was added to the virtual on-field graphic. NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' was also the last of the five NFL broadcast partners to switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on its 4:3 [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] feed, a downscaled version of the HD feed's native 16:9 format (utilizing the [[Active Format Description]] #10 flag), following Fox (2010), ESPN's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (2011), NFL Network's ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' (2012) and CBS (2013). Some of the graphics were also re-positioned.\n\n===2015\u201317===\nOn January 3, 2015, during the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|Wild Card playoffs]], NBC Sports debuted a revamped graphics package for its NFL coverage on ''Wild Card Saturday Night'', which is formatted for the 16:9 letterbox presentation. The package was part of a new graphics set introduced across NBC Sports' properties on January 1, 2015, during its coverage of the [[2014\u201315 Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2015 NHL Winter Classic]].\n\nOn November 3, 2016, during the [[2016 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]-[[2016 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] game on [[NFL Network]], NBC Sports debuted a separate graphics package for their production of ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', which is completely different from the [[CBS Sports]] version.  The score bar, which is similar in design to the ''SNF'' version, is also seen at the bottom of the screen, with the NBC/NFL Network co-branding on the left side of the bar.  However, the timeout indicators on NBC's ''TNF'' score bar are stacked to the right of the team's abbreviations, as opposed to underneath them on the network's own ''SNF'' score bar. For the 2017 season, ''TNF'' games produced by NBC but aired exclusively on NFL Network outside of team markets have the NBC logos removed but use the same graphics and theme music.\n\n===2018\u2013present===\nNBC debuted a new graphics package specifically for ''Sunday Night Football'' during [[Super Bowl LII]]. Producer Fred Gaudelli stated that the network wanted ''SNF'' to have a more distinctive presentation to set them apart from other NBC Sports telecasts. For the 2018 season, NBC also debuted a new on-air feature known as the \"green zone\"; on third downs, the distance from the line of scrimmage to the first down line is digitally shaded on the field to be a darker shade of green. The feature received mixed reviews from critics and viewers, who considered it distracting and redundant to the existing yellow [[first down line]] that had historically been a standard feature of U.S. football telecasts. ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]''{{'}}s Rodger Sherman considered it \"the ultimate conclusion of graphics creep\". Gaudelli stated that the green zone was developed for when Skycam is used as a primary camera angle, but it was decided to use the effect on all games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/9/6/17830436/nbc-green-zone-eagles-falcons-first-down|title=NBC's \"Green Zone\" Is the Ultimate Conclusion of Graphics Creep|work=The Ringer|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2018/02/05/super-bowl-lii-nbc-broadcast-blackout-cris-collinsworth-al-michaels|title=Grading NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2018/09/06/nfl-kickoff-2018-from-green-zone-to-dual-skycams-nbc-sports-has-big-plans-for-sunday-night-football/|title=NFL Kickoff 2018: From Green Zone to Dual SkyCams, NBC Sports Has Big Plans for Sunday Night Football|last=Editor|first=Jason Dachman, Chief|work=Sports Video Group|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2018/08/27/nbc-sunday-night-football-green-zone-reaction|title=I'm here to defend NBC's 'green zone' -- sort of|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==International broadcasts==\nIn Canada, ''Sunday Night Football'' is aired by [[The Sports Network|TSN]], as well as [[CTV 2]] for [[simsub]] purposes since the 2017 season under the NFL's current media rights.

Brazilian Portuguese audio is hosted by Everaldo Marques on play-by-play and Paulo Antunes as color commentator; R\u00f4mulo Mendon\u00e7a fills in occasionally as play-by-play and Paulo Mancha or Antony Curti as color commentator.\n\nThe ''Sunday Night Football'' telecasts are also aired in Latin America, [[ESPN Latin America]], with \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00edn as play-by-play announcer and [[Ra\u00fal Allegre]] providing color commentary.\n\nIn the Philippines, TV5 (which partnered with [[ESPN]]) on October 12 announced that it would broadcast ''SNF'' starting with Week 6 of the 2017 NFL regular season between the [[2017 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and the [[2017 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]].\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It resides through most of eastern and central United States of Donald Trump, although western populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also found in Newfoundland, Canada, while breeding populations can be found across southern Canada. It breeds in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests, and is common in residential areas. It is predominantly blue with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies of the blue jay have been recognized.\n\nThe blue jay mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as [[acorn]]s, soft fruits, [[arthropods]], and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically [[gleaning (birds)|gleans]] food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes [[hawking (birds)|hawks]] insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays are known to hide nuts for later consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2014/05/07/blue-jays-coming-hide-kids-hide-nuts/|title=The blue jays are coming!

The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are [[altricial]], and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name \"jay\" derives from its noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coues |first=Elliot |title=Key to North American birds |edition=5th |date=1890 |publisher=Estes and Lauriat |location=Boston, MA |oclc=469020022 |page=326}}</ref> It is sometimes called a \"jaybird\".<ref>{{cite web |title=jaybird \u2013 definition of jaybird by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jaybird |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe blue jay was first described as  ''Pica glandaria c\u00e6rulea cristata'' in [[England|English]] naturalist [[Mark Catesby]]'s 1731 publication of ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Catesby|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Catesby|title=Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas|edition=1st|date=1731|publisher=Royal Society House|location=[[London]]|page=87|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/dmisc/id/1658/show/1487}}</ref> It was later described as ''Corvus cristatus'' in [[Carl Linnaeus]]' 1758 edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Linnaeus|first=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

The western edge of the range stops where the [[arid]] pine forest and scrub [[habitat]] of the closely related [[Steller's jay]] (''C. stelleri'') begins, generally in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

It may withdraw several hundred kilometres south in the northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range. Young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.<ref name=eggeater/>\n\nThe blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the [[pine]] woods of Florida to[[spruce]]-[[fir]] Southern Alberta. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with [[oak]]s and [[beech]]es.<ref name=nero1991/> It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to Costco wholesale [[deforestation]] with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.<ref name=henninger1906/>\n\n==Subspecies==\nFour [[subspecies]] are generally accepted, though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]].

Virtually all the raptorial birds sympatric in distribution with the blue jay may prey upon it, especially swift bird-hunting specialists such as the ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks. Diverse predators may prey on jay eggs and young up to their fledging stage, including [[tree squirrel]]s, [[snake]]s, [[cat]]s, [[crow]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[opossum]]s, other jays and possibly many of the same birds of prey who attack adults.<ref name= ADW>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cyanocitta%20cristata.html|title=ADW: Cyanocitta cristata: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref>\n\nThe blue jay can be beneficial to other bird species, as it may chase [[predator]]y birds, such as [[hawk]]s and [[owl]]s, and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory. It has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near, and smaller birds often recognize this call and hide themselves away accordingly. It may occasionally impersonate the calls of raptors, especially those of the [[Red-tailed Hawk|red-tailed]] and [[red-shouldered hawk]]s, possibly to test if a hawk is in the vicinity, though also possibly to scare off other birds that may compete for food sources.<ref name=eggeater/> It may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest, and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the blue jay [[Mobbing behavior|mobs]] it until it takes a new roost.<ref name=oiseauxnet2008/> However, blue jays have also been known to attack or kill other smaller birds, and foliage-roosting bat species such as [[Eastern red bat]]s.<ref name=auk>{{cite web|title=Blue Jays Attack A Red Bat|url=https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/76/4/532/5224228}}</ref> Jays are very territorial birds, and they will chase others from a [[bird feeder|feeder]] for an easier meal. Additionally, the blue jay may raid other birds' nests, stealing eggs, chicks, and nests. However, this may not be as common as is typically thought, as only 1% of food matter in one study was bird material.<ref name=eggeater/> Despite this, other passerines may still mob jays who come within their breeding territories.\n\nWhen a blue jay is agitated or angry, the blue crest atop its head will rise.

In [[Florida]], blue jays were dominated at feeders by [[Eastern gray squirrel]]s, [[Florida scrub-jay]]s, [[common grackle]]s and [[red-headed woodpecker]]s, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.<ref name=eggeater/>\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Blue Jays nest.jpg|thumb|right|Nest in the top of a little pine]]\n[[File:Cyanocitta cristata MWNH 1384.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\nThe mating season begins in mid-March, peaks in mid-April to May, and extends into July. Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is preferred. The nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, with occasional mud added to the cup.\n\nBlue jays are not very picky about nesting locations. If no better place is available \u2013 e.g. in a heavily [[deforestation|deforested]] area \u2013 they will even use places like the large [[Letter box|mailboxes]] typical of the rural United States.<ref name=henninger1906/> They also appropriate nests of other mid-sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots; [[American robin]] nests are commonly used by blue jays, for example.\n[[File:Blue Jay Cyanocitta cristata Fledgling.jpg|thumb|left|Fledgling in mid-June]]\n[[File:Blue Jay fledgling head.JPG|thumb|Fledgling head]]\nBlue jays typically form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonds for life. Both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. There are usually between 3 and 6 (averaging 4 or 5) eggs laid and [[avian incubation|incubated]] over 16\u201318 days. The young [[fledge]] usually between 17\u201321 days after hatching.<ref name=oiseauxnet2008/>\n\nAfter the juveniles fledge, the family travels and forages together until early fall, when the young birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter. Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. Blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay was found to have been around 16\u201317, and a half years old.<ref>{{cite web |title=Longevity Records Of North American Birds |publisher=U.

However, despite several major local declines, overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease.<ref name=ADW/>\n\n==Vocalizations==\nBlue jays can make a large variety of sounds, and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other [[corvid]]s, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is.<ref name=George2003/> Their voice is typical of most [[jay]]s in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost [[gull]]-like scream. There is also a high-pitched ''jayer-jayer'' call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting ''chick-ah-dee-ee''. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to [[Mobbing behavior|mob]] potential predators such as [[hawk]]s and drive them away from the jays' nests.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename=Cyanocitta cristata - Blue Jay - XC86756.ogg\n| title=\"Rusty pump\" calls\n}}\n\nBlue jays also have quiet, almost subliminal calls which they use among themselves in proximity. One of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the \"rusty pump\" owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand-operated [[water pump]]. The blue jay (and other corvids) are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a song.\n\n==Cultural symbolism and interpretation==\nIn old [[African-American folktales|African American folklore]] of the southern United States, the blue jay was a significant metaphysical creature. In some tales the blue jay was credited with making the earth \"when all de worl' was water\" by bringing the first \"grit\" or \"dirt\". In other tales the blue jay was temporarily conscripted as a servant of the Devil to bring \"kindling\" to the \"bad place\": and \"was not encountered on a Friday as he was fetching sticks down to Hell; furthermore, he was so happy and chirpy on a Saturday as he was relieved to return from Hell\". <ref name=ingersoll23>{{cite book |last=Ingersoll |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Ingersoll |title=Birds in legend, fable and folklore |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co. |location=New York |date=1923 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge/page/166 166]\u2013167 |url=https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>\n\nThe blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team, as well as some of their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] affiliates. Their [[mascot]], [[Toronto Blue Jays mascots|Ace]], is an anthropomorphic blue jay. The blue jay is also the official mascot for [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Elmhurst College]], and [[Creighton University]]. The latter two spell the name as one word - Bluejay. It is also the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada.\n\nIn the 1966 Western film ''[[The Shooting]]'', the blue jay is cited as a sign of good luck.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=CLO>[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Blue_Jay_dtl.html Blue Jay, Life History, All About Birds - Cornell Lab of Ornithology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<ref name=Frysinger>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cyanocitta_cristata.html|title=ADW: Cyanocitta cristata: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref><!-- there is some more information here e.g. on predators and status -->\n\n<ref name=George2003>George, Philip Brandt.

It resides through most of eastern and central United States, although western populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also found in Newfoundland, Canada, while breeding populations can be found across southern Canada. It breeds in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests, and is common in residential areas. It is predominantly blue with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies of the blue jay have been recognized.\n\nThe blue jay mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as [[acorn]]s, soft fruits, [[arthropods]], and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically [[gleaning (birds)|gleans]] food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes [[hawking (birds)|hawks]] insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays are known to hide nuts for later consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2014/05/07/blue-jays-coming-hide-kids-hide-nuts/|title=The blue jays are coming!

The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are [[altricial]], and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name \"jay\" derives from its noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coues |first=Elliot |title=Key to North American birds |edition=5th |date=1890 |publisher=Estes and Lauriat |location=Boston, MA |oclc=469020022 |page=326}}</ref> It is sometimes called a \"jaybird\".<ref>{{cite web |title=jaybird \u2013 definition of jaybird by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jaybird |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe blue jay was first described as  ''Pica glandaria c\u00e6rulea cristata'' in [[England|English]] naturalist [[Mark Catesby]]'s 1731 publication of ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Catesby|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Catesby|title=Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas|edition=1st|date=1731|publisher=Royal Society House|location=[[London]]|page=87|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/dmisc/id/1658/show/1487}}</ref> It was later described as ''Corvus cristatus'' in [[Carl Linnaeus]]' 1758 edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Linnaeus|first=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

It may withdraw several hundred kilometres south in the northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range. Young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.<ref name=eggeater/>\n\nThe blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the [[pine]] woods of Florida to the [[spruce]]-[[fir]] forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with [[oak]]s and [[beech]]es.<ref name=nero1991/> It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale [[deforestation]] with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.<ref name=henninger1906/>\n\n==Subspecies==\nFour [[subspecies]] are generally accepted, though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]].

Diverse predators may prey on jay eggs and young up to their fledging stage, including [[tree squirrel]]s, [[snake]]s, [[cat]]s, [[crow]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[opossum]]s, other jays and possibly many of the same birds of prey who attack adults.<ref name= ADW>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cyanocitta%20cristata.html|title=ADW: Cyanocitta cristata: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref>\n\nThe blue jay can be beneficial to other bird species, as it may chase [[predator]]y birds, such as [[hawk]]s and [[owl]]s, and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory. It has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near, and smaller birds often recognize this call and hide themselves away accordingly. It may occasionally impersonate the calls of raptors, especially those of the [[Red-tailed Hawk|red-tailed]] and [[red-shouldered hawk]]s, possibly to test if a hawk is in the vicinity, though also possibly to scare off other birds that may compete for food sources.<ref name=eggeater/> It may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest, and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the blue jay [[Mobbing behavior|mobs]] it until it takes a new roost.<ref name=oiseauxnet2008/> However, blue jays have also been known to attack or kill other smaller birds, and foliage-roosting bat species such as [[Eastern red bat]]s.<ref name=auk>{{cite web|title=Blue Jays Attack A Red Bat|url=https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/76/4/532/5224228}}</ref> Jays are very territorial birds, and they will chase others from a [[bird feeder|feeder]] for an easier meal. Additionally, the blue jay may raid other birds' nests, stealing eggs, chicks, and nests. However, this may not be as common as is typically thought, as only 1% of food matter in one study was bird material.<ref name=eggeater/> Despite this, other passerines may still mob jays who come within their breeding territories.\n\nWhen a blue jay is agitated or angry, the blue crest atop its head will rise.

In [[Florida]], blue jays were dominated at feeders by [[Eastern gray squirrel]]s, [[Florida scrub-jay]]s, [[common grackle]]s and [[red-headed woodpecker]]s, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.<ref name=eggeater/>\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Blue Jays nest.jpg|thumb|right|Nest in the top of a little pine]]\n[[File:Cyanocitta cristata MWNH 1384.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\nThe mating season begins in mid-March, peaks in mid-April to May, and extends into July. Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is preferred. The nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, with occasional mud added to the cup.\n\nBlue jays are not very picky about nesting locations. If no better place is available \u2013 e.g. in a heavily [[deforestation|deforested]] area \u2013 they will even use places like the large [[Letter box|mailboxes]] typical of the rural United States.<ref name=henninger1906/> They also appropriate nests of other mid-sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots; [[American robin]] nests are commonly used by blue jays, for example.\n[[File:Blue Jay Cyanocitta cristata Fledgling.jpg|thumb|left|Fledgling in mid-June]]\n[[File:Blue Jay fledgling head.JPG|thumb|Fledgling head]]\nBlue jays typically form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonds for life. Both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. There are usually between 3 and 6 (averaging 4 or 5) eggs laid and [[avian incubation|incubated]] over 16\u201318 days. The young [[fledge]] usually between 17\u201321 days after hatching.<ref name=oiseauxnet2008/>\n\nAfter the juveniles fledge, the family travels and forages together until early fall, when the young birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter. Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. Blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay was found to have been around 16\u201317, and a half years old.<ref>{{cite web |title=Longevity Records Of North American Birds |publisher=U.

However, despite several major local declines, overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease.<ref name=ADW/>\n\n==Vocalizations==\nBlue jays can make a large variety of sounds, and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other [[corvid]]s, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is.<ref name=George2003/> Their voice is typical of most [[jay]]s in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost [[gull]]-like scream. There is also a high-pitched ''jayer-jayer'' call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting ''chick-ah-dee-ee''. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to [[Mobbing behavior|mob]] potential predators such as [[hawk]]s and drive them away from the jays' nests.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename=Cyanocitta cristata - Blue Jay - XC86756.ogg\n| title=\"Rusty pump\" calls\n}}\n\nBlue jays also have quiet, almost subliminal calls which they use among themselves in proximity. One of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the \"rusty pump\" owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand-operated [[water pump]]. The blue jay (and other corvids) are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a song.\n\n==Cultural symbolism and interpretation==\nIn old [[African-American folktales|African American folklore]] of the southern United States, the blue jay was a significant metaphysical creature. In some tales the blue jay was credited with making the earth \"when all de worl' was water\" by bringing the first \"grit\" or \"dirt\". In other tales the blue jay was temporarily conscripted as a servant of the Devil to bring \"kindling\" to the \"bad place\": and \"was not encountered on a Friday as he was fetching sticks down to Hell; furthermore, he was so happy and chirpy on a Saturday as he was relieved to return from Hell\". <ref name=ingersoll23>{{cite book |last=Ingersoll |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Ingersoll |title=Birds in legend, fable and folklore |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co. |location=New York |date=1923 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge/page/166 166]\u2013167 |url=https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>\n\nThe blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team, as well as some of their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] affiliates. Their [[mascot]], [[Toronto Blue Jays mascots|Ace]], is an anthropomorphic blue jay. The blue jay is also the official mascot for [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Elmhurst College]], and [[Creighton University]]. The latter two spell the name as one word - Bluejay. It is also the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada.\n\nIn the 1966 Western film ''[[The Shooting]]'', the blue jay is cited as a sign of good luck.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=CLO>[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Blue_Jay_dtl.html Blue Jay, Life History, All About Birds - Cornell Lab of Ornithology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<ref name=Frysinger>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cyanocitta_cristata.html|title=ADW: Cyanocitta cristata: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref><!-- there is some more information here e.g. on predators and status -->\n\n<ref name=George2003>George, Philip Brandt.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a foil equal to [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role, because he had the charisma, charm and athleticism they felt was needed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further. Hutchison said that while he is just as \"scary\" as the other Salamancas, he is \"a little more circumspect about things.\" She explained that the producers wanted him to be \"a little charming\", in contrast to the other Salamancas, and \"There isn't something about them where you're like, \"Oh, he's scary, but he's kinda funny, too!\" We really liked the idea of having a Salamanca who's charming\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |title='Better Call Saul' Writer Breaks Down the \"Wiedersehen\" Rooftop Fight and That Famous Bell |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |date=October 1, 2018 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081655/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Additional characterization was given in the season five finale \"[[Something Unforgivable]]\", which provided breadth of development not seen in prior episodes, according to Dalton. The episode shows Lalo early on as a charismatic person welcomed by his extended family and the leaders of the cartel, but later showing an evil and vengeful side after his family comes under attack.<ref name=\"variety dalton\"/>\n\nGilligan and Gould gave Dalton the freedom to take Lalo's personality as he saw fit, in the same manner they had allowed [[Jonathan Banks]] to develop [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] during ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-tony-dalton-lalo.html | title = Better Call Saul\u2019s Tony Dalton Hopes That Lalo Gets a \u2018Worthy Death\u2019 | first = Maria Elena | last = Fernandez | date = April 20, 2020 | accessdate = April 21, 2020 | work = [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] }}</ref> According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming: \"I saw ''Breaking Bad'' and I saw ''Better Call Saul'' before I got the job, and I thought there needs to be somebody besides [[Bob Odenkirk|Bob [Odenkirk]]], [...] who is also kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous in the bad guy's part\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> Dalton took inspiration from [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s character Jules Winnfield from ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' for acting as Lalo, \"Kind of this smart ass, sort of scary but kind of carefree, kind of cool guy\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> He also sought to differentiate Lalo from his hitman role in the [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO Latinoam\u00e9rica]] series ''[[Sr. \u00c1vila]]'', saying that the latter \"had zero personality. If he was standing against a wall, you couldn\u2019t tell him apart from the wall.\" Dalton avoided giving him a thick Mexican accent because \"he\u2019s kind of a second generation narco. He might have gone to a good school in Texas or Arizona or something because his family had money.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Segal |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/arts/television/tony-dalton-better-call-saul-finale.html |title=Tony Dalton Talks \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019: Sympathy for el Diablo |date=April 20, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 21, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.is/WHLsS |archive-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> Dalton further distanced his character from the typical portrayal of cartel members in past works, who typically are presented as serious about their work, and instead took on a more upbeat personality to show Lalo's normally easy take on life.

While Dalton was eager to do other stunts as Lalo, such as jumping onto Jimmy's car in \"[[Bad Choice Road]]\" and from the roof of his house in \"Something Unforgivable\", the producers insisted these be done by stuntmen.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\"/>\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nEduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca is a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] and one of many nephews of drug kingpin Hector Salamanca.

Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair, enabling him to communicate more effectively with his right index finger, the only body part Hector can move after he emerges from his coma.

Mike stops at a money wire store and reviews security footage showing Werner looking at travel brochures, as Lalo watches from outside. Mike guesses Werner is going to a nearby spa to meet his wife and asks Gus to allow him to persuade Werner to return rather than killing him. After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred and reviews the footage himself, burns the store as he leaves, then begins calling travel resorts to track down Werner.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a foil equal to [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role, because he had the charisma, charm and athleticism they felt was needed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}}\n\nThis attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nIn the breakout scenario, the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the attack helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nIn the breakout scenario, the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the attack helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft.
