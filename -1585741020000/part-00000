[[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and western parts of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], being closest to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], are generally the mildest, wettest and windiest regions of the UK, and [[Atmospheric temperature|temperature ranges]] here are seldom extreme. Eastern areas are drier, cooler, and less windy, and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Northern areas are generally cooler and wetter, and have slightly larger temperature ranges than southern areas.\n\nThe UK is mostly under the influence of the maritime polar [[air mass]] from the north-west. Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland are the most exposed to the maritime polar air mass which brings cool moist air; the east of Scotland and north-east England are more exposed to the continental polar air mass which brings cold dry air. The south and south-east of England are the least exposed to polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see continental tropical air masses from the south, which bring warm dry air in the summer. On average, the temperature ranges from {{convert|18| to |25|C}}.\n\nIf the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including its islands) and the south-east of England \u2013 often a difference of 10-15 \u00b0C (18-27 \u00b0F) but sometimes as much as 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles can have temperatures around {{convert|15|C}}, while the areas around London reach {{convert|36|C}}.\n\n==England==\n[[File:England K\u00f6ppen.png|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in England]]\n\nEngland generally has higher maximum and minimum temperatures than the other areas of the UK, though Wales has higher minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has higher maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, with an average of 193.5 hours. It rains on fewer days in every month throughout the year than the rest of the UK, and rainfall totals are less in every month, with the driest month, May, averaging {{convert|58.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"England\" /> The [[climate of south-west England]] displays a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom. Gales are less common in England compared to Scotland; however on some occasions there can be strong winds, and rarely, the remains of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Some events such as the [[Great Storm of 1987]] occurred near to the UK and caused damage in England.\nThe prevailing wind direction for England is from the south-west.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Spring is generally a calm, cool season, particularly because the Atlantic has lost much of its heat throughout the autumn and winter. As the sun rises higher in the sky and the days get longer, temperatures slowly rise, but the solar effect is mitigated somewhat by the effect of the cool ocean waters and westerly winds that blow across them.\n\nThere is a fair chance of snow earlier in the season when temperatures are colder; often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years have happened in the first half of March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.\n\nEarly spring can be quite cold, and occasionally the lowest temperature of the winter can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even in the south of the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above {{convert|30|C}} are generally rare, but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when {{convert|31.9|C}} was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 in most parts of the UK. In [[Aberdaron]], the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach {{convert|20|C}}, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be large temperature swings between day and night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just {{convert|3|C}} at Northolt, but {{convert|25|C}} was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.\n\nMean temperatures in Spring are markedly influenced by latitude.

This can combine with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, to produce some unsettled weather. In addition, the land may become colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of [[condensation]] and rain-bearing clouds.\n\nAtlantic depressions at this time can become intense, and winds of [[hurricane]] force (greater than {{convert|119|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) can be recorded. Western areas, closest to the Atlantic, experience these severe conditions more often than eastern areas. Autumn, particularly the latter part, is often the stormiest time of the year. One particularly intense depression was the [[Great Storm of 1987]]. A very severe storm also affected the UK on 27 October 2002. At Mumbles Head near Swansea, a maximum sustained wind speed of over 123&nbsp;km/h was recorded: equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/10-2002/ws-36090.html|title=Climate MUMBLES (October 2002) - Climate data (36090)|first=Tutiempo Network|last=S.L|website=www.tutiempo.net}}</ref> The autumn of 2013 was also littered with severe storms, including the St. Jude's Storm on 28 October 2013.\n\nAutumn can sometimes be a cold season - in recent years, very low temperatures and heavy snowfall have been recorded during November 1985, November 1993 and November 2010. There was a new record low of {{convert|-18.0|C}} in Wales on 28 November 2010. At Northolt, in Greater London, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November.

Even further south, low temperatures can be recorded, with temperatures well below freezing as far south as Heathrow Airport on 29\u201331 October 1997, with a lower temperature than any recorded at this station in March, November or December 1997 and even the following January 1998; only on 2 and 4 February 1998 were lower temperatures recorded here that winter. The first frost of the winter usually occurs between October and December; frost is quite unusual in September, when the surrounding ocean is at or near its warmest, except on high ground.

The season is generally cool, wet, windy, and cloudy. Temperatures at night rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C}} and in the day rarely rise above {{convert|15|C|F|0}}. Precipitation can be plentiful throughout the season, though snow is relatively infrequent despite the country's high latitude: often the only areas with significant snowfall are the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Pennines]], where at higher elevations a colder climate determines the vegetation, mainly temperate coniferous forest, although deforestation has severely decreased the forest area. For a majority of the UK, snow is frequent in winter time yet is usually light and doesn't last long, apart from the higher altitudes, where snow can lie for 1\u20135 months or even beyond 6 months.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/snow/snow-in-the-uk</ref>\n\nTowards the later part of the season the weather usually stabilises with less wind, less precipitation and lower temperatures. This change is particularly pronounced near the coasts, mainly because the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is often at its coldest at this time after being cooled throughout the autumn and the winter. The early part of winter however is often unsettled and stormy; often the wettest and windiest time of the year.\n\n[[File:Saddle and sgurr na sgine 06-07 086.jpg|thumb|left|Snow cover on [[The Saddle]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nSnow falls intermittently and mainly affects northern and eastern areas, high ground in Wales and especially the mountains of [[Scotland]], where there is often enough snow lying to permit [[skiing]] at some of the five [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Scotland|Scottish ski resorts]]. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of \"[[polar low]]s\", introducing heavy snow and often [[blizzard]]-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003. During periods of light winds and high pressure, [[frost]] and [[fog]] can become a problem and can pose a major hazard to drivers.\n\nMean winter temperatures in the UK are most influenced by proximity to the sea.

The UK can suffer extreme winters like 1684, 1740, 1795 (when London had its record lowest temperature of {{convert|-21.1|C|F|1}}, 1947 and 1963. In 1962 it snowed on [[Boxing Day]], and snow lasted in most areas until 6 March, with blizzards through February, which had significant and documented effects on the [[FA Cup]] - Wrexham were forced to play on sand for one tie. In recent times snow has generally become rarer, but the UK can still get heavy falls, such as in 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382, [[January 1987 South-East England snowfall|1986-87]] and [[Winter of 1990\u20131991 in Western Europe|1990-91]]. The [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|winter of 2008/09]] produced the heaviest snowfall since 1991 between 1 and 3 February, and the [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|winter of 2009-10]] was even more severe, with many parts of the United Kingdom having the coldest and snowiest winters since 1978/79; temperatures plummeted to {{convert|-22.3|C}} at [[Altnaharra]], Sutherland \u2013 close to the {{convert|-22.9|C}} recorded in Antarctica in the same period. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK was {{convert|-27.2|C}}, on 10 January 1982 and 11 February 1895 in [[Braemar]], Scotland and on 30 December 1995 in Altnaharra. December 2010 was the coldest December in 120 years; the CET (Central England Temperature) was {{convert|-0.7|C}}; it was the coldest month since February 1986, and the coldest December since 1890. Many places had heavy snowfall and extreme cold, temperatures regularly fell below {{convert|-10.0|C|F|1}} across many areas. However, the cold subsided after Christmas Day, 2010. November 2010 saw an extremely severe cold snap, with lows of {{convert|-18.0|C|F|1}} in Llysdinam on 28 November. The month saw temperatures below average, despite what was actually a very mild first half. Spring 2013 was also cold: March 2013 was the coldest month of the winter (and indeed 2013 as a whole), which is quite striking given that December 2012, January and February 2013 were all also below average in terms of temperature. The following winter was the opposite: in many places, only on 11 and 12 January was any snow recorded (some places having no snow at all), and the entire country was battered by a series of severe depressions and storms. The St Jude's Day storm first affected the UK on 26 October 2013, and many places saw no respite until a [[high pressure|high]] swept across the country on 2 March 2014. Some places in the [[Somerset Levels]] remained under water for most of the winter and well into spring. Record-equalling gusts of 142&nbsp;mph were recorded off the north coast of Scotland on 5 December 2013, with notably severe storms also recorded on 2 November 2013, 24 December 2013, 3 January 2014 and 14 February 2014.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, most of the winters were milder and usually wetter than average, with below-freezing daytime temperatures a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 was the only one which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall and January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11, however, had below or well below average temperatures, with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; this was the first series of three consecutive cold winters in the UK since the 1960s. The winter of 2012/13 was very cold too, although the peak of the cold was in March.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/case-studies/widespread-snow-march-2013</ref> The winter of 2014/2015 was an oddity: it was generally quiet and sunny. December 2014 and January 2015 were a little milder than the average; February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 was cool and January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average daily minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010. The winter of 2017/18 was then much colder than average too. However, mild temperatures prevailed during winter 2018/19.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/anomacts</ref>\n\nDecember 2015 was the wettest calendar month ever recorded in the United Kingdom, and January 2016 the second wettest.

This [[thermohaline circulation]] has a powerful moderating and warming effect on the country's climate. This warm water current warms the climate to such a great extent that if the current did not exist then temperatures in winter would be about {{convert|10|C-change}} lower than they are today and similar to eastern Russia or Canada near the same latitude. The current allows England to have [[vineyard]]s at the same latitude that [[Canada]] has [[polar bear]]s. These warm [[ocean current]]s also bring substantial amounts of [[humidity]] which contributes to the notoriously wet climate that western parts of the UK experience.\n\n==Winds==\n{{further|List of atmospheric pressure records in Europe}}\nThe high latitude and proximity to a large ocean to the west means that the United Kingdom experiences strong winds. The prevailing wind is from the south-west, but it may blow from any direction for sustained periods of time. Winds are strongest near westerly facing coasts and exposed [[headland]]s.\n\n[[Gale]]s &mdash; which are defined as winds with speeds of {{convert|51|to|101|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}&mdash; are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the country. The [[Hebrides]] experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds) while inland areas in England and Wales receive fewer than 5 days of gale a year.<ref name=\"Englandclimate\" /> Areas of high [[elevation]] tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations, and [[Great Dun Fell]] in [[Cumbria]] (at {{convert|857|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) averaged 114 days of gale a year during the period 1963 to 1976.

In Scotland, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire recorded {{convert|142|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} on 13 February 1989, which was equalled during Cyclone Xaver on 5 December 2013. Wales' highest wind speed gust of {{convert|124|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} was set at Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan on 28 October 1989. Especially potent storm systems typically affect the UK during autumn and winter, with the winters of 1989/1990 and 2013/2014 particularly notable for the frequency and potency of storm systems.\n\nAn unofficial gust of 194&nbsp;mph was recorded in the Shetland Isles during the [[New Year's Day Storm]] on 1 January 1992, and an equal unofficial 194&nbsp;mph wind gust is claimed to have been set in the Cairngorm Mountains on 19 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/4141762/Highlands-mountain-claims-strongest-UK-wind.html|title=Highlands mountain claims strongest UK wind|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=25 June 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nBarometric pressure plays a role in storm systems.

During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The [[last glacial period]] was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted for tens of thousands of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great [[ice sheet]] extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of [[England]] (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of [[Wales]].\n\nThe cold period from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries is known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nThe temperature records in England are continuous back to the mid 17th century. The [[Central England temperature]] (CET) record is the oldest in the world, and is a compound source of cross-correlated records from several locations in central England. Precipitation records date back to the eighteenth century and the modern [[England and Wales Precipitation]] series begins in 1766.\n\nA detailed narrative account of the weather of every year from 1913 to 1942, with photographs of plants taken on the same day in each of those years, may be found in Willis (1944).<ref>Willis, J. H., (1944) ''Weatherwise'', London, George Allen and Unwin.</ref>\n\nAs with many parts of the world, over the last century the United Kingdom has reported a warming trend in temperatures. While some of this may be due to a recovery from the cooler period of climate mid 20th century (particularly the 1960s) the last 20 years has nonetheless seen an unprecedented level of warm weather. In July 2019, [[BBC]] reported that records from the [[Met Office]] show that the 10 warmest years in the UK have occurred since 2002, with 2014 being the warmest. In the same period, the coolest year has been 2010; however, this still only ranks 22nd on the overall list of coolest years on record.<ref>{{Cite

Since the UK is always in or close to the path of the polar front [[jet stream]], frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK is cool and often cloudy and rainy, and high temperatures are infrequent. \n\nThe climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]], or ''Cfb'' on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, a classification it shares with most of north-west Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Peel, M.

[[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and western parts of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], being closest to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], are generally the mildest, wettest and windiest regions of the UK, and [[Atmospheric temperature|temperature ranges]] here are seldom extreme. Eastern areas are drier, cooler, and less windy, and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Northern areas are generally cooler and wetter, and have slightly larger temperature ranges than southern areas.\n\nThe UK is mostly under the influence of the maritime polar [[air mass]] from the north-west. Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland are the most exposed to the maritime polar air mass which brings cool moist air; the east of Scotland and north-east England are more exposed to the continental polar air mass which brings cold dry air. The south and south-east of England are the least exposed to polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see continental tropical air masses from the south, which bring warm dry air in the summer. On average, the temperature ranges from {{convert|18| to |25|C}}.\n\nIf the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including its islands) and the south-east of England \u2013 often a difference of 10-15 \u00b0C (18-27 \u00b0F) but sometimes as much as 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles can have temperatures around {{convert|15|C}}, while the areas around London reach {{convert|36|C}}.\n\n==England==\n[[File:England K\u00f6ppen.png|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in England]]\n\nEngland generally has higher maximum and minimum temperatures than the other areas of the UK, though Wales has higher minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has higher maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, with an average of 193.5 hours. It rains on fewer days in every month throughout the year than the rest of the UK, and rainfall totals are less in every month, with the driest month, May, averaging {{convert|58.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"England\" /> The [[climate of south-west England]] displays a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom. Gales are less common in England compared to Scotland; however on some occasions there can be strong winds, and rarely, the remains of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Some events such as the [[Great Storm of 1987]] occurred near to the UK and caused damage in England.\nThe prevailing wind direction for England is from the south-west.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Spring is generally a calm, cool season, particularly because the Atlantic has lost much of its heat throughout the autumn and winter. As the sun rises higher in the sky and the days get longer, temperatures slowly rise, but the solar effect is mitigated somewhat by the effect of the cool ocean waters and westerly winds that blow across them.\n\nThere is a fair chance of snow earlier in the season when temperatures are colder; often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years have happened in the first half of March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.\n\nEarly spring can be quite cold, and occasionally the lowest temperature of the winter can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even in the south of the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above {{convert|30|C}} are generally rare, but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when {{convert|31.9|C}} was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 in most parts of the UK. In [[Aberdaron]], the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach {{convert|20|C}}, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be large temperature swings between day and night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just {{convert|3|C}} at Northolt, but {{convert|25|C}} was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.\n\nMean temperatures in Spring are markedly influenced by latitude. Most of Scotland and the mountains of Wales and northern England are the coolest areas of the UK, with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|-0.6|to|5.8|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"spring\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/13.gif | title = Mean Temperature Spring Average | accessdate = 14 August 2007 | publisher = Met Office | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030548/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/13.gif | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The southern half of England experiences the warmest spring temperatures of between {{convert|8.8|and|10.3|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"spring\" />\n\n===Summer===\nSummer lasts from June to August and is the warmest and usually the sunniest season.

This can combine with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, to produce some unsettled weather. In addition, the land may become colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of [[condensation]] and rain-bearing clouds.\n\nAtlantic depressions at this time can become intense, and winds of [[hurricane]] force (greater than {{convert|119|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) can be recorded. Western areas, closest to the Atlantic, experience these severe conditions more often than eastern areas. Autumn, particularly the latter part, is often the stormiest time of the year. One particularly intense depression was the [[Great Storm of 1987]]. A very severe storm also affected the UK on 27 October 2002. At Mumbles Head near Swansea, a maximum sustained wind speed of over 123&nbsp;km/h was recorded: equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/10-2002/ws-36090.html|title=Climate MUMBLES (October 2002) - Climate data (36090)|first=Tutiempo Network|last=S.L|website=www.tutiempo.net}}</ref> The autumn of 2013 was also littered with severe storms, including the St. Jude's Storm on 28 October 2013.\n\nAutumn can sometimes be a cold season - in recent years, very low temperatures and heavy snowfall have been recorded during November 1985, November 1993 and November 2010. There was a new record low of {{convert|-18.0|C}} in Wales on 28 November 2010. At Northolt, in Greater London, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November. Snow also fell rather widely across the UK on 28\u201329 October 2008, causing traffic problems where it settled on the M4. Even further south, low temperatures can be recorded, with temperatures well below freezing as far south as Heathrow Airport on 29\u201331 October 1997, with a lower temperature than any recorded at this station in March, November or December 1997 and even the following January 1998; only on 2 and 4 February 1998 were lower temperatures recorded here that winter. The first frost of the winter usually occurs between October and December; frost is quite unusual in September, when the surrounding ocean is at or near its warmest, except on high ground. It is not particularly unusual for September to be warmer than June, as it was in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-weather.eu/article.138.html|title=London Weather - 1999 Mild, rather wet, and very thundery.|author=|date=|website=www.london-weather.eu}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the United Kingdom sometimes experiences an \"Indian summer\", when temperatures, particularly by night, can be very mild and rarely fall below {{convert|10|C|F|0}}. Such events are aided by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean and seas being at their warmest, keeping the country in warm air, despite the relatively weak sun. Examples of this were in 1985, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2011<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/03/uk-weather-normal-record-heatwave?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sam | last=Jones | title=UK weather returns to normal after record-breaking heatwave | date=3 October 2011}}</ref> and 2016 when September saw above average temperatures which felt more like a continuation of summer than autumn. Autumns since 2000 have generally been very mild, with notable extremes of precipitation; the UK has seen some of its wettest and driest autumns since the millennium. 2011 and 2016 were notable as many areas of the country recorded their highest temperatures of the year in September and October (for example, {{convert|28.2|C}} at Hawarden on 1 October, {{convert|26.3|C}} at St. Athan on 2 October 2011 and the UK's highest temperature of 2016 on 13 September with {{convert|34.4|C}} at Gravesend).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/13/uks-hottest-september-day-since-1949-32c-heathrow|title=UK's hottest September day in 105 years sets 2016 record|first=Damien|last=Gayle|date=13 September 2016|website=the Guardian}}</ref> On 13 October 2018, temperatures reached {{convert|26.5|C}} at Donna Nook in Lincolnshire, the latest in the year such a high temperature had been recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/16-degree-swing-saw-go-2109033|title=From UK's hottest place to a taste of winter in just 24 hours|date=15 October 2018|publisher=Grimsby Telegraph}}</ref> Temperatures on the night of 12\u201313 October were also just under {{convert|20|C}} in London.\n\nCoastal areas in the southern half of England have on average the warmest autumns, with mean temperatures of {{convert|10.7|to|13.0|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"autumn\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/15.gif | title = Mean Temperature Autumn Average | accessdate = 14 August 2007 | publisher = Met Office | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030823/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/15.gif | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Mountainous areas of Wales and northern England, and almost all of Scotland, experience mean temperatures between {{convert|1.7|and|7.5|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"autumn\" />\n[[File:UK zonemap.png|thumb|upright|[[Hardiness zone]]s in the [[British Isles]]. Based on the [[USDA]] system and used to indicate growing conditions for plants.]]\n\n===Winter===\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2018}}\nWinter in the [[UK]] is defined as lasting from December to February. The season is generally cool, wet, windy, and cloudy. Temperatures at night rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C}} and in the day rarely rise above {{convert|15|C|F|0}}. Precipitation can be plentiful throughout the season, though snow is relatively infrequent despite the country's high latitude: often the only areas with significant snowfall are the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Pennines]], where at higher elevations a colder climate determines the vegetation, mainly temperate coniferous forest, although deforestation has severely decreased the forest area. For a majority of the UK, snow is frequent in winter time yet is usually light and doesn't last long, apart from the higher altitudes, where snow can lie for 1\u20135 months or even beyond 6 months.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/snow/snow-in-the-uk</ref>\n\nTowards the later part of the season the weather usually stabilises with less wind, less precipitation and lower temperatures. This change is particularly pronounced near the coasts, mainly because the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is often at its coldest at this time after being cooled throughout the autumn and the winter. The early part of winter however is often unsettled and stormy; often the wettest and windiest time of the year.\n\n[[File:Saddle and sgurr na sgine 06-07 086.jpg|thumb|left|Snow cover on [[The Saddle]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nSnow falls intermittently and mainly affects northern and eastern areas, high ground in Wales and especially the mountains of [[Scotland]], where there is often enough snow lying to permit [[skiing]] at some of the five [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Scotland|Scottish ski resorts]]. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of \"[[polar low]]s\", introducing heavy snow and often [[blizzard]]-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003.

The UK can suffer extreme winters like 1684, 1740, 1795 (when London had its record lowest temperature of {{convert|-21.1|C|F|1}}, 1947 and 1963. In 1962 it snowed on [[Boxing Day]], and snow lasted in most areas until 6 March, with blizzards through February, which had significant and documented effects on the [[FA Cup]] - Wrexham were forced to play on sand for one tie. In recent times snow has generally become rarer, but the UK can still get heavy falls, such as in 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382, [[January 1987 South-East England snowfall|1986-87]] and [[Winter of 1990\u20131991 in Western Europe|1990-91]]. The [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|winter of 2008/09]] produced the heaviest snowfall since 1991 between 1 and 3 February, and the [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|winter of 2009-10]] was even more severe, with many parts of the United Kingdom having the coldest and snowiest winters since 1978/79; temperatures plummeted to {{convert|-22.3|C}} at [[Altnaharra]], Sutherland \u2013 close to the {{convert|-22.9|C}} recorded in Antarctica in the same period. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK was {{convert|-27.2|C}}, on 10 January 1982 and 11 February 1895 in [[Braemar]], Scotland and on 30 December 1995 in Altnaharra. December 2010 was the coldest December in 120 years; the CET (Central England Temperature) was {{convert|-0.7|C}}; it was the coldest month since February 1986, and the coldest December since 1890. Many places had heavy snowfall and extreme cold, temperatures regularly fell below {{convert|-10.0|C|F|1}} across many areas. However, the cold subsided after Christmas Day, 2010. November 2010 saw an extremely severe cold snap, with lows of {{convert|-18.0|C|F|1}} in Llysdinam on 28 November. The month saw temperatures below average, despite what was actually a very mild first half. Spring 2013 was also cold: March 2013 was the coldest month of the winter (and indeed 2013 as a whole), which is quite striking given that December 2012, January and February 2013 were all also below average in terms of temperature. The following winter was the opposite: in many places, only on 11 and 12 January was any snow recorded (some places having no snow at all), and the entire country was battered by a series of severe depressions and storms. The St Jude's Day storm first affected the UK on 26 October 2013, and many places saw no respite until a [[high pressure|high]] swept across the country on 2 March 2014. Some places in the [[Somerset Levels]] remained under water for most of the winter and well into spring. Record-equalling gusts of 142&nbsp;mph were recorded off the north coast of Scotland on 5 December 2013, with notably severe storms also recorded on 2 November 2013, 24 December 2013, 3 January 2014 and 14 February 2014.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, most of the winters were milder and usually wetter than average, with below-freezing daytime temperatures a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 was the only one which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall and January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11, however, had below or well below average temperatures, with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; this was the first series of three consecutive cold winters in the UK since the 1960s.

December 2014 and January 2015 were a little milder than the average; February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 was cool and January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average daily minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010. The winter of 2017/18 was then much colder than average too.

This [[thermohaline circulation]] has a powerful moderating and warming effect on the country's climate. This warm water current warms the climate to such a great extent that if the current did not exist then temperatures in winter would be about {{convert|10|C-change}} lower than they are today and similar to eastern Russia or Canada near the same latitude. The current allows England to have [[vineyard]]s at the same latitude that [[Canada]] has [[polar bear]]s. These warm [[ocean current]]s also bring substantial amounts of [[humidity]] which contributes to the notoriously wet climate that western parts of the UK experience.\n\n==Winds==\n{{further|List of atmospheric pressure records in Europe}}\nThe high latitude and proximity to a large ocean to the west means that the United Kingdom experiences strong winds. The prevailing wind is from the south-west, but it may blow from any direction for sustained periods of time. Winds are strongest near westerly facing coasts and exposed [[headland]]s.\n\n[[Gale]]s &mdash; which are defined as winds with speeds of {{convert|51|to|101|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}&mdash; are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the country. The [[Hebrides]] experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds) while inland areas in England and Wales receive fewer than 5 days of gale a year.<ref name=\"Englandclimate\" /> Areas of high [[elevation]] tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations, and [[Great Dun Fell]] in [[Cumbria]] (at {{convert|857|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) averaged 114 days of gale a year during the period 1963 to 1976. The highest [[wind|gust]] recorded at a low level in England was {{convert|191|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} at [[Gwennap Head]] in [[Cornwall]] on 15 December 1979,<ref name=\"Englandclimate\" /> and a 115&nbsp;mph gust was also recorded at Shoreham-By-Sea on 16 October 1987.

In Scotland, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire recorded {{convert|142|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} on 13 February 1989, which was equalled during Cyclone Xaver on 5 December 2013. Wales' highest wind speed gust of {{convert|124|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} was set at Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan on 28 October 1989. Especially potent storm systems typically affect the UK during autumn and winter, with the winters of 1989/1990 and 2013/2014 particularly notable for the frequency and potency of storm systems.\n\nAn unofficial gust of 194&nbsp;mph was recorded in the Shetland Isles during the [[New Year's Day Storm]] on 1 January 1992, and an equal unofficial 194&nbsp;mph wind gust is claimed to have been set in the Cairngorm Mountains on 19 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/4141762/Highlands-mountain-claims-strongest-UK-wind.html|title=Highlands mountain claims strongest UK wind|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=25 June 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nBarometric pressure plays a role in storm systems.

Both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury. The largest ever recorded was thought to have been an F4, again in [[London tornado of 1091|London in 1091]]. The most deadly occurred on 28 December 1879. All 74 lives were lost when a passenger train plunged from the Tay Bridge (Tayside) into the Tay Estuary, when the middle section of the bridge collapsed. Although the bridge was poorly constructed and had already been weakened in earlier gales (including the pre-existing winds at the time of the tragedy), the ultimate failure is believed to have been caused by two or three waterspouts which were sighted close to the bridge immediately before the accident.<ref name=\"torro.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.torro.org.uk/site/whirlwind_info.php|title=TORRO - British & European Tornado Extremes|author=|date=|website=www.torro.org.uk}}</ref> A tornado also developed in London on 3 July 2007.\n\n[[File:Nintchdbpict000003669438.jpg|thumb|Birmingham tornado July 2005]]\nThe UK also holds the title for the highest known 'outbreak' of tornadoes outside of the United States.  The largest tornado outbreak in Britain is also the largest tornado outbreak known anywhere in Europe. On 23 November 1981, 105 tornadoes were spawned by a cold front in the space of 5.25 hours. Excepting Derbyshire, every county in a triangular area from Gwynedd to Humberside to Essex was hit by at least one tornado, while Norfolk was hit by at least 13. Very fortunately most tornadoes were short-lived and also weak (the strongest was around T5 on the [[TORRO scale|TORRO Tornado Scale]]) and no deaths occurred.<ref name=\"torro.org.uk\"/>\n\nSouthern England between the Isle of Wight and Beachy Head has been recognised as a 'hotspot' for tornadoes and waterspouts.<ref name=doe72>{{Cite book|last=Doe|first=Robert K.|title=Extreme Weather: Forty Years of the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|year=2016|isbn=978-1-118-95109-5|pages=72\u201374}}</ref>\nThe area (known as 'The Isle of Wight and South Coast Anomaly') has seen significant activity and is thought to be due to the shedding of  vortices,  downwind of the Isle of Wight, under certain weather conditions.<ref name=doe72/>\n\n==Climate history==\nThe climate of the United Kingdom has not always been the way it is today. During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The [[last glacial period]] was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted for tens of thousands of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great [[ice sheet]] extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of [[England]] (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of [[Wales]].\n\nThe cold period from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries is known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nThe temperature records in England are continuous back to the mid 17th century. The [[Central England temperature]] (CET) record is the oldest in the world, and is a compound source of cross-correlated records from several locations in central England. Precipitation records date back to the eighteenth century and the modern [[England and Wales Precipitation]] series begins in 1766.\n\nA detailed narrative account of the weather of every year from 1913 to 1942, with photographs of plants taken on the same day in each of those years, may be found in Willis (1944).<ref>Willis, J. H., (1944) ''Weatherwise'', London, George Allen and Unwin.</ref>\n\nAs with many parts of the world, over the last century the United Kingdom has reported a warming trend in temperatures. While some of this may be due to a recovery from the cooler period of climate mid 20th century (particularly the 1960s) the last 20 years has nonetheless seen an unprecedented level of warm weather. In July 2019, [[BBC]] reported that records from the [[Met Office]] show that the 10 warmest years in the UK have occurred since 2002, with 2014 being the warmest. In the same period, the coolest year has been 2010; however, this still only ranks 22nd on the overall list of coolest years on record.<ref>{{Cite

Although most units are constructed with bipolar transistors, field effect transistor units are also produced. The OTA is not as useful by itself in the vast majority of [[operational amplifier applications|standard op-amp functions]] as the ordinary op-amp because its output is a current.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} One of its principal uses is in implementing electronically controlled applications such as [[variable frequency oscillator]]s and filters and [[variable gain amplifier]] stages which are more difficult to implement with standard op-amps.\n\n== Principal differences from standard operational amplifiers ==\n\n* Its output of a ''current'' contrasts to that of standard operational amplifier whose output is a ''voltage''.\n* It is usually used \"open-loop\"; without negative feedback in linear applications. This is possible because the magnitude of the resistance attached to its output controls its output voltage. Therefore, a resistance can be chosen that keeps the output from going into [[Operational amplifier#Non-linear imperfections|saturation]], even with high differential input voltages.\n\n== Basic operation ==\n\nIn the ideal OTA, the output current is a linear function of the differential input voltage, calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>I_\\mathrm{out} = (V_\\mathrm{in+} - V_\\mathrm{in-}) \\cdot g_\\mathrm{m}</math>\n\nwhere ''V''<sub>in+</sub> is the voltage at the non-inverting input, ''V''<sub>in\u2212</sub> is the voltage at the inverting input and g<sub>m</sub> is the [[transconductance]] of the amplifier.\n\nThe amplifier's output voltage is the product of its output current and its load resistance:\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{out} = I_\\mathrm{out} \\cdot R_\\mathrm{load}</math>\n\nThe voltage gain is then the output voltage divided by the differential input voltage:\n\n:<math>G_\\mathrm{voltage} = {V_\\mathrm{out} \\over V_\\mathrm{in+} - V_\\mathrm{in-}} = R_\\mathrm{load} \\cdot g_\\mathrm{m}</math>\n\nThe transconductance of the amplifier is usually controlled by an input current, denoted I<sub>abc</sub> (\"amplifier bias current\"). The amplifier's transconductance is directly proportional to this current. This is the feature that makes it useful for electronic control of amplifier gain, etc.\n\n== Non-ideal characteristics ==\n\nAs with the standard op-amp, practical OTA's have some non-ideal characteristics. These include:\n\n* Input stage [[non-linearity]] at higher differential input voltages due to the characteristics of the input stage transistors. In the early devices, such as the CA3080, the input stage consisted of two bipolar transistors connected in the differential amplifier configuration. The transfer characteristics of this connection are approximately linear for differential input voltages of 20 mV or less.<ref>Jung, W.G., ''IC Array Cookbook''(Hayden, 1980) p. 40-41.</ref> This is an important limitation when the OTA is being used open loop as there is no negative feedback to linearize the output. One scheme to improve this parameter is mentioned below.\n* Temperature sensitivity of transconductance.\n* Variation of input and output impedance, input bias current and input offset voltage with the transconductance control current I<sub>abc</sub>.\n\n==Subsequent improvements==\n\nEarlier versions of the OTA had neither the I<sub>bias</sub> terminal (shown in the diagram) nor the diodes (shown adjacent to it). They were all added in later versions. As depicted in the diagram, the anodes of the diodes are attached together and the cathode of one is attached to the non inverting input (Vin+) and the cathode of the other to the inverting input (Vin&minus;). The diodes are biased at the anodes by a current (I<sub>bias</sub>) that is injected into the I<sub>bias</sub> terminal. These additions make two substantial improvements to the OTA. First, when used with input resistors, the diodes distort the differential input voltage to offset a significant amount of input stage non linearity at higher differential input voltages. According to National Semiconductor, the addition of these diodes increases the linearity of the input stage by a factor of 4. That is, using the diodes, the signal distortion level at 80 mV of differential input is the same as that of the simple differential amplifier at a differential input of 20 mV.<ref>Data Sheet for LM 13700 \u2013 Graph of Distortion v. Differential Input Voltage (National Semiconductor, June 2004) p. 6.</ref> Second, the action of the biased diodes offsets much of the temperature sensitivity of the OTA's transconductance.\n\nA second improvement is the integration of an optional-use output buffer amplifier to the chip on which the OTA resides. This is actually a convenience to a circuit designer rather than an improvement to the OTA itself; dispensing with the need to employ a separate buffer. It also allows the OTA to be used as a traditional op-amp, if desired, by converting its output current to a voltage.\n\nAn example of a chip combining both of these features is the National Semiconductor LM13600 and its successor, the [[LM13700]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LM13700 Dual Operational Transconductance Amplifiers With Linearizing Diodes and Buffers|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm13700.pdf|publisher=Texas Instruments|accessdate=26 January 2016|date=15 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Current differencing transconductance amplifier]]\n* [[Transimpedance amplifier]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141010084814/http://www.schmitzbits.de/ota3080.html A Short Discussion of the Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927084725/http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~lanterma/studentprojects/TeamOTAComparison.pdf Comparison of Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (content found on wayback machine)]\n* Examples: CA3080(obsolete product) [http://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/ca30/ca3080-a.pdf], MAX 435(obsolete product) [http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX435-MAX436.pdf], MAX 436(obsolete product) [http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX435-MAX436.pdf], LM13700 [http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm13700.pdf], OPA860 [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa860.pdf], OPA861 [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa861.pdf].\n* Discussion of alternatives: [http://www.elektor-labs.com/project/discrete-otas-for-synth-diy-elektor-formant-upgrades.14314.html].\n\n[[Category:Electronic amplifiers]]\n[[Category:Linear integrated circuits]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}\n\n[[Image:Operational transconductance amplifier symbol.svg|thumb|Schematic symbol for the OTA.

The film features the voices of [[E. G. Daily]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Christine Cavanaugh]], [[Kath Soucie]], [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]], [[Cree Summer]], and [[Charlie Adler]], along with guest stars [[David Spade]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Tim Curry]]. The events of the film take place before the [[List of Rugrats episodes|sixth season]] of ''Rugrats''.\n\nPlans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with [[Ren and Stimpy]] and [[Doug (series)|Doug]], began when Nickelodeon made a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce films between 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when contract expired, development of the film restarted with [[Paramount Pictures]] since Nick's parent company, [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], purchased the studio in 1994. \n\nThe film holds the distinction for being the first animated film from [[Nickelodeon Movies]], as well as the first to be based on a Nicktoon. Paramount Pictures originally released it in the United States on November 20, 1998.<ref name=AFIRugrats/> The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and grossed $141 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Didi Pickles]] is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with her second baby, which she believes will be a girl while everyone else believes it will be a boy. Didi goes into labor during her baby shower and her friends rush her to the hospital. While this is happening, the kids crawl off and explore a nursery area before being found by the other parents. When the baby is finally born after a montage of [[Reincarnation|past lives]], it turns out to a boy and they name him [[Dil Pickles|Dil]].\n\nDil quickly becomes a very spoiled and mean baby, crying non-stop for attention, not listening to his mom and dad, keeping all of the toys for himself, and refusing to share with [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]]. After a nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommy's teddy bear, their father, [[Stu Pickles|Stu]] has a conversation with him about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has, assuring him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside, which he calls his \"sponsitility\" (his term for responsibility).\n\nWhen Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the hospital despite Tommy's disapproval, and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a [[Reptar]] Wagon which Stu had built for a contest. Along the way, Dil secretly steals [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica's]] Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, [[List of Rugrats characters|Spike]] and they embark on a quest to find the babies and retrieve Cynthia.\n\nThe babies eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. They spot a ranger's cabin where they believe a \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]) lives, and decide to go there, believing that it can take them home. After an encounter with a gang of runaway circus monkeys, Dil is taken away by them. Tommy vows to find Dil by himself, after [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Phil and Lil]] agree they are better off without him.\n\nMeanwhile, the parents find out that the babies are missing and try to find them. However, it becomes a media sensation with numerous news reporters constantly asking the adults questions and intentionally enrages Stu's brother [[Drew Pickles|Drew]] into attacking Stu by telling him he lost Angelica.\n\nTommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully.\n\nAfter the storm, the other babies find Tommy and Dil, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the \"lizard\". While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys, but are then scared off by a scary [[wolf]] who's been hunting down the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via a [[pterodactyl]]-like aircraft he made, finally finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall by landing on a strut of the bridge. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys with their circus owners. The monkeys attack Rex Pester, the most obnoxious of all the news reporters, much to Betty and Charlotte's amusement. Dil finally learns to share when he drinks half of a bottle of formula and gives the other half to Tommy. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group after he assists them in getting an ice cream sundae form the top shelf of the refrigerator.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Grandpa Lou is sleeping in the Reptar Wagon when Grandpa Boris' goat kicks it, sending both the wagon and Grandpa down the street and presumably starting another adventure all over again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main article|List of Rugrats characters}}\n===Main===\n* [[E.

The first attempt was in 1993, when [[Nickelodeon]] made a two-year contract deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce new material, but a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their properties, one of those properties that mentioned was ''[[Rugrats]]'', alongside that the others were ''[[Doug (series)|Doug]]'' and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show#Nick-Fox film deal|The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'',<ref name=\"RugratsRotten\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rugrats_movie/|title=The Rugrats Movie|date=November 20, 1998|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en|title=Toledo Blade \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-08-13}}</ref> but the contract expired in 1995, with no movies produced (although ''Doug'' eventually got a [[Doug's 1st Movie|theatrical film]] from [[Disney]] in March 1999). In 1994, [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] acquired [[Paramount Pictures]], and Paramount would distribute the movies instead, development on the movie immediately started a year later after both the acquisition of Paramount and the deal with Fox expired.\n\nTwo months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \"The Family Tree\" was aired as the final episode of [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 5 (1998)|the fifth season.]] Both the film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\", that aired during the [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 8 (2001-03)|show's eighth season]] on June 1, 2002.\n\nTwo songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS,  DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on [[CBS]] and [[Nickelodeon]] television airings of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bootlegcomparisons.com/2019/03/17/the-rugrats-movie-dvd-vs-cbs-television-broadcast/|title=The Rugrats Movie: DVD Vs.

This short was later broadcast in ''CatDog'' Episode 21. However, the [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Laserdisc]] release contains a different ''CatDog'' short from Episode 28 titled \"''Winslow's Home Videos''\", in which Winslow shows clips of some of his favorite home videos featuring CatDog's wacky antics.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Home video===\n''The Rugrats Movie'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on March 30, 1999 by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]], which was reprinted many times. Paramount also released the film on [[Laserdisc]]. In 2011, the film was re-released in a three-disc trilogy set alongside its sequels, in honor of ''Rugrats''' 20th anniversary. In addition, it was re-released in some movie sets by Paramount, in 2016 with all the non-sequel Nickelodeon-animated movies up to ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', as well as a separate 2-disc set with ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]''.  <ref name=BillboardHomeVideo>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Seth|title=Paramount Preps For 'Rugrats' Vid|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yg0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7-IA5&dq=%22the+rugrats+movie%22+vhs+march+1999#v=onepage&q=%22the%20rugrats%20movie%22%20vhs%20march%201999|work=Billboard|accessdate=April 9, 2014|page=6|date=January 23, 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"rotten\" />\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 3, 1998\n| recorded   = 1998\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| length     = 41:51\n| label      = [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], [[Nickelodeon Records|Nickelodeon]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = Rugrats soundtrack\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie#Soundtrack|Rugrats in Paris: Music From the Motion Picture]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Take Me There (Blackstreet & M\u00fda song)|Take Me There]]\n | single1date = February 2, 1999\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}} [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0nfwxq9jldke link]\n| rev2 = [[Entertainment Weekly]]\n| rev2Score = C [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273982,00.html link]\n}}\n''The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture'' was released on November 3, 1998.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DHZX |title=The Rugrats Movie: Music From The Motion Picture [Enhanced CD] [ENHANCED] [SOUNDTRACK] | accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref> The enhanced soundtrack contained thirteen tracks, bonus CD-ROM demos and commercials.<ref name=\"cd\"/> [[Amazon.com]]'s Richard Gehr praised the CD for \"[bridging] demographics as nimbly as the [original] show itself [did]\" and for songs \"fans of all ages will love\".<ref name=\"cd\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s David Browne rated the ''Music From the Motion Picture'' with a C.<ref name=\"EWcd\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273982,00.html |date=January 8, 1999 |title=The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture (1998) |first=David |last=Browne | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBrowne noted that, while the soundtrack is enjoyable for children and does \"[make] concessions\" for parents, adults may dislike the amount of rap.<ref name=\"EWcd\"/> [[Allmusic]]'s William Ruhlmann reviewed the soundtrack positively, saying \"the result\" of the singers and songs \"is a romp in keeping with the tone of the show and the film\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0nfwxq9jldke|title=Rugrats: The Movie Original Soundtrack| website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=December 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\n\u2018The Rugrats Movie: Music from the Motion Picture'' spent twenty six weeks on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at #19.<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/album/original-soundtrack/rugrats-the-movie/327843|title=Rugrats: The Movie&nbsp;\u2013 Original...| work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] | accessdate=December 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOne song written for the film's soundtrack that was ultimately removed was \"(Safe in This) Sky Life\", a new track by English rock musician [[David Bowie]]; the song marked a reunion with longtime collaborator [[Tony Visconti]], who would go on to produce all of Bowie's material from 2002 up until [[Death of David Bowie|his death in 2016]].

Daily]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Christine Cavanaugh]], [[Kath Soucie]], [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]], [[Cree Summer]], and [[Charlie Adler]], along with guest stars [[David Spade]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Tim Curry]]. The events of the film take place before the [[List of Rugrats episodes|sixth season]] of ''Rugrats''.\n\nPlans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with [[Ren and Stimpy]] and [[Doug (series)|Doug]], began when Nickelodeon made a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce films between 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when contract expired, development of the film restarted with [[Paramount Pictures]] since Nick's parent company, [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], purchased the studio in 1994. \n\nThe film holds the distinction for being the first animated film from [[Nickelodeon Movies]], as well as the first to be based on a Nicktoon. Paramount Pictures originally released it in the United States on November 20, 1998.<ref name=AFIRugrats/> The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and grossed $141 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Didi Pickles]] is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with her second baby, which she believes will be a girl while everyone else believes it will be a boy. Didi goes into labor during her baby shower and her friends rush her to the hospital. While this is happening, the kids crawl off and explore a nursery area before being found by the other parents. When the baby is finally born after a montage of [[Reincarnation|past lives]], it turns out to a boy and they name him [[Dil Pickles|Dil]].\n\nDil quickly becomes a very spoiled and mean baby, crying non-stop for attention, not listening to his mom and dad, keeping all of the toys for himself, and refusing to share with [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]]. After a nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommy's teddy bear, their father, [[Stu Pickles|Stu]] has a conversation with him about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has, assuring him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside, which he calls his \"sponsitility\" (his term for responsibility).\n\nWhen Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the hospital despite Tommy's disapproval, and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a [[Reptar]] Wagon which Stu had built for a contest. Along the way, Dil secretly steals [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica's]] Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, [[List of Rugrats characters|Spike]] and they embark on a quest to find the babies and retrieve Cynthia.\n\nThe babies eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. They spot a ranger's cabin where they believe a \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]) lives, and decide to go there, believing that it can take them home. After an encounter with a gang of runaway circus monkeys, Dil is taken away by them. Tommy vows to find Dil by himself, after [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Phil and Lil]] agree they are better off without him.\n\nMeanwhile, the parents find out that the babies are missing and try to find them. However, it becomes a media sensation with numerous news reporters constantly asking the adults questions and intentionally enrages Stu's brother [[Drew Pickles|Drew]] into attacking Stu by telling him he lost Angelica.\n\nTommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully.\n\nAfter the storm, the other babies find Tommy and Dil, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the \"lizard\". While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys, but are then scared off by a [[wolf]] who's been hunting down the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via a [[pterodactyl]]-like aircraft he made, finally finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall by landing on a strut of the bridge. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys with their circus owners. The monkeys attack Rex Pester, the most obnoxious of all the news reporters, much to Betty and Charlotte's amusement. Dil finally learns to share when he drinks half of a bottle of formula and gives the other half to Tommy. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group after he assists them in getting an ice cream sundae form the top shelf of the refrigerator.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Grandpa Lou is sleeping in the Reptar Wagon when Grandpa Boris' goat kicks it, sending both the wagon and Grandpa down the street and presumably starting another adventure all over again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main article|List of Rugrats characters}}\n===Main===\n* [[E.

The first attempt was in 1993, when [[Nickelodeon]] made a two-year contract deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce new material, but a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their properties, one of those properties that mentioned was ''[[Rugrats]]'', alongside that the others were ''[[Doug (series)|Doug]]'' and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show#Nick-Fox film deal|The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'',<ref name=\"RugratsRotten\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rugrats_movie/|title=The Rugrats Movie|date=November 20, 1998|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en|title=Toledo Blade \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-08-13}}</ref> but the contract expired in 1995, with no movies produced (although ''Doug'' eventually got a [[Doug's 1st Movie|theatrical film]] from [[Disney]] in March 1999). In 1994, [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] acquired [[Paramount Pictures]], and Paramount would distribute the movies instead, development on the movie immediately started a year later after both the acquisition of Paramount and the deal with Fox expired.\n\nTwo months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \"The Family Tree\" was aired as the final episode of [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 5 (1998)|the fifth season.]] Both the film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\", that aired during the [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 8 (2001-03)|show's eighth season]] on June 1, 2002.\n\nTwo songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS,  DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on [[CBS]] and [[Nickelodeon]] television airings of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bootlegcomparisons.com/2019/03/17/the-rugrats-movie-dvd-vs-cbs-television-broadcast/|title=The Rugrats Movie: DVD Vs.

This short was later broadcast in ''CatDog'' Episode 21.
