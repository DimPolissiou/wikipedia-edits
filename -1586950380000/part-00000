Subsets of functional neurological disorders include '''functional neurological symptom disorder''' ('''FNsD'''), '''[[conversion disorder]]''', and '''psychogenic movement disorder'''/'''non-epileptic seizures'''.

It is important to note that the symptoms experienced by those with an FND are very real. At the same time, the origin of symptoms is complex since it can be associated with physical injury, severe [[psychological trauma]] (conversion disorder), and idiopathic neurological dysfunction. The core symptoms are those of motor or sensory function or episodes of altered awareness:\n\n*Limb weakness or paralysis\n*Blackouts (also called dissociative or non-epileptic seizures/attacks) \u2013 these may look like epileptic seizures or faints\n*Movement disorders including [[tremor]]s, [[dystonia]] (spasms), [[myoclonus]] (jerky movements)\n*Visual symptoms including loss of vision or double vision\n*Speech symptoms including [[dysphonia]] (whispering speech), slurred or stuttering speech\n*Sensory disturbance including hemisensory syndrome (altered sensation down one side of the body)\n\n===Associated conditions===\nEpidemiological studies and meta-analysis have shown higher rates of depression and anxiety in patients with FND compared to the general population, but rates are similar to patients with other neurological disorders such as epilepsy or [[Parkinson's disease]].  This is often the case because of years of misdiagnosis and accusations of malingering.<ref>Fiszman, A. & Kanner, A. M. in Gates and Rowan's Nonepileptic Seizures (eds. Schacter, S. & LaFrance Jr, W.

Signs of functional tremor include entrainment and distractibility. The patient with tremor should be asked to copy rhythmical movements with one hand or foot. If the tremor of the other hand entrains to the same rhythm, stops, or if the patient has trouble copying a simple movement this may indicate a functional tremor. Functional dystonia usually presents with an inverted ankle posture or clenched fist.  \nPositive features of dissociative or non-epileptic attacks include prolonged motionless unresponsiveness, long duration episodes (>2minutes) and symptoms of dissociation prior to the attack. These signs can be usefully discussed with patients when the diagnosis is being made.\n\nPatients with functional movement disorders and limb weakness may experience symptom onset triggered by an episode of acute pain, a physical injury or physical trauma. They may also experience symptoms when faced with a psychological stressor, but this isn't the case for most patients. Patients with functional neurological disorders are more likely to have a history of another illness such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain or fibromyalgia but this cannot be used to make a diagnosis.\nFND does not show up on blood tests or structural brain imaging such as MRI or CT scanning. However, this is also the case for many other neurological conditions so negative investigations should not be used alone to make the diagnosis. FND can, however, occur alongside other neurological diseases and tests may show non-specific abnormalities which cause confusion for doctors and patients.<ref name=\"Systematic review of misdiagnosis o\">{{cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Systematic review of misdiagnosis of conversion symptoms and 'hysteria' | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = | page = 989 }}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 diagnostic criteria===\nThe International Classification of Disease (ICD-11) which is due to be finalised in 2017 will have functional disorders within the neurology section for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = J. | last2 = Hallett | first2 = M. | last3 = Carson | first3 = A. | last4 = Bergen | first4 = D. | last5 = Shakir | first5 = R. | year = 2014 | title = Functional disorders in the Neurology section of ICD-11: A landmark opportunity | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 2299\u2013301 }}</ref>\n\n===Differential diagnoses===\nFunctional neurological symptom disorder can very rarely mimic many other conditions.<ref name=\":62\"/> Some alternative diagnoses for FND that are often considered include:\n*[[Hemiplegic migraine]]\n*[[Multiple sclerosis]]\n*[[Parkinson's syndrome|Parkinson's]]\n*Autoimmune disorders\n*[[Stroke]]\n*Vitamin B12 deficiency or [[Pernicious anemia|pernicious anaemia]]\n*[[Myasthenia gravis]]\n\n===Misdiagnosis===\nHistorically, misdiagnosis rates have been low.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=J.|last2=Sharpe|first2=M.|last3=Rothwell|first3=P.

It is essential that the health professional confirms that this is a common problem which is genuine, not imagined and not a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\nConfidence in the diagnosis does not improve symptoms, but appears to improve the efficacy of treatments such as physiotherapy which require altering established abnormal patterns of movement.\n\nA multi-disciplinary approach to treating functional neurological disorder is recommended. \nTreatment options can include:\n*Physiotherapy and [[occupational therapy]]\n*Medication such as sleeping tablets, painkillers, anti-epileptic medications and anti-depressants (for patients suffering with depression co-morbid or for pain relief)\n\nPhysiotherapy with someone who understands functional disorders may be the initial treatment of choice for patients with motor symptoms such as weakness, gait (walking) disorder and movement disorders.  Nielsen et al. have reviewed the medical literature on physiotherapy for functional motor disorders up to 2012 and concluded that the available studies, although limited, mainly report positive results.<ref name=\"Nielsen, G. 2013\">Nielsen, G., Stone, J. & Edwards, M. J. Physiotherapy for functional (psychogenic) motor symptoms: a systematic review. ''J. Psychosom. Res.'' 75, 93\u2013102 (2013)</ref> Since then several studies have shown positive outcomes. In one study, up to 65% of patients were very much or much improved after five days of intensive physiotherapy even though 55% of patients were thought to have poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Nielsen, G. 2013\"/> In a randomised controlled trial of physiotherapy there was significant improvement in mobility which was sustained on one year follow up.<ref>Jordbru, A.

Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 895\u2013900 }}</ref>\n\nFor patients with severe and chronic FND a combination of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy may be the best combination with positive studies being published in patients who have had symptoms for up to three years before treatment.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) alone may be beneficial in treating patients with dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures.  A randomised controlled trial of patients who undertook 12 sessions of CBT which taught patients how to interrupt warning signs before seizure onset, challenged unhelpful thoughts and helped patients start activities they had been avoiding found a reduction in the seizure frequency with positive outcomes sustained at six month follow up.  A large multicentre trial of CBT for dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures started in 2015 in the UK.<ref>[([http://www.codestrial.org])]</ref>\n\nFor many patients with FND, accessing treatment can be difficult.  Availability of expertise is limited and they may feel that they are being dismissed or told 'it's all in your head' especially if psychological input is part of the treatment plan. Some medical professionals are uncomfortable explaining and treating patients with functional symptoms.  Changes in the diagnostic criteria, increasing evidence, literature about how to make the diagnosis and how to explain it and changes in medical training is slowly changing this.<ref>Edwards, M. J. Functional neurological symptoms: welcome to the new normal. Pract. Neurol. 16, 2\u20133 (2016)</ref>\n\nAfter a diagnosis of functional neurological disorder has been made, it is important that the neurologist explains the illness fully to the patient to ensure the patient understands the diagnosis.\n\nSome, but not all patients with FND may experience low moods or anxiety due to their condition. However, they will often not seek treatment due being worried that a doctor will blame their symptoms on their anxiety or depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosymptoms.org/#/in-the-mind/4533053408|title=neurosymptoms.org|website=www.neurosymptoms.org|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>\n\nIt is recommended that the treatment of functional neurological disorder should be balanced and involve a whole-person approach. This means that it should include professionals from multiple departments, including neurologists, general practitioners (or primary health care providers), physiotherapists, occupational therapists. At the same time, ruling out secondary gain, malingering, conversion disorder and other factors, including the time and financial resources involved in assessing and treating patients who demand hospital resources but would be better served in psychological settings, must all be balanced.\n\n==Prevalence==\nEstimates suggest that up to a third of neurology outpatients have functional symptoms making them the second most common reason for a neurological outpatient visit after headache/migraine.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/our_work/long_term_conditions/neurological_health_services/neurological_symptoms_report.aspx|title=Neurological functional symptoms stepped care report|website=www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org|accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref> In particular, dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures account for about 1 in 7 referrals to neurologists after an initial seizure, and functional weakness has a similar prevalence to [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>Stone, J.

This led to an understanding that it could affect both sexes. Jean Martin Charcot argued that, what would be later called FND, was caused by \"a hereditary degeneration of the nervous system, namely a neurological disorder\".<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Tasca|first=Cecilia|last2=Rapetti|first2=Mariangela|last3=Carta|first3=Mauro Giovanni|last4=Fadda|first4=Bianca|date=2012-10-19|title=Women And Hysteria In The History Of Mental Health|journal=Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health|volume=8|pages=110\u2013119|doi=10.2174/1745017901208010110|issn=1745-0179|pmc=3480686|pmid=23115576}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, the illness was confirmed as being a neurological disorder but a small number of doctors still believed in the previous definition.<ref name=\":32\"/> However, as early as 1874, doctors including W.

Omerod began to speak out against this other term due to there being no evidence of its existence.<ref name=\":42\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richardwebster.net/freudandhysteria.html|title=Sigmund Freud: somatization, medicine and misdiagnosis|last=Webster|first=Richard|website=www.richardwebster.net|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term \"conversion disorder\" has been in existence for many years, another term was still being used in the 20th century.

Subsets of functional neurological disorders include '''functional neurological symptom disorder''' ('''FNsD'''), '''[[conversion disorder]]''', and '''psychogenic movement disorder'''/'''non-epileptic seizures'''. Functional neurological disorders are  common in neurological services, accounting for up to one third of outpatient neurology clinic attendances, and associated with as much physical disability and distress as other [[neurological disorder]]s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Stone, J. et al.

Neurol. {{PMID|2641}}, (2015).</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThere are a great number of symptoms experienced by those with a functional neurological disorder. It is important to note that the symptoms experienced by those with an FND are very real. At the same time, the origin of symptoms is complex since it can be associated with physical injury, severe [[psychological trauma]] (conversion disorder), and idiopathic neurological dysfunction. The core symptoms are those of motor or sensory function or episodes of altered awareness:\n\n*Limb weakness or paralysis\n*Blackouts (also called dissociative or non-epileptic seizures/attacks) \u2013 these may look like epileptic seizures or faints\n*Movement disorders including [[tremor]]s, [[dystonia]] (spasms), [[myoclonus]] (jerky movements)\n*Visual symptoms including loss of vision or double vision\n*Speech symptoms including [[dysphonia]] (whispering speech), slurred or stuttering speech\n*Sensory disturbance including hemisensory syndrome (altered sensation down one side of the body)\n\n===Associated conditions===\nEpidemiological studies and meta-analysis have shown higher rates of depression and anxiety in patients with FND compared to the general population, but rates are similar to patients with other neurological disorders such as epilepsy or [[Parkinson's disease]].  This is often the case because of years of misdiagnosis and accusations of malingering.<ref>Fiszman, A. & Kanner, A. M. in Gates and Rowan's Nonepileptic Seizures (eds. Schacter, S. & LaFrance Jr, W.

Signs of functional tremor include entrainment and distractibility. The patient with tremor should be asked to copy rhythmical movements with one hand or foot. If the tremor of the other hand entrains to the same rhythm, stops, or if the patient has trouble copying a simple movement this may indicate a functional tremor. Functional dystonia usually presents with an inverted ankle posture or clenched fist.  \nPositive features of dissociative or non-epileptic attacks include prolonged motionless unresponsiveness, long duration episodes (>2minutes) and symptoms of dissociation prior to the attack. These signs can be usefully discussed with patients when the diagnosis is being made.\n\nPatients with functional movement disorders and limb weakness may experience symptom onset triggered by an episode of acute pain, a physical injury or physical trauma. They may also experience symptoms when faced with a psychological stressor, but this isn't the case for most patients. Patients with functional neurological disorders are more likely to have a history of another illness such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain or fibromyalgia but this cannot be used to make a diagnosis.\nFND does not show up on blood tests or structural brain imaging such as MRI or CT scanning. However, this is also the case for many other neurological conditions so negative investigations should not be used alone to make the diagnosis. FND can, however, occur alongside other neurological diseases and tests may show non-specific abnormalities which cause confusion for doctors and patients.<ref>Stone, J. et al.

It is essential that the health professional confirms that this is a common problem which is genuine, not imagined and not a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\nConfidence in the diagnosis does not improve symptoms, but appears to improve the efficacy of treatments such as physiotherapy which require altering established abnormal patterns of movement.\n\nA multi-disciplinary approach to treating functional neurological disorder is recommended. \nTreatment options can include:\n*Physiotherapy and [[occupational therapy]]\n*Medication such as sleeping tablets, painkillers, anti-epileptic medications and anti-depressants (for patients suffering with depression co-morbid or for pain relief)\n\nPhysiotherapy with someone who understands functional disorders may be the initial treatment of choice for patients with motor symptoms such as weakness, gait (walking) disorder and movement disorders.  Nielsen et al. have reviewed the medical literature on physiotherapy for functional motor disorders up to 2012 and concluded that the available studies, although limited, mainly report positive results.<ref name=\"Nielsen, G. 2013\">Nielsen, G., Stone, J. & Edwards, M. J. Physiotherapy for functional (psychogenic) motor symptoms: a systematic review. J. Psychosom. Res. 75, 93\u2013102 (2013)</ref> Since then several studies have shown positive outcomes. In one study, up to 65% of patients were very much or much improved after five days of intensive physiotherapy even though 55% of patients were thought to have poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Nielsen, G. 2013\"/> In a randomised controlled trial of physiotherapy there was significant improvement in mobility which was sustained on one year follow up.<ref>Jordbru, A. A., Smedstad, L. M., Klungsoyr, O. & Martinsen, E. W. Psychogenic gait: a randomized controlled trial on effect on rehabilitation. Clin.

Benefit from treatment continued even when patients were contacted up 25 months after treatment.<ref>McCormack, R. et al. Specialist inpatient treatment for severe motor conversion disorder: a retrospective comparative study. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry 85, 895\u2013900 (2014)</ref>\n\nFor patients with severe and chronic FND a combination of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy may be the best combination with positive studies being published in patients who have had symptoms for up to three years before treatment.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) alone may be beneficial in treating patients with dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures.  A randomised controlled trial of patients who undertook 12 sessions of CBT which taught patients how to interrupt warning signs before seizure onset, challenged unhelpful thoughts and helped patients start activities they had been avoiding found a reduction in the seizure frequency with positive outcomes sustained at six month follow up.  A large multicentre trial of CBT for dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures started in 2015 in the UK.<ref>[([http://www.codestrial.org])]</ref>\n\nFor many patients with FND, accessing treatment can be difficult.  Availability of expertise is limited and they may feel that they are being dismissed or told 'it's all in your head' especially if psychological input is part of the treatment plan. Some medical professionals are uncomfortable explaining and treating patients with functional symptoms.  Changes in the diagnostic criteria, increasing evidence, literature about how to make the diagnosis and how to explain it and changes in medical training is slowly changing this.<ref>Edwards, M. J. Functional neurological symptoms: welcome to the new normal. Pract. Neurol. 16, 2\u20133 (2016)</ref>\n\nAfter a diagnosis of functional neurological disorder has been made, it is important that the neurologist explains the illness fully to the patient to ensure the patient understands the diagnosis.\n\nSome, but not all patients with FND may experience low moods or anxiety due to their condition. However, they will often not seek treatment due being worried that a doctor will blame their symptoms on their anxiety or depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosymptoms.org/#/in-the-mind/4533053408|title=neurosymptoms.org|website=www.neurosymptoms.org|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>\n\nIt is recommended that the treatment of functional neurological disorder should be balanced and involve a whole-person approach. This means that it should include professionals from multiple departments, including neurologists, general practitioners (or primary health care providers), physiotherapists, occupational therapists. At the same time, ruling out secondary gain, malingering, conversion disorder and other factors, including the time and financial resources involved in assessing and treating patients who demand hospital resources but would be better served in psychological settings, must all be balanced.\n\n==Prevalence==\nEstimates suggest that up to a third of neurology outpatients have functional symptoms making them the second most common reason for a neurological outpatient visit after headache/migraine.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/our_work/long_term_conditions/neurological_health_services/neurological_symptoms_report.aspx|title=Neurological functional symptoms stepped care report|website=www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org|accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref> In particular, dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures account for about 1 in 7 referrals to neurologists after an initial seizure, and functional weakness has a similar prevalence to [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>Stone, J.

The Pur\u00e9pecha are descendants of a late arrival of [[Chichimeca]] who came from the north. At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the Pur\u00e9pechan state in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today [[Santa F\u00e9 de la Laguna]], and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Patzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, as they absorbed peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztec, having expanded their territory over much of what is now Michoac\u00e1n and into part of [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]]. The Aztec attempted to invade the Pur\u00e9pecha but were repelled.

He was succeeded by [[Tanganxoan II]]. The first Spaniard to the area was [[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]]. The Spanish destruction of Tenochtitlan and their promise to allow him to remain ruler convinced Tanganxoan II to submit to Spanish rule.

These lands were divided into [[encomienda]]s among the [[conquistador]]s. The provinces with the largest populations were called Alcaldias Mayores, with Michoac\u00e1n being one of these, with its capital initially at [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoac\u00e1n|Tzintzuntzan]]. Soon after, it was moved to Patzcuaro and eventually settled in what is now Morelia. The provincial and later state capital was founded by [[viceroy]] [[Antonio de Mendoza]] in 1541.

As first governor, Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n disrupted and devastated the social and economic order of the area. Vasco de Quirga succeeded Guzman, bringing Franciscan and Augustinian friars to both evangelize and repair the area's broken economy and social institutions.

The school was moved to Morelia in 1580 and was fused with the Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. In 1590, its name was changed to the Seminario Tridentino, afterwards to Seminario Conciliar in 1601. By the end of the 17th century, the name returned to Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s but its structure was profoundly changed, adding studies such as philosophy, civil law, and others. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, a number of figures associated with the Mexican War of Independence, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos and others were associated with this school. By the mid-19th century, the school had been secularized and renamed the Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo adding studies such as chemistry, physics and other sciences.

By the mid-17th century, the indigenous population had declined by half. In 1776, the territory of Michoac\u00e1n was reduced to the area in which the modern states of Michoac\u00e1n and Colima are now. Soon after, Colima split to join with the province of Guadalajara, leaving Michoac\u00e1n roughly with the territory it has today.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nDuring the entire colonial period, the economy was concentrated in the hands of the Spanish-born, who held vast lands and haciendas. They also held the rights over minerals mined in places such as Tlalpujahua, Angangueo and [[Huetamo]]. Indigenous peoples were exploited for their work, and [[slavery]] was not uncommon. Education was restricted for only those born in Spain and their descendants and was controlled by the Church. The main educational institutions were the Colegio de San Nicolas, founded in the 16th century; and the Seminary of San Pedro and San Pablo, founded in the 18th century. These schools produced a number of distinguished men, but the best-known is [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]].<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\nAt the end of the 18th century, ideas from Europe began to infiltrate the upper classes of the state, especially in Valladolid (Morelia) and [[Zamora, Michoac\u00e1n|Zamora]].

The state was declared a department in 1836 but became a more independent state again in 1846. Colima broke off from Michoac\u00e1n to form its own state in this year. In 1849, the municipality of Coyuca was separated to form the state of Guerrero. In 1853, the state became a department again, regaining state status in 1856.

It is considered to be a continuation of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. Peaks in this range average about {{convert|2900|m}} above sea level, with the largest being the Cerro de las Canoas. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state from west to east toward the [[Toluca Valley]] and [[Valley of Mexico]]. This mountain range is marked by appearance of many volcanoes, active, dormant, and extinct alike. This system is subdivided into regions such as the Sierra de Tanc\u00edtaro, Sierra de Periban, Sierra de San Angel and others. The best-known volcano in this region is the [[Paricut\u00edn]] volcano.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe state has a considerable natural system of waterways, including parts of two of the country's largest rivers, the [[Lerma River|Lerma]] and the Balsas. These waterways are divided into three regions, called the North, Central and South.  The North region includes the Lerma Basin.  On the Lerma River is the Tepuxtepec Dam which has a capacity of 371 million m<sup>3</sup>. Rivers that empty into the Lerma in Michoac\u00e1n include the Tlalpuhahua, Cachivi and Duero.

Average temperatures vary from {{convert|13|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|29|\u00b0C}}. Lower temperatures correspond with the highland areas in the north and east while the lower south and west, called La Costa (the coast) or [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] (hot land) register higher temperatures. In the hotter lowlands, high temperatures regularly exceed {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} and have been known to reach over {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in the summer. The lowest temperatures are registered in highland areas such as the Sierra de Coalcom\u00e1n and the Sierra del Centro located near the border with the State of Mexico.

Three-fifths of this agriculture occurs only during the rainy season. [[Irrigation]] farming is restricted to areas such as the [[Apatzing\u00e1n Valley]], the [[Baj\u00edo]] area of Michoac\u00e1n, the [[Zamora Valley]] and some others. Principal crops include corn, [[sorghum]], [[avocado]]s, [[strawberries]], peaches, wheat, limes, sugar cane and [[mango]]s. While corn accounts for 43% of the crops harvested, Michoac\u00e1n is the largest producer of avocados in Mexico and in the world. Forty three percent of farmland in the territory is dedicated to the raising of livestock, including cattle, domestic fowl, sheep, goats and pigs.

These forests mostly produce lumber and resin. These areas are estimated at 2,160,000 hectares, over half of which is pine forest. The most productive forests are located in the central and eastern portions of the state. Rainforest areas are estimated at 460,500 hectares.

However, iron is mined in the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas area near the coast. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals are mined in the state. These include [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[fill dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], and others.

Michoac\u00e1n is the second-largest producer of coke and third-largest producer of iron, which are essential to the steel industry, in Mexico. While there remains significant metallic deposits, their mining only contributes 1.64% to the economy.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/><ref name=\"economia\"/>\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nMost industrial activity is concentrated in the central region of the state, near the capital, where a number of industrial parks are located, such as Ciudad Industrial Morelia. However. there are other areas with industry, such as Apatzing\u00e1n, Zamora, [[Jiquilpan, Michoac\u00e1n|Jiquilpan]] and [[Sahuayo]], as well as in the [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Michoac\u00e1n|L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] area.

This is celebrated on the dates around 2 November. Essentially, these are [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations, which are celebrated all over Mexico, but with unique variations. The events of these days show a blending of both pre-Hispanic and Catholic beliefs and traditions. Noche de Muertos is celebrated most strongly in the towns and villages around Lake Patzcuaro such as Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, as well as Patzuaro itself, which was the center of the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire.  As in other parts of Mexico, altars to the dead, both in homes and on graves are erected and covered with offerings such as bread, fruit and other items. One aspect which is unique to the event here is the lighting and floating of hundreds of small candles and flowers on Lake Patzcuaro on the night between 1 and 2 November. It is also believed that on this night the souls of Mintzita, the daughter of Pur\u00e9pecha king Tzintzicha and Itzihuapa, son of Tar\u00e9 rise.

At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced.

Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, as they absorbed peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztec, having expanded their territory over much of what is now Michoac\u00e1n and into part of [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]].

Because of this attack, the Pur\u00e9pecha later denied the Aztecs aid in their defense of [[Tenochtitlan]] against the Spanish.<ref name=\"elochis\"/><ref name=\"prehis\"/>\n\nPrior to the arrival of any Spaniard in the territory, then-ruler [[Zuanga]] died of [[smallpox]], presumably carried by one of the Aztec delegations seeking military aid. He was succeeded by [[Tanganxoan II]]. The first Spaniard to the area was [[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]]. The Spanish destruction of Tenochtitlan and their promise to allow him to remain ruler convinced Tanganxoan II to submit to Spanish rule. But, [[Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n]] reneged on this agreement and killed Tanganxoan II in 1530.<ref name=\"elochis\"/><ref name=\"hiscolonial\">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/colonia.html |title=El Estado de Michoac\u00e1n Epoca Colonial |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n |language=Spanish |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Colonial Era |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302161902/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/colonia.html |archive-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:FacSaludPatzcuaro.JPG|thumb|left|Basilica of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Salud in Patzcuaro]]\nDuring the first years of the Conquest, Michoac\u00e1n was part of the \"kingdom of Mexico\" which included the current states of Mexico, Quer\u00e9taro, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Morelos]], Guerrero, [[Veracruz]], [[Tabasco]], Michoac\u00e1n, [[Guanajuato]] and parts of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], Jalisco and Colima. These lands were divided into [[encomienda]]s among the [[conquistador]]s. The provinces with the largest populations were called Alcaldias Mayores, with Michoac\u00e1n being one of these, with its capital initially at [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoac\u00e1n|Tzintzuntzan]]. Soon after, it was moved to Patzcuaro and eventually settled in what is now Morelia. The provincial and later state capital was founded by [[viceroy]] [[Antonio de Mendoza]] in 1541. It became the political and ecclesiastical center of the province after the death of [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in 1565.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nSoon after the Conquest, evangelists from the [[Franciscan]], [[Augustinian]], [[Carmelite]] and other orders established monasteries all over the territory. Some of the best-known are [[Juan de Moya]], [[Mart\u00edn de la Coru\u00f1a]] and [[Jacob the Dacian]]. As first governor, Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n disrupted and devastated the social and economic order of the area. Vasco de Quirga succeeded Guzman, bringing Franciscan and Augustinian friars to both evangelize and repair the area's broken economy and social institutions. Quiroga founded the Spanish city of Patzcuaro in 1538, calling it the Ciudad de Mechuac\u00e1n.<ref name=\"elochis\"/> For his efforts, Quiroga is still referred to in the Patzcuaro area as \"Tata (grandfather) Vasco\".<ref name=\"hiscolonial\"/> The diocese of Michoac\u00e1n was established in 1536 by [[Pope Paul III]], and its boundaries coincide with the old [[Pur\u00e9pecha kingdom]]. Its first bishop was Vasco de Quiroga.<ref name=\"cathenc\">{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10282a.htm |title= Archdiocese of Michoacan |work= Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo]] began as the Colegio de San Nicolas Obispo, founded by Vasco de Quiroga in Patzcuaro in 1540. It was originally a seminary for the training of evangelists. It was granted a royal seal in 1543 to become the Real Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s Obispo. The school was moved to Morelia in 1580 and was fused with the Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. In 1590, its name was changed to the Seminario Tridentino, afterwards to Seminario Conciliar in 1601. By the end of the 17th century, the name returned to Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s but its structure was profoundly changed, adding studies such as philosophy, civil law, and others. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, a number of figures associated with the Mexican War of Independence, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos and others were associated with this school. By the mid-19th century, the school had been secularized and renamed the Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo adding studies such as chemistry, physics and other sciences. The current name and organization was adopted after the Mexican Revolution in 1917.<ref name=\"umich\">{{cite web |last=Zamudio |first=Silvia Figueroa |url=http://www.umich.mx/Historia.html |title=Historia Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo |publisher=UMSNH |location=Michoac\u00e1n |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nFrom the 16th to the 18th centuries, Augustinian, Franciscan and Carmelite missions were constructed in the territory as well as civil constructions, especially in the city now known as Morelia. Mining in areas such as [[Angangueo]], [[Tlalpujahua]] and [[Inguaran]] had begun, as well as the establishment of agricultural and livestock [[haciendas]]. The first school of higher education, called the Primera Casa de Altos Estudios en Am\u00e9rica, was founded by Alonso de la Veracruz in [[Tiripet\u00edo]].<ref name=\"hiscolonial\"/> Michoac\u00e1n was made a separate province from \"Mexico\" in 1602. By the mid-17th century, the indigenous population had declined by half. In 1776, the territory of Michoac\u00e1n was reduced to the area in which the modern states of Michoac\u00e1n and Colima are now. Soon after, Colima split to join with the province of Guadalajara, leaving Michoac\u00e1n roughly with the territory it has today.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nDuring the entire colonial period, the economy was concentrated in the hands of the Spanish-born, who held vast lands and haciendas. They also held the rights over minerals mined in places such as Tlalpujahua, Angangueo and [[Huetamo]]. Indigenous peoples were exploited for their work, and [[slavery]] was not uncommon. Education was restricted for only those born in Spain and their descendants and was controlled by the Church. The main educational institutions were the Colegio de San Nicolas, founded in the 16th century; and the Seminary of San Pedro and San Pablo, founded in the 18th century. These schools produced a number of distinguished men, but the best-known is [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]].<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\nAt the end of the 18th century, ideas from Europe began to infiltrate the upper classes of the state, especially in Valladolid (Morelia) and [[Zamora, Michoac\u00e1n|Zamora]].

Soon after Hidalgo performed the [[Grito de Dolores]] in Dolores (now [[Dolores Hidalgo]]), Guanajuato, a number of people influenced by his thought took up arms against the colonial government. These included [[Manuel de la Torre Lloreda]], [[Gertrudis Bocanegra]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garcia Obeso]] and [[Ignacio L\u00f3pez Ray\u00f3n]]. During his campaign, Hidalgo returned to Valladolid, issuing a decree eliminating slavery.<ref name=\"historiaind\"/>\n\nAfter Hidalgo's death, much of the insurgent government was located in Michoac\u00e1n, with documents such as \"Primera Constituci\u00f3n o Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la Am\u00e9rica Mexicana\" (First Constitution or Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of the Mexican America) and \"Sentimentos de la Nacion\", both of which would shape constitutions and governments in the years to come. The first [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Mexican Supreme Court]] was also founded here. The Mexican War of Independence was culminated by the army of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], also a Michoac\u00e1n native, who took Morelia in May 1821.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nAfter the war ended in 1821, the territory of Michoac\u00e1n became the \"Free and Sovereign State of Michoac\u00e1n on 31 January 1824.<ref name=\"historiaind\"/> This state was initially divided into 4 departments and 22 portions (partidos) under the Ley Territorial of 1825, with the first constitution ratified in the same year. The name of the capital was changed from Valladolid to Morelia at the same time.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nIn 1831, the state was reorganized into 61 municipalities and 207 locales (tenencias). Due to the struggle between centralists and federalists in Mexico in the 19th century, Michoac\u00e1n's rights as an entity would change depending on who was in control. The state was declared a department in 1836 but became a more independent state again in 1846. Colima broke off from Michoac\u00e1n to form its own state in this year. In 1849, the municipality of Coyuca was separated to form the state of Guerrero. In 1853, the state became a department again, regaining state status in 1856. In 1857, [[Contepec]] was separated from the state of Guanajuato and attached to Michoac\u00e1n.<ref>{{cite book |date=1996 |title=Estado de Michoac\u00e1n de Ocampo.

One of the first victories against the French during the Intervention occurred in Zamora.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nIn 1907, Michoac\u00e1n's boundaries changed again with the addition of the communities of [[Pungarabato]] and [[Zirandaro]] added from Guerrero state to make the [[Balsas River]] a natural border.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nThe [[Mexican Revolution]] came to Michoac\u00e1n in 1911, when those loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] proclaimed [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] as their territory, then went on to take towns around Lake Patzcuaro under the leadership of [[Salvador Escalante]]. The governor of the state, Aristeo Mendoza, resigned. Fighting among various factions would continue in parts of the state for the rest of the war. The state's current constitution was ratified in 1918.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nIn 1920, the [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo]] was founded.<ref name=\"elochis\"/>\n\nSoon after the end of the Revolution, the [[Cristero War]] would affect the state, which affected agricultural production and distribution. In 1926, hostilities closed the seminaries in Morelia and Zamora.

The Sierra Madre del Sur crosses the state northwest to southeast for approximately {{convert|200|km}} in the southwest between the municipalities of [[Chinicuila]] and [[Arteaga, Michoac\u00e1n|Arteaga]] along the Pacific Coast. It is considered to be a continuation of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. Peaks in this range average about {{convert|2900|m}} above sea level, with the largest being the Cerro de las Canoas. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state from west to east toward the [[Toluca Valley]] and [[Valley of Mexico]]. This mountain range is marked by appearance of many volcanoes, active, dormant, and extinct alike. This system is subdivided into regions such as the Sierra de Tanc\u00edtaro, Sierra de Periban, Sierra de San Angel and others. The best-known volcano in this region is the [[Paricut\u00edn]] volcano.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe state has a considerable natural system of waterways, including parts of two of the country's largest rivers, the [[Lerma River|Lerma]] and the Balsas. These waterways are divided into three regions, called the North, Central and South.  The North region includes the Lerma Basin.  On the Lerma River is the Tepuxtepec Dam which has a capacity of 371 million m<sup>3</sup>. Rivers that empty into the Lerma in Michoac\u00e1n include the Tlalpuhahua, Cachivi and Duero.  Another river basin here is that of [[Lake Cuitzeo]], which extends over an area of {{convert|3618|m2}}. The two main rivers that feed this lake are the Grande de Morelia and Quer\u00e9ndaro.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n[[File:Sierra-madre-del-sur.JPG|thumb|Sierra Madre del Sur along the Michoac\u00e1n coast]]\nThe Central region is represented by lakes [[Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro|P\u00e1tzcuaro]] and [[Lake Zirahu\u00e9n|Zirahu\u00e9n]]. Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro has a surface area of 1,525&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. This lake is fed by a number of surface and subterranean water flows with the principal rivers leading here including the San Gregorio and Chapultepec. This lake has five islands within it called [[Janitzio]], Yunu\u00e9n, La Pacanda, Tecu\u00e9n, Jar\u00e1cuaro, Urand\u00e9n and Cari\u00e1n. Lake Zirahu\u00e9n has an area of {{convert|615|km2}} and is fed by streams such as Manzanilla and Zinamba. These two lakes are considered to be the main tourist attraction of the state.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nMost of the state's rivers and streams are located in the south region of the state, with the Balsas River being the most important. The most important tributaries of this river include the Cutzamala, Car\u00e1cuaro and Tepalcatepec rivers. Within this region is the coastal watershed, which is the area between the Sierra Madre del Sur and the coastline. This area includes small rivers such as the Coahuayana, Aquila, Ostula, Mot\u00edn del Oro, Coire, Cach\u00e1n and Nexpa which flow directly into the Pacific.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nMuch of the climate of the state is determined by altitude and other geographical features. Average temperatures vary from {{convert|13|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|29|\u00b0C}}. Lower temperatures correspond with the highland areas in the north and east while the lower south and west, called La Costa (the coast) or [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] (hot land) register higher temperatures. In the hotter lowlands, high temperatures regularly exceed {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} and have been known to reach over {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in the summer. The lowest temperatures are registered in highland areas such as the Sierra de Coalcom\u00e1n and the Sierra del Centro located near the border with the State of Mexico. Except for the Tierra Caliente, most of the state can experience freezing temperatures in the winter. Rainfall is also dependent on altitude with the lowlands receiving less rain than the mountain areas. There is a well-defined rainy season which extends from June to October over the entire state.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\n===Flora===\nEcosystems vary by altitude. Between {{convert|2600|and|3500|m}} above sea level, most of the vegetation is conifer forests. Between {{convert|1000|and|2600|m}}, there are mixed forests and below this is broadleaf or tropical forests.

[[Irrigation]] farming is restricted to areas such as the [[Apatzing\u00e1n Valley]], the [[Baj\u00edo]] area of Michoac\u00e1n, the [[Zamora Valley]] and some others. Principal crops include corn, [[sorghum]], [[avocado]]s, strawberries, peaches, wheat, limes, sugar cane and [[mango]]s. While corn accounts for 43% of the crops harvested, Michoac\u00e1n is the largest producer of avocados in Mexico and in the world. Forty three percent of farmland in the territory is dedicated to the raising of livestock, including cattle, domestic fowl, sheep, goats and pigs.

These forests mostly produce lumber and resin. These areas are estimated at 2,160,000 hectares, over half of which is pine forest. The most productive forests are located in the central and eastern portions of the state. Rainforest areas are estimated at 460,500 hectares. One problem facing the forested areas of the state is unsustainable logging.

However, iron is mined in the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas area near the coast. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals are mined in the state. These include [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[fill dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], and others. There are thirteen principal mining areas: Tlalpujahua, Angangueo, Los Azufres, Real de Otzumatl\u00e1n, Tzitzio, Ti\u00e1maro, El Bast\u00e1n, San Diego Curucupac\u00e9o, Inguar\u00e1n, Las Truchas, and La Minita de Coalcom\u00e1n. Michoac\u00e1n is the second-largest producer of coke and third-largest producer of iron, which are essential to the steel industry, in Mexico.

This is celebrated on the dates around 2 November. Essentially, these are [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations, which are celebrated all over Mexico, but with unique variations. The events of these days show a blending of both pre-Hispanic and Catholic beliefs and traditions. Noche de Muertos is celebrated most strongly in the towns and villages around Lake Patzcuaro such as Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, as well as Patzuaro itself, which was the center of the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire.  As in other parts of Mexico, altars to the dead, both in homes and on graves are erected and covered with offerings such as bread, fruit and other items. One aspect which is unique to the event here is the lighting and floating of hundreds of small candles and flowers on Lake Patzcuaro on the night between 1 and 2 November. It is also believed that on this night the souls of Mintzita, the daughter of Pur\u00e9pecha king Tzintzicha and Itzihuapa, son of Tar\u00e9 rise. Theirs is a Romeo and Juliet story as they were never able to marry due to the Spanish invasion of their lands. Today, it is said that the two rise up and head toward a specific cemetery to receive visitors.

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND (WAter Grid SCIntillator Detector - prototype Magnetized Iron Neutrino Detector) is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.<ref name=\"babymind\">{{cite journal|display-authors=1 |last1=Antonova |first1=M. |last2=Asfandiyarov |first2=R. |title=Baby MIND: A magnetised spectrometer for the WAGASCI experiment |arxiv=1704.08079 |year=2017}}</ref><ref name=\"wagasci\">{{cite journal|display-authors=1 |last1=Ovsiannikova |first1=T |last2=Antonova |first2=M |title=The new experiment WAGASCI for water to hydrocarbon neutrino cross section measurement using the J-PARC beam |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=5 February 2016 |volume=675 |issue=1 |pages=012030 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/675/1/012030}}</ref>\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}} decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layers designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment.

It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target.

The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}} decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the [[magnetic horn|horns]] focusing secondary particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, etc.) with a chosen [[electric charge]] will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layers designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199|bibcode=2015PTEP.2015e3C02A }}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Batmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTime projection chambers:wiki links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}
