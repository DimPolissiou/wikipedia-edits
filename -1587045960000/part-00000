In his ''Nature'' letter, Benveniste also implied that Randi was attempting to hoodwink the experimental run by doing magic tricks, \"distracting the technician in charge of its supervision!\" He was more apologetic on ''Quirks and Quarks'', re-phrasing his mention of Randi to imply that he had kept the team ''amused'' with his tricks and that his presence was generally welcomed. He also pointed out that although it was true two of his team members were being paid by a homeopathic company, the same company had paid Maddox's team's hotel bill.\n\nMaddox was unapologetic, stating \"I'm sorry we didn't find something more interesting.\" On the same ''Quirks and Quarks'' show he dismissed Benveniste's complaints, stating that because of the possibility that the results would be unduly promoted by the homeopathy community, an immediate re-test was necessary. The failure of the tests demonstrated that the initial results were likely due to the [[Observer-expectancy effect|experimenter effect]].

In an editorial, the editor of ''Homeopathy'',  [[Peter Fisher (physician)|Peter Fisher]], acknowledged that Benveniste\u2019s original method does not yield reproducible results and declared  \"...the memory of water is a bad memory: it casts a long shadow over homeopathy and is just about all that many scientists recall about the scientific investigation of homeopathy, equating it with poor or even fraudulent science.\"  The issue was an attempt to restore some credibility to the notion with articles proposing various, very different theories of water memory, such as: electromagnetic exchange of information between molecules, breaking of temporal symmetry, thermoluminescence, entanglement described by a new quantum theory, formation of hydrogen peroxide, clathrate formation, etc. Some of the proposed mechanisms would require overthrowing much of 20th century physics.<ref name=\"Homeopathy2007\">{{citation\n | editor = Martin Chaplin\n | date = 2007\n | title = The Memory of Water ''Homeopathy'' 96:141-230}} \n::Copies of the articles in this special issue are freely available on a private website, along with discussion.

The failure of the tests demonstrated that the initial results were likely due to the [[Observer-expectancy effect|experimenter effect]].

By contrast, the notion of \"memory of water\" has been taken seriously among [[homeopathy|homeopaths]]. For them, it seemed to be part of a possible explanation of why some of their remedies might work. \nAn overview of the issues surrounding the memory of water was the subject of a special issue of ''Homeopathy.'' In an editorial, the editor of ''Homeopathy'',  [[Peter_Fisher_(physician)|Peter Fisher]], acknowledged that Benveniste\u2019s original method does not yield reproducible results and declared  \"...the memory of water is a bad memory: it casts a long shadow over homeopathy and is just about all that many scientists recall about the scientific investigation of homeopathy, equating it with poor or even fraudulent science.\"  The issue was an attempt to restore some credibility to the notion with articles proposing various, very different theories of water memory, such as: electromagnetic exchange of information between molecules, breaking of temporal symmetry, thermoluminescence, entanglement described by a new quantum theory, formation of hydrogen peroxide, clathrate formation, etc. Some of the proposed mechanisms would require overthrowing much of 20th century physics.<ref name=\"Homeopathy2007\">{{citation\n | editor = Martin Chaplin\n | date = 2007\n | title = The Memory of Water ''Homeopathy'' 96:141-230}} \n::Copies of the articles in this special issue are freely available on a private website, along with discussion.

This was in the wake of their 1st Round elimination from the [[Football League Cup]] in August, having lost 1-2 at home to [[Football League Championship]] side [[Cardiff City]].\n\n==Review and events==\n\n===Monthly events===\n21 August \u2013 Coventry City return to the Ricoh Arena following thirteen months playing at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]]'s Sixfields Stadium.\n\n==Squad details==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:84.5%; width:101%;\"\n!

He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes.

Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language. Johnson is the subject of several biographies and fictionalised portrayals.<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS LONGSTANDING PARAGRAPH WITHOUT DISCUSSING ON TALK PAGE; THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS IS FULLY SOURCED IN ARTICLE BODY. -->\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1964\u20131977===\nJohnson was born on 19 June 1964 in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/b48561749c65479fbadbcdc35808343a |first=Jill |last=Lawless |title=Boris Johnson's Chaotic Path to Power Finally Pays Off |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=23 July 2019 |access-date=31 July 2019 }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=10|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=1}} to 23 year-old [[Stanley Johnson (writer)|Stanley Johnson]], an Englishman, then studying economics at [[Columbia University]],{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=11|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=2}} and his 22-year-old wife of one year [[Charlotte Johnson Wahl|Charlotte Fawcett]],<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news |last=Llewellyn Smith |first=Julia |date=18 May 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/1976150/Boris-Johnson-by-his-mother-Charlotte-Johnson-Wahl.html |title=Boris Johnson, by his mother Charlotte Johnson Wahl |work=The Sunday Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> an Oxford-born artist from a family of liberal intellectuals, and a daughter of Sir [[James Fawcett (barrister)|James Fawcett]], a barrister.
