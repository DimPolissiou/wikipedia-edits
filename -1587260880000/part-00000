An object that absorbs all radiation falling on it, at all [[wavelength]]s, is called a black body. When a black body is at a uniform temperature, its emission has a characteristic frequency distribution that depends on the temperature. Its emission is called black-body radiation.\n\nThe concept of the black body is an idealization, as perfect black bodies do not exist in nature.<ref name=\"Planck 1914 42\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=42}}</ref> [[Graphite]] and [[carbon black|lamp black]], with emissivities greater than 0.95, however, are good approximations to a black material.

The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency, is called the ''black-body curve''. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.\n\n[[Image:Pahoehoe toe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The temperature of a [[Lava#P\u0101hoehoe|P\u0101hoehoe]] lava flow can be estimated by observing its color. The result agrees well with other measurements of temperatures of lava flows at about {{Convert|1000|to|1200|C|F}}.]]\n\nTwo bodies that are at the same temperature stay in mutual thermal equilibrium, so a body at temperature ''T'' surrounded by a cloud of light at temperature ''T'' on average will emit as much light into the cloud as it absorbs, following Prevost's exchange principle, which refers to [[radiative equilibrium]]. The principle of [[detailed balance]] says that in thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally in its forward and backward sense.<ref>de Groot, SR., Mazur, P. (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics'', North-Holland, Amsterdam.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998}}, Section 9.4.</ref> Prevost also showed that the emission from a body is logically determined solely by its own internal state. The causal effect of thermodynamic absorption on thermodynamic (spontaneous) emission is not direct, but is only indirect as it affects the internal state of the body. This means that at thermodynamic equilibrium the amount of every wavelength in every direction of thermal radiation emitted by a body at temperature ''T'', black or not, is equal to the corresponding amount that the body absorbs because it is surrounded by light at temperature ''T''.<ref name=\"Stewart 1858\"/>\n\nWhen the body is black, the absorption is obvious: the amount of light absorbed is all the light that hits the surface. For a black body much bigger than the wavelength, the light energy absorbed at any wavelength ''\u03bb'' per unit time is strictly proportional to the black-body curve. This means that the black-body curve is the amount of light energy emitted by a black body, which justifies the name. This is the  condition for the applicability of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]: the black-body curve is characteristic of thermal light, which depends only on the [[temperature]] of the walls of the cavity, provided that the walls of the cavity are completely opaque and are not very reflective, and that the cavity is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].<ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book |last=Huang |first=Kerson|title=Statistical Mechanics |year=1967 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0-471-81518-7}}</ref> When the black body is small, so that its size is comparable to the wavelength of light, the absorption is modified, because a small object is not an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of strict equality of emission and absorption is always upheld in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nIn the laboratory, black-body radiation is approximated by the radiation from a small hole in a large cavity, a [[hohlraum]], in an entirely opaque body that is only partly reflective, that is maintained at a constant temperature. (This technique leads to the alternative term ''cavity radiation''.) Any light entering the hole would have to reflect off the walls of the cavity multiple times before it escaped, in which process it is nearly certain to be absorbed. Absorption occurs regardless of the [[wavelength]] of the radiation entering (as long as it is small compared to the hole). The hole, then, is a close approximation of a theoretical black body and, if the cavity is heated, the [[Power spectral density|spectrum]] of the hole's radiation (i.e., the amount of light emitted from the hole at each wavelength) will be continuous, and will depend only on the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and at least partly absorptive, but not on the particular material of which they are built nor on the material in the cavity (compare with [[emission spectrum]]).\n\nThe [[radiance]] or observed intensity is not a function of direction. Therefore, a black body is a perfect [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambertian]] radiator.\n\nReal objects never behave as full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted radiation at a given frequency is a fraction of what the ideal emission would be. The [[emissivity]] of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, emission angle, and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface's spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength, so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the ''gray body'' assumption.\n\n[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|300px|9-year [[WMAP]] image (2012) of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] across the universe.<ref name=\"Space-20121221\">{{cite web |last=Gannon |first=Megan |title=New 'Baby Picture' of Universe Unveiled |url=http://www.space.com/19027-universe-baby-picture-wmap.html|date=December 21, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 21, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"arXiv-20121220\">{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=C.L. |last2=Larson |first2=L.|last3=Weiland |first3=J.L. |last4=Jarosk |first4= N. |last5=Hinshaw |first5=N. |last6=Odegard|first6=N. |last7=Smith |first7=K.M. |last8=Hill |first8=R.S. |last9=Gold |first9=B.|last10=Halpern |first10=M. |last11=Komatsu |first11=E. |last12=Nolta |first12=M.R.|last13=Page |first13=L. |last14=Spergel |first14=D.N. |last15=Wollack |first15=E.|last16=Dunkley |first16=J. |last17=Kogut |first17=A. |last18=Limon |first18=M. |last19=Meyer|first19=S.S. |last20=Tucker |first20=G.S. |last21=Wright |first21=E.L. |title=Nine-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Final Maps and Results|volume=1212 |pages=5225 |arxiv=1212.5225 |date=December 20, 2012|bibcode = 2013ApJS..208...20B |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/208/2/20}}</ref>]]\n\nWith non-black surfaces, the deviations from ideal black-body behavior are determined by both the surface structure, such as roughness or granularity, and the chemical composition. On a \"per wavelength\" basis, real objects in states of [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]] still follow [[Kirchhoff's law (thermodynamics)|Kirchhoff's Law]]: emissivity equals absorptivity, so that an object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than an ideal black body; the incomplete absorption can be due to some of the incident light being transmitted through the body or to some of it being reflected at the surface of the body.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], objects such as [[star]]s are frequently regarded as black bodies, though this is often a poor approximation. An almost perfect black-body spectrum is exhibited by the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. [[Hawking radiation]] is the hypothetical black-body radiation emitted by [[black hole]]s, at a temperature that depends on the mass, charge, and spin of the hole.  If this prediction is correct, black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles.\n\nA black body radiates energy at all frequencies, but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies (short wavelengths). For example, a black body at room temperature ({{val|300|u=K}}) with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range (390\u2013750&nbsp;nm) at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, meaning that for most practical purposes, such a black body does not emit in the visible range.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe study of the laws of black bodies and the failure of classical physics to describe them helped establish the foundations of [[history of quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]].\n\n=== Further explanation ===\nAccording to the Classical Theory of Radiation, if each [[Fourier mode]] of the equilibrium radiation (in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls) is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the [[equipartition theorem]] of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode.  Since there are an infinite number of modes, this would imply  infinite [[heat capacity]], as well as a nonphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].\nIn the longer [[Wavelength|wavelengths]] this deviation is not so noticeable, as <math>h \\nu</math> and <math>nh \\nu</math> are very small. In the shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet range, however, classical theory predicts the energy emitted tends to infinity, hence the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].  The theory even predicted that all bodies would emit most of their energy in the ultraviolet range, clearly contradicted by the experimental data which showed a different peak wavelength at different temperatures (see also [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's law]]). [[File:Black body.svg|thumb|303px|As the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. The black-body radiation graph is also compared with the classical model of Rayleigh and Jeans.]]\n\nInstead, in the quantum treatment of this problem, the numbers of the energy  modes are [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]], attenuating the spectrum at high frequency in agreement with experimental observation and resolving the catastrophe.  The modes that had more energy than the thermal energy of the substance itself were not considered, and because of quantization modes having infinitesimally little  energy were excluded.\n\nThus for shorter [[Wavelength|wavelengths]] very few modes (having energy more than <math>h \\nu</math>)  were allowed, supporting the data that the energy emitted is reduced for wavelengths less than the wavelength of the observed peak of emission.\n\nNotice that there are two factors responsible for the shape of the graph. Firstly, longer wavelengths have a larger number of modes associated with them. Secondly, shorter wavelengths have more energy associated per mode. The two factors combined give the characteristic maximum wavelength.\n\nCalculating the black-body curve was a major challenge in [[theoretical physics]] during the late nineteenth century. The problem was solved in 1901 by [[Max Planck]] in the formalism now known as [[Planck's law]] of black-body radiation.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last = Planck\n|first = Max\n|authorlink = Max_Planck\n|title = Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum\n|trans-title = On the law of the distribution of energy in the normal spectrum\n|journal = [[Annalen der Physik]]\n|series = 4th series\n|volume = 4\n|issue = 3\n|pages = 553\u2013563\n|year = 1901\n|url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.yl1bqm;view=1up;seq=583 \n|language = German\n|doi=10.1002/andp.19013090310\n|bibcode=1901AnP...309..553P\n}}</ref> By making changes to [[Wien's radiation law]] (not to be confused with [[Wien's displacement law]]) consistent with [[thermodynamics]] and [[electromagnetism]], he found a mathematical expression fitting the experimental data satisfactorily. Planck had to assume that the energy of the oscillators in the cavity was quantized, i.e., it existed in integer multiples of some quantity. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] built on this idea and proposed the quantization of electromagnetic radiation itself in 1905 to explain the [[photoelectric effect]]. These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the superseding of classical electromagnetism by [[quantum electrodynamics]]. These quanta were called [[photon]]s and the black-body cavity was thought of as containing a [[photon gas|gas of photons]]. In addition, it led to the development of quantum probability distributions, called [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], each applicable to a different class of particles, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.\n\nThe wavelength at which the radiation is strongest is given by Wien's displacement law, and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]. So, as temperature increases, the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue. Even as the peak wavelength moves into the ultra-violet, enough radiation continues to be emitted in the blue wavelengths that the body will continue to appear blue. It will never become invisible\u2014indeed, the radiation of visible light increases [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with temperature.<ref name=\"Landau\">{{cite book |last=Landau |first=L.

Prior to this time, most matter in the universe was in the form of an ionized plasma in thermal, though not full thermodynamic, equilibrium with radiation.\n\nAccording to Kondepudi and Prigogine, at very high temperatures (above 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;K; such temperatures existed in the very early universe), where the thermal motion separates protons and neutrons in spite of the strong nuclear forces, electron-positron pairs appear and disappear spontaneously and are in thermal equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation. These particles form a part of the black body spectrum, in addition to the electromagnetic radiation.<ref>{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998|pages = 227\u2013228}}; also Section 11.6, pages 294\u2013296.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn his first memoir, [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] (1788\u20131827) responded to a view he extracted from a French translation of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Optics]]''. He says that Newton imagined particles of light traversing space uninhibited by the [[Caloric theory|caloric]] medium filling it, and refutes this view (never actually held by Newton) by saying that a black body under illumination would increase indefinitely in heat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |authorlink1=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit00char/page/408 |url-access=registration |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit00char/page/408 408\u20139] }}</ref>\n\n===Balfour Stewart===\nIn 1858, [[Balfour Stewart]] described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, compared with the powers of lamp-black surfaces, at the same temperature.<ref name=\"Stewart 1858\">{{harvnb|Stewart|1858}}</ref> Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of [[Pierre Prevost]] and of [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]. He wrote \"Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power.\" More an experimenter than a logician, Stewart failed to point out that his statement presupposed an abstract general principle: that there exist, either ideally in theory, or really in nature, bodies or surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible absorbing power, likewise for radiating power, for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature.\n\nStewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Stokes-[[Helmholtz reciprocity]] principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.\n\nStewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation, but his mathematics was not rigorously valid.<ref name=\"Siegel\">{{harvnb|Siegel|1976}}</ref> He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of ''[[vis viva]]''. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He did not postulate unrealizable perfectly black surfaces. He concluded that his experiments showed that in a cavity in thermal equilibrium, the heat radiated from any part of the interior bounding surface, no matter of what material it might be composed, was the same as would have been emitted from a surface of the same shape and position that would have been composed of lamp-black. He did not state explicitly that the lamp-black-coated bodies that he used as reference must have had a unique common spectral emittance function that depended on temperature in a unique way.\n\n===Gustav Kirchhoff===\nIn 1859, not knowing of Stewart's work, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]] reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860a}}</ref>\n\nKirchhoff then went on to consider some bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}.\n\nHere is used a notation different from Kirchhoff's. Here, the emitting power {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'')}} denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index {{math|''i''}} at temperature {{math|''T''}}. The total absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature {{math|''T''}} . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart's, Kirchhoff's definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorptivity is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature {{math|''T''}} is denoted by {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by {{math|''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} . Again, the ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorptivity is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.\n\nIn a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860b}}</ref> His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.<ref name=\"Siegel\"/><ref name=\"Schirrmacher 2001\">{{harvnb|Schirrmacher|2001}}</ref> His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorptivity has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} has one and the same value for all bodies, that is for all values of index {{math|''i''}} . In this report there was no mention of black bodies.\n\nIn 1860, still not knowing of Stewart's measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}}, has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index {{math|''i''}}.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref> Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.<ref name=\"Siegel\"/><ref name=\"Schirrmacher 2001\"/>\n\nBut more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of \"perfectly black bodies,\" which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff's law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart's reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck's black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=11}}</ref>\n\nKirchhoff's proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled {{math|''i''}} as well as various perfect black bodies labeled {{math|BB}} . It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . His proof intended to show that the ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was independent of the nature {{math|''i''}} of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.\n\nHis proof first argued that for wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} and at temperature {{math|''T''}}, at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorptivity {{math|''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}} of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorptivity {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB) / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}} is again just {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered, successively, thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was equal to {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}}, which may now be denoted {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}}, a continuous function, dependent only on {{math|''\u03bb''}} at fixed temperature {{math|''T''}}, and an increasing function of {{math|''T''}} at fixed wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}}, at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths, with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures, which does not depend on the nature {{math|''i''}} of the arbitrary non-ideal body. (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing.)\n\nThus [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]] can be stated: ''For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature {{math|T}}, for every wavelength {{math|\u03bb}}, the ratio of emissive power to absorptivity has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by {{math|B<sub>\u03bb</sub> (\u03bb, T)}} .'' (For our notation {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}}, Kirchhoff's original notation was simply {{math|''e''}}.)<ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1950|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1930|page=80}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mihalas|Weibel-Mihalas|1984|page=328}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nKirchhoff announced that the determination of the function {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}} was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. Occasionally by historians that function {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}} has been called \"Kirchhoff's (emission, universal) function,\"<ref>[[Friedrich Paschen|Paschen, F.]] (1896), personal letter cited by {{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=8, 29}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mehra|Rechenberg|1982|pages=26, 28, 31, 39}}</ref> though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff's universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later.<ref name=\"Schirrmacher 2001\"/> Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart's, and in some respects it was so.<ref name=\"Siegel\"/> Kirchhoff's 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's principle]], which is a form of the second law.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1862/1882|page=573}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Helge Kragh, \"Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the \"black-body\" radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859\u20131860.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|page=58}}</ref>\n\n==Doppler effect==\n\nThe [[relativistic Doppler effect]] causes a shift in the frequency ''f'' of light originating from a source that is moving in relation to the observer, so that the wave is observed to have frequency ''f''':\n:<math>f' = f \\frac{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}, </math>\nwhere ''v'' is the velocity of the source in the observer's rest frame, ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer-source direction measured in the reference frame of the source, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].<ref>The Doppler Effect, T. P. Gill, Logos Press, 1965</ref> This can be simplified for the special cases of objects moving directly towards (''\u03b8'' = \u03c0) or away (''\u03b8'' = 0) from the observer, and for speeds much less than ''c''.\n\nThrough Planck's law the temperature spectrum of a black body is proportionally related to the frequency of light and one may substitute the temperature (''T'') for the frequency in this equation.\n\nFor the case of a source moving directly towards or away from the observer, this reduces to\n:<math>T' = T \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}}.</math>\nHere ''v'' > 0 indicates a receding source, and ''v'' < 0 indicates an approaching source.\n\nThis is an important effect in astronomy, where the velocities of stars and galaxies can reach significant fractions of ''c''. An example is found in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], which exhibits a dipole anisotropy from the Earth's motion relative to this black-body radiation field.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bolometer]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Infrared thermometer]]\n* [[Photon polarization]]\n* [[Planck's law]]\n* [[Pyrometry]]\n* [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]]\n* [[Thermography]]\n* [[Sakuma\u2013Hattori equation]]\n* [[Terahertz radiation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n |last1=Chandrasekhar |first1=S.\n |author1-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\n |year=1950\n |title=Radiative Transfer\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n |last1=Goody |first1=R.

An object that absorbs all radiation falling on it, at all [[wavelength]]s, is called a black body. When a black body is at a uniform temperature, its emission has a characteristic frequency distribution that depends on the temperature. Its emission is called black-body radiation.\n\nThe concept of the black body is an idealization, as perfect black bodies do not exist in nature.<ref name=\"Planck 1914 42\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=42}}</ref> [[Graphite]] and [[carbon black|lamp black]], with emissivities greater than 0.95, however, are good approximations to a black material.

The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency, is called the ''black-body curve''. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.\n\n[[Image:Pahoehoe toe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The temperature of a [[Lava#P\u0101hoehoe|P\u0101hoehoe]] lava flow can be estimated by observing its color.

The principle of [[detailed balance]] says that in thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally in its forward and backward sense.<ref>de Groot, SR., Mazur, P. (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics'', North-Holland, Amsterdam.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998}}, Section 9.4.</ref> Prevost also showed that the emission from a body is logically determined solely by its own internal state. The causal effect of thermodynamic absorption on thermodynamic (spontaneous) emission is not direct, but is only indirect as it affects the internal state of the body. This means that at thermodynamic equilibrium the amount of every wavelength in every direction of thermal radiation emitted by a body at temperature ''T'', black or not, is equal to the corresponding amount that the body absorbs because it is surrounded by light at temperature ''T''.<ref name=\"Stewart 1858\"/>\n\nWhen the body is black, the absorption is obvious: the amount of light absorbed is all the light that hits the surface. For a black body much bigger than the wavelength, the light energy absorbed at any wavelength ''\u03bb'' per unit time is strictly proportional to the black-body curve. This means that the black-body curve is the amount of light energy emitted by a black body, which justifies the name. This is the  condition for the applicability of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]: the black-body curve is characteristic of thermal light, which depends only on the [[temperature]] of the walls of the cavity, provided that the walls of the cavity are completely opaque and are not very reflective, and that the cavity is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].<ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book |last=Huang |first=Kerson|title=Statistical Mechanics |year=1967 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0-471-81518-7}}</ref> When the black body is small, so that its size is comparable to the wavelength of light, the absorption is modified, because a small object is not an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of strict equality of emission and absorption is always upheld in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nIn the laboratory, black-body radiation is approximated by the radiation from a small hole in a large cavity, a [[hohlraum]], in an entirely opaque body that is only partly reflective, that is maintained at a constant temperature. (This technique leads to the alternative term ''cavity radiation''.) Any light entering the hole would have to reflect off the walls of the cavity multiple times before it escaped, in which process it is nearly certain to be absorbed. Absorption occurs regardless of the [[wavelength]] of the radiation entering (as long as it is small compared to the hole). The hole, then, is a close approximation of a theoretical black body and, if the cavity is heated, the [[Power spectral density|spectrum]] of the hole's radiation (i.e., the amount of light emitted from the hole at each wavelength) will be continuous, and will depend only on the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and at least partly absorptive, but not on the particular material of which they are built nor on the material in the cavity (compare with [[emission spectrum]]).\n\nThe [[radiance]] or observed intensity is not a function of direction. Therefore, a black body is a perfect [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambertian]] radiator.\n\nReal objects never behave as full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted radiation at a given frequency is a fraction of what the ideal emission would be. The [[emissivity]] of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, emission angle, and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface's spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength, so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the ''gray body'' assumption.\n\n[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|300px|9-year [[WMAP]] image (2012) of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] across the universe.<ref name=\"Space-20121221\">{{cite web |last=Gannon |first=Megan |title=New 'Baby Picture' of Universe Unveiled |url=http://www.space.com/19027-universe-baby-picture-wmap.html|date=December 21, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 21, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"arXiv-20121220\">{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=C.L. |last2=Larson |first2=L.|last3=Weiland |first3=J.L. |last4=Jarosk |first4= N. |last5=Hinshaw |first5=N. |last6=Odegard|first6=N. |last7=Smith |first7=K.M. |last8=Hill |first8=R.S. |last9=Gold |first9=B.|last10=Halpern |first10=M. |last11=Komatsu |first11=E. |last12=Nolta |first12=M.R.|last13=Page |first13=L. |last14=Spergel |first14=D.N. |last15=Wollack |first15=E.|last16=Dunkley |first16=J. |last17=Kogut |first17=A. |last18=Limon |first18=M. |last19=Meyer|first19=S.S. |last20=Tucker |first20=G.S. |last21=Wright |first21=E.L. |title=Nine-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Final Maps and Results|volume=1212 |pages=5225 |arxiv=1212.5225 |date=December 20, 2012|bibcode = 2013ApJS..208...20B |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/208/2/20}}</ref>]]\n\nWith non-black surfaces, the deviations from ideal black-body behavior are determined by both the surface structure, such as roughness or granularity, and the chemical composition. On a \"per wavelength\" basis, real objects in states of [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]] still follow [[Kirchhoff's law (thermodynamics)|Kirchhoff's Law]]: emissivity equals absorptivity, so that an object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than an ideal black body; the incomplete absorption can be due to some of the incident light being transmitted through the body or to some of it being reflected at the surface of the body.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], objects such as [[star]]s are frequently regarded as black bodies, though this is often a poor approximation. An almost perfect black-body spectrum is exhibited by the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. [[Hawking radiation]] is the hypothetical black-body radiation emitted by [[black hole]]s, at a temperature that depends on the mass, charge, and spin of the hole.  If this prediction is correct, black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles.\n\nA black body radiates energy at all frequencies, but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies (short wavelengths). For example, a black body at room temperature ({{val|300|u=K}}) with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range (390\u2013750&nbsp;nm) at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, meaning that for most practical purposes, such a black body does not emit in the visible range.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe study of the laws of black bodies and the failure of classical physics to describe them helped establish the foundations of [[history of quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]].\n\n=== Further explanation ===\nAccording to the Classical Theory of Radiation, if each [[Fourier mode]] of the equilibrium radiation (in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls) is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the [[equipartition theorem]] of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode.  Since there are an infinite number of modes, this would imply  infinite [[heat capacity]], as well as a nonphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].\nIn the longer [[Wavelength|wavelengths]] this deviation is not so noticeable, as <math>h \\nu</math> and <math>nh \\nu</math> are very small. In the shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet range, however, classical theory predicts the energy emitted tends to infinity, hence the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].  The theory even predicted that all bodies would emit most of their energy in the ultraviolet range, clearly contradicted by the experimental data which showed a different peak wavelength at different temperatures (see also [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's law]]). [[File:Black body.svg|thumb|303px|As the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. The black-body radiation graph is also compared with the classical model of Rayleigh and Jeans.]]\n\nInstead, in the quantum treatment of this problem, the numbers of the energy  modes are [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]], attenuating the spectrum at high frequency in agreement with experimental observation and resolving the catastrophe.  The modes that had more energy than the thermal energy of the substance itself were not considered, and because of quantization modes having infinitesimally little  energy were excluded.\n\nThus for shorter [[Wavelength|wavelengths]] very few modes (having energy more than <math>h \\nu</math>)  were allowed, supporting the data that the energy emitted is reduced for wavelengths less than the wavelength of the observed peak of emission.\n\nNotice that there are two factors responsible for the shape of the graph. Firstly, longer wavelengths have a larger number of modes associated with them. Secondly, shorter wavelengths have more energy associated per mode. The two factors combined give the characteristic maximum wavelength.\n\nCalculating the black-body curve was a major challenge in [[theoretical physics]] during the late nineteenth century. The problem was solved in 1901 by [[Max Planck]] in the formalism now known as [[Planck's law]] of black-body radiation.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last = Planck\n|first = Max\n|authorlink = Max_Planck\n|title = Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum\n|trans-title = On the law of the distribution of energy in the normal spectrum\n|journal = [[Annalen der Physik]]\n|series = 4th series\n|volume = 4\n|issue = 3\n|pages = 553\u2013563\n|year = 1901\n|url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.yl1bqm;view=1up;seq=583 \n|language = German\n|doi=10.1002/andp.19013090310\n|bibcode=1901AnP...309..553P\n}}</ref> By making changes to [[Wien's radiation law]] (not to be confused with [[Wien's displacement law]]) consistent with [[thermodynamics]] and [[electromagnetism]], he found a mathematical expression fitting the experimental data satisfactorily. Planck had to assume that the energy of the oscillators in the cavity was quantized, i.e., it existed in integer multiples of some quantity. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] built on this idea and proposed the quantization of electromagnetic radiation itself in 1905 to explain the [[photoelectric effect]]. These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the superseding of classical electromagnetism by [[quantum electrodynamics]]. These quanta were called [[photon]]s and the black-body cavity was thought of as containing a [[photon gas|gas of photons]]. In addition, it led to the development of quantum probability distributions, called [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], each applicable to a different class of particles, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.\n\nThe wavelength at which the radiation is strongest is given by Wien's displacement law, and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]. So, as temperature increases, the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue. Even as the peak wavelength moves into the ultra-violet, enough radiation continues to be emitted in the blue wavelengths that the body will continue to appear blue. It will never become invisible\u2014indeed, the radiation of visible light increases [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with temperature.<ref name=\"Landau\">{{cite book |last=Landau |first=L.

If we know the shape of the spectrum at one temperature, we can calculate the shape at any other temperature. Spectral intensity can be expressed as a function of wavelength or of frequency.\n\nA consequence of Wien's displacement law is that the wavelength at which the intensity ''per unit wavelength'' of the radiation produced by a black body has a local maximum or peak, <math>\\lambda_\\text{peak}</math>, is a function only of the temperature:\n:<math>\\lambda_\\text{peak} = \\frac{b}{T},</math>\nwhere the constant ''b'', known as Wien's displacement constant, is equal to {{val|2.897771955|e=-3|u=m K}}.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Wien wavelength displacement law constant\n|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bwien\n|work=The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty\n|publisher=[[NIST]]\n|accessdate=February 8, 2019\n}}</ref> At a typical room temperature of 293 K (20 \u00b0C), the maximum intensity is at {{val|9.9|u=um}}.\n\nPlanck's law was also stated above as a function of frequency.

Because of this, the planet is hit with only a tiny fraction of it. The power from the Sun that strikes the planet (at the top of the atmosphere) is:\n:<math>P_{\\rm SE} = P_{\\rm S\\ emt} \\left( \\frac{\\pi R_{\\rm E}^2}{4 \\pi D^2} \\right) \\qquad \\qquad (2)</math>\nwhere\n:<math>R_{\\rm E} \\,</math> is the radius of the planet and\n:<math>D \\,</math> is the distance between the [[Sun]] and the planet.\n\nBecause of its high temperature, the Sun emits to a large extent in the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) frequency range. In this frequency range, the planet reflects a fraction <math>\\alpha</math> of this energy where <math>\\alpha</math> is the [[albedo]] or reflectance of the planet in the UV-Vis range. In other words, the planet absorbs a fraction <math>1-\\alpha</math> of the Sun's light, and reflects the rest.

This temperature, calculated for the case of the planet acting as a black body by setting <math>P_{\\rm abs} = P_{\\rm emt\\,bb}</math>, is known as the [[effective temperature]].  The actual temperature of the planet will likely be different, depending on its surface and atmospheric properties.

He wrote \"Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power.\" More an experimenter than a logician, Stewart failed to point out that his statement presupposed an abstract general principle: that there exist, either ideally in theory, or really in nature, bodies or surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible absorbing power, likewise for radiating power, for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature.\n\nStewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Stokes-[[Helmholtz reciprocity]] principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.\n\nStewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation, but his mathematics was not rigorously valid.<ref name=\"Siegel\">{{harvnb|Siegel|1976}}</ref> He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of ''[[vis viva]]''. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He did not postulate unrealizable perfectly black surfaces. He concluded that his experiments showed that in a cavity in thermal equilibrium, the heat radiated from any part of the interior bounding surface, no matter of what material it might be composed, was the same as would have been emitted from a surface of the same shape and position that would have been composed of lamp-black. He did not state explicitly that the lamp-black-coated bodies that he used as reference must have had a unique common spectral emittance function that depended on temperature in a unique way.\n\n===Gustav Kirchhoff===\nIn 1859, not knowing of Stewart's work, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]] reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860a}}</ref>\n\nKirchhoff then went on to consider some bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}.\n\nHere is used a notation different from Kirchhoff's. Here, the emitting power {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'')}} denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index {{math|''i''}} at temperature {{math|''T''}}. The total absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature {{math|''T''}} . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart's, Kirchhoff's definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorptivity is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature {{math|''T''}} is denoted by {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by {{math|''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} . Again, the ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorptivity is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.\n\nIn a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860b}}</ref> His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.<ref name=\"Siegel\"/><ref name=\"Schirrmacher 2001\">{{harvnb|Schirrmacher|2001}}</ref> His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorptivity has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} has one and the same value for all bodies, that is for all values of index {{math|''i''}} . In this report there was no mention of black bodies.\n\nIn 1860, still not knowing of Stewart's measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}}, has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index {{math|''i''}}.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref> Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.<ref name=\"Siegel\"/><ref name=\"Schirrmacher 2001\"/>\n\nBut more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of \"perfectly black bodies,\" which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff's law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart's reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck's black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=11}}</ref>\n\nKirchhoff's proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled {{math|''i''}} as well as various perfect black bodies labeled {{math|BB}} . It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . His proof intended to show that the ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was independent of the nature {{math|''i''}} of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.\n\nHis proof first argued that for wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} and at temperature {{math|''T''}}, at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorptivity {{math|''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}} of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorptivity {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB) / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}} is again just {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered, successively, thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was equal to {{math|''E''(''\u03bb'', ''T'', BB)}}, which may now be denoted {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}}, a continuous function, dependent only on {{math|''\u03bb''}} at fixed temperature {{math|''T''}}, and an increasing function of {{math|''T''}} at fixed wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}}, at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths, with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures, which does not depend on the nature {{math|''i''}} of the arbitrary non-ideal body. (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing.)\n\nThus [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]] can be stated: ''For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature {{math|T}}, for every wavelength {{math|\u03bb}}, the ratio of emissive power to absorptivity has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by {{math|B<sub>\u03bb</sub> (\u03bb, T)}} .'' (For our notation {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}}, Kirchhoff's original notation was simply {{math|''e''}}.)<ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1950|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1930|page=80}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mihalas|Weibel-Mihalas|1984|page=328}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nKirchhoff announced that the determination of the function {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}} was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. Occasionally by historians that function {{math|''B''<sub>''\u03bb''</sub> (''\u03bb'', ''T'')}} has been called \"Kirchhoff's (emission, universal) function,\"<ref>[[Friedrich Paschen|Paschen, F.]] (1896), personal letter cited by {{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=8, 29}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mehra|Rechenberg|1982|pages=26, 28, 31, 39}}</ref> though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff's universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later.<ref name=\"Schirrmacher 2001\"/> Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart's, and in some respects it was so.<ref name=\"Siegel\"/> Kirchhoff's 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's principle]], which is a form of the second law.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1862/1882|page=573}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Helge Kragh, \"Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the \"black-body\" radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859\u20131860.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|page=58}}</ref>\n\n==Doppler effect==\n\nThe [[relativistic Doppler effect]] causes a shift in the frequency ''f'' of light originating from a source that is moving in relation to the observer, so that the wave is observed to have frequency ''f''':\n:<math>f' = f \\frac{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}, </math>\nwhere ''v'' is the velocity of the source in the observer's rest frame, ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer-source direction measured in the reference frame of the source, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].<ref>The Doppler Effect, T. P. Gill, Logos Press, 1965</ref> This can be simplified for the special cases of objects moving directly towards (''\u03b8'' = \u03c0) or away (''\u03b8'' = 0) from the observer, and for speeds much less than ''c''.\n\nThrough Planck's law the temperature spectrum of a black body is proportionally related to the frequency of light and one may substitute the temperature (''T'') for the frequency in this equation.\n\nFor the case of a source moving directly towards or away from the observer, this reduces to\n:<math>T' = T \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}}.</math>\nHere ''v'' > 0 indicates a receding source, and ''v'' < 0 indicates an approaching source.\n\nThis is an important effect in astronomy, where the velocities of stars and galaxies can reach significant fractions of ''c''. An example is found in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], which exhibits a dipole anisotropy from the Earth's motion relative to this black-body radiation field.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bolometer]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Infrared thermometer]]\n* [[Photon polarization]]\n* [[Planck's law]]\n* [[Pyrometry]]\n* [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]]\n* [[Thermography]]\n* [[Sakuma\u2013Hattori equation]]\n* [[Terahertz radiation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n |last1=Chandrasekhar |first1=S.\n |author1-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\n |year=1950\n |title=Radiative Transfer\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n |last1=Goody |first1=R.

The ground is owned by [[Northern Beaches Council]] and is primarily used by the [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]] [[rugby league]] team. Brookvale Oval has an approximate capacity of 21,000 people. By the end of the 2019 season, Brookvale had played host to 695 first grade premiership games.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nIn the late nineteenth century, the suburb of [[Brookvale, New South Wales|Brookvale]] was known as Greendale. The name Brookvale was later adopted as that was the name of the home built by the original grantee of the land, William Francis Parker. It was in this area that Dan Farrell built his stone house called \"Inverness\" which was later to become Manly Leagues Club.\n\nThe area known as Lot 47 A (Land Titles Office Vol. 1524 Fol. 122) was sold to Jane Malcolm in April 1907. Land title records suggest that between 1907 and 1911, Malcolm carried out a subdivision of Lot 47A into four blocks. From Alfred Road in the west to Pine Avenue in the east, these lots respectively measured 2 acres 2 roods 12 perches, 4 acres 1 rood 4{{fraction|1|4}} perches, 2 acres 0 roods 22{{fraction|1|4}} perches and 2 acres 0 roods & 2 perches. Lot 47A became known in the early 1900s as \"Farrell\u2019s Paddock\",<ref>Dan Farrell was the first president of the Manly-Warringah Tramway League.</ref> and it was the location of a public gathering in April 1910 to celebrate the extension of the tram line from Manly to the village of Brookvale.<ref>Mayne-Wilson & Associates (2005). Heritage Report on Brookvale Park Pittwater Road, Brookvale. Dee Why: Warringah Council</ref>\n\nIn the following year, the State Government reached agreement with [[Warringah Shire]] Council to acquire land for a park near the Shire's Offices. The acquired land plus a smaller parcel of land bought from Miss Jane Malcolm (later known as Jane Try) from Brookvale, was officially opened in 1911 as Brookvale Park.  \"Presumably inspired by local resident action at that time to secure a public park or village green for the suburb, Jane Malcolm presented to the Minister for Lands the largest of the four lots from Lot 47A (the lot measuring 4 acres 1 rood 4{{fraction|1|4}} perches) \u2013 under a caveat that it only ever be used for public recreation purposes. Although the \u2018dedication\u2019 refers strictly to the first lot of land donated by Jane Try, subsequent acquisitions by Council of the other lots owned by Mr & Mrs Try were described specifically for the purposes of public recreation or for enlarging the Park\"<ref>Mayne-Wilson & Associates (2005).</ref>\n\nThe Park was transformed into a showground within the first decade. In 1921, the Brookvale Show was established with the formation of the Warringah Agricultural, Horticultural, Amateur Sports and Athletic Association. Between 1919 and 1928 children from Brookvale School planted trees to commemorate Arbor Day and it was the setting for school sports days and Empire Day picnics.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Brookvale Park was utilised by the Defence Force for training purposes.\n\n=== Since WWII ===\nOn 25 April 1951, a new attendance record at Brookvale was set at 9,447, with spectators overflowing onto the field for a match between Manly and South Sydney.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Goodman\n  | first = Tom\n  | title = Manly disputes penalty try by Graves\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | page = 8\n  | date = 1951-04-26\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130124214524/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archive-date = 2013-01-24\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref>\n\nOver fifty annual shows were held at Brookvale Park before the show was moved to St Ives Showground. Trotting and ring events were features of early shows at Brookvale. The trotting track occupied a substantial area of the Park with lighting of the ring for night entertainment. Substantial improvements were later made to form a sporting oval by the addition of stands. Pavilions were constructed along Alfred Road to house show exhibits. Outside of the annual show period these pavilions were used for local church services and meeting rooms for the local community. They were also used by local bands as a place to practice.\n\n'With the formation of the Manly-Warringah Rugby Club, known as the Sea Eagles, however, the situation changed. The horse events of the Show had to be transferred to an oval in Frenchs Forest because the horses\u2019 hooves did too much damage to the turf of the rugby ground, and the Show itself ended its long association with the Park in 1992. The growth in popularity of the Rugby League competition led to the re-forming of the oval into a rectangular field in 1970\u201371, with major earthworks undertaken to form spectator \u2018hills\u2019 on the eastern and southern sides of it. Following this came the construction of simple but large concrete grandstands on the western and southern boundaries of the field, and finally the [[Ken Arthurson]] Pavilion that linked the two. The construction of these facilities necessitated the removal of the original grandstand and the various exhibition halls and show pavilion, and with that, the termination of their use by community organisations and their hiring out for social functions'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/manly-daily/equestrian-events-and-sideshows-made-way-for-rugby-league/news-story/dbbe10d688b1f12010a0b38648edf92c|title=Brookvale Park a showground|last=Morcombe|first=John|date=2016-11-04|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nWhile Manly Council favoured rugby union and would not permit league to be played at Manly Oval, Warringah Council was more sympathetic to the rugby league cause and encouraged the playing of rugby league matches at Brookvale Park. Thus when the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] were granted first grade status in [[1947 NSWRFL season|1947]], the team's first match in the big league was a home game at Brookvale Oval against [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] in April 12. Manly, captained by [[Max Whitehead]] and featuring others such as [[Johnny Bliss]] and Mackie Campbell (the grandfather of Manly's all-time leading try scorer [[Steve Menzies]]), played well against their more fancied opponents in that historic first match at Brookvale scoring three tries to one but narrowly losing the match 15-13 courtesy of a string of scrum penalties from referee Aub Oxford that allowed Wests fullback [[Bill Keato]] to kick six goals.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrfl-1947/round-1/manly-warringah-vs-western-suburbs/summary.html 1947 Manly vs Wests]</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, before the finals series, Manly's elimination home final against Cronulla was almost moved after traces of asbestos were reportedly found at the ground. The game went ahead after inspectors gave it the all clear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-2019-finals-sea-eagles-vs-sharks-asbestos-lottoland-des-hasler-joke/news-story/aad9bc297a0023a0e9695593dbccb6d8/|title=Lottoland Des Hasler joke|website=news.com.au}}</ref>\n\n== Layout and use ==\nBrookvale has three grandstands stretching the western and southern sides of the ground. The [[Jane Try]] Stand, running along the western side is the biggest of the three. It is also one of the few grandstands of major Australian stadiums to be named after a woman. The [[Ken Arthurson]] stand in the south west corner, is the latest addition to the ground. It is named after the long serving Manly-Warringah, NSWRL and ARL administrator who is known as the \"Godfather of Manly\". The [[Bob Fulton|Fulton]]-[[Steve Menzies|Menzies]] Stand located at the southern end of the ground is elevated with standing room underneath. Originally just referred to as the Southern Stand, it was renamed after two Sea Eagles club legends, Bob \"Bozo\" Fulton and Steve \"Beaver\" Menzies. At the time of the stands renaming, Menzies and Fulton held the club try scoring records with 180 and 129 respectively, though Fulton's record was surpassed by fullback [[Brett Stewart (rugby league)|Brett Stewart]] in [[2013 NRL season|2013]]. A large hill runs along the eastern and northern sides. The ground's capacity is around the 23,000 mark.\n\n== Funding ==\nAs the major stakeholder and leasee of the park, Manly-Warringah Football Club launched a \"Save Brookie\" campaign, aimed at government funding for improvement to the facilities including seating, accessibility, improved safety, corporate boxes and construction of another stand, likely behind the Eastern Hill. The Warringah Council (Local Government) initially pledged funding of $4 million dependent on further grants from State and Federal Governments.  The NSW State Government provided a further grant of $6 million in June 2008, and the club has restated its aim for a further $6 to $10 million from the Federal Government.\n\nOn 6 August 2013, the Federal Government announced a grant of $10 million regardless of the outcome of the 2013 Federal Election. This money is part of a planned $30 million upgrade of the oval which will include a new 4,350 seat grandstand complete with corporate facilities on the eastern hill, as well as upgrades to the Fulton-Menzies Stand. Family Hill (northern hill) is expected to remain as it is and the grounds capacity is expected to remain at around 23,000 when the planned re-development is finished.<ref>[http://www.seaeagles.com.au/news-display/Funding-boost-for-Brookvale-Oval-project/81186 Brookvale Oval $10m Government Grant - 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224438/http://www.seaeagles.com.au/news-display/Funding-boost-for-Brookvale-Oval-project/81186 |date=21 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2017 a 3-year $1 million naming rights deal with [[Lottoland]], renamed Brookvale Oval to \"Lottoland\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/03/brookvale-oval-to-be-renamed-lottoland-as-manly-look-to-nrl-future|title=Brookvale Oval to be renamed 'Lottoland' as Manly look to NRL future|last=Press|first=Australian Associated|date=2017-02-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In August 2019 Lottoland group exercised its option to extend the sponsorship contract, worth $500,000 for another year to the end of the 2020 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/lottoland-court-win-just-the-ticket-for-manly-sponsorship-20190818-p52ic0.html|title=Lottoland court win just the ticket for Manly sponsorship|last=Hatch|first=Patrick|date=2019-08-18|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019 it was announced Brookvale Oval would receive a $36.1 million facelift including a 3000-seat grandstand and centre of excellence after securing a NSW government grant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-backs-away-from-finals-threat-but-many-battles-ahead-for-brookie-20190902-p52n87.html|title=NRL backs away from finals threat, but many battles ahead for Brookie|last=Webster|first=Andrew|date=2019-09-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n== Attendance ==\nThe single record attendance for any event at Brookvale was set during a regular season clash between the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and [[Parramatta Eels]] on 31 August 1986 which drew 27,655 fans. Given changes to the configuration of the ground undertaken in the 1990s it is unlikely that this record will ever be broken. The game is officially declared sold out when crowds creep around the 20-22 000 mark, although no official cut-off is continuously used.\n\nIn 2006, the ground saw its largest average attendance over an entire season, with an average of 15,484 patrons watching each of the club's 11 matches played there. Since the club started playing in 1947, over seven million spectators have visited the ground.\n\nIn 2013, the ground was marred by claims of racism and aggressive behaviour by fans, including recent taunting and racist slurs towards the wife and young daughter of Kiwis and Bulldogs forward [[Frank Pritchard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/ipad-editors-picks/8820786/Pritchards-disturbed-by-racial-abuse-at-Manly|title=Pritchards disturbed by racial abuse at Manly|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\nThe largest known attendance per decade at Brookvale Oval are as follows:\n* 1947-49  -  3,600* - Manly vs [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]], Round 6, [[1947 NSWRFL season|1947]]\n* 1950-59  -  10,908* - Manly vs [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]], Round 6, [[1958 NSWRFL season|1958]]\n* 1960-69  -  13,644 - Manly vs [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], Round 1, [[1964 NSWRFL season|1964]]\n* 1970-79  -  25,876 - Manly vs Balmain, Round 11, [[1976 NSWRFL season|1976]]\n* 1980-89  -  27,655 - Manly vs [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]], Round 26, [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]]\n* 1990-99  -  26,168 - Manly vs [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]], Round 22, [[1994 NSWRL season|1994]]\n* 2000-09  -  20,163 - Manly vs [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]], Round 25, [[2006 NRL season|2006]]\n* 2010-19  -  20,510 - Manly vs [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]], Round 7, [[2013 NRL season|2013]]\n*2020-29 - 10,315 - Manly vs [[Melbourne Storm|Melbourne]], Round 1, [[2020 NRL season|2020]]\n\n<small>''* Attendance records for most games played at Brookvale Oval not known from 1947-56.''</small>\n\n==Top 10 Attendances==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

The Jane Try stand houses those season-ticket holders of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and is located on the western side of the ground. The Jane Try Stand opened in 1971 and was built at a cost of $250,000.\n\nThe second grandstand addition to Brookvale Oval was the Southern Stand built in 1979, located at the Southern end of the ground. The Southern Stand houses some corporate facilities. This stand was renamed at the end of the 2008 season. It became the Fulton-Menzies Stand after club legends [[Bob Fulton]] and [[Steve Menzies]].\n\nThe most recent structural addition to the ground is the [[Ken Arthurson]] Stand. The stand was officially opened on Sunday 14 June 1995. It was built at a cost of $3.3 million and seats 1,250 people. The stand is named for the greatest administrator in the club's history and contains corporate boxes as well as reserved seating for fans. The Ken Arthurson Stand is located in the south-western corner of the ground between the Jane Try and Fulton-Menzies stands. In its early days it was often referred to as the link stand as it linked the two grandstands at the ground.\n\nThere is some limited general admission seating around the perimeter concourse of the ground with a depth of between 3 and 5 rows. Other general admission areas include the Eastern Hill, which spans the length of the eastern side of the ground, and the Scoreboard Hill (Family Hill) which is located is the behind underneath the scoreboard and temporary replay screen.\n\nGround improvements over the off-season following the 2011 premiership win, included extending of the Jane Try Stand to run the full length of the western touchline and the inclusion of corporate facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://silvertails.net/threads/brookvale-ovals-new-stand-held-up-over-the-line.29933/|title=Brookvale Oval's new stand held up over the line|website=Silvertails, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles Supporter forums|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Delays in the completion of these works forced the Sea Eagles to play away for the first 5 games of the 2012 season.<ref>{{Citation|title=Sea Eagles Return to Brookvale|url=https://www.seaeagles.com.au/news/2012/04/12/sea-eagles-return-to-brookvale/|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\n=== Rugby union ===\nIn 2014, the [[North Harbour Rays]] announced Brookvale Oval as their home ground for the inaugural [[National Rugby Championship]] season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/sport/new-north-harbour-rays-rugby-team-to-play-at-brookvale/news-story/7313f79ac8d5449f3b76eac2f51b2e55|title=New rugby team to play at Brookie|date=2014-06-24|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[NSW Waratahs]] played their 2019 season opener [[Super Rugby]] game against [[Hurricanes (rugby union)|New Zealand's Hurricanes]] on 16 February 2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12204505|title=2019 Super Rugby: Hurricanes hang on to beat Waratahs|last=Richardson|first=Daniel|date=2019-02-16|access-date=2019-09-18|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref> and attracted a sellout 17,111 crowd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5908129/record-breaker-foley-blows-chance-for-nsw/|title=Record breaker Foley blows chance for NSW|last=Warren|first=Adrian|date=2019-02-16|website=The Courier|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> The Waratahs played preseason matches at Brookvale Oval against the [[Highlanders (rugby union)|New Zealand's Highlanders]] in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/super-rugby-2017-waratahs-lose-5047-in-thrilling-trial-against-highlanders-20170216-guew9j.html|title=Super Rugby 2017: Waratahs lose 50-47 in thrilling trial against Highlanders|last=Decent|first=Tom|date=2017-02-16|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> and the [[Melbourne Rebels]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/manly-daily/sport/nsw-waratahs-to-play-rebels-at-brookvale-oval/news-story/461cea1c36ea55eae1ef24a51215f3a0|title=NSW Waratahs to play at Brookie|date=2017-12-05|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Soccer ===\nIn June 2014, [[A-League]] club [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] announced its intention to play at least one home game per season at Brookvale Oval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/centralcoastmariners/news-display/News--Mariners-to-start-season-10-with-F3-Derby/90819 |title=Mariners to start Season 10 with F3 Derby |publisher=[[Football Federation Australia]] |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=3 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707013121/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/centralcoastmariners/news-display/News--Mariners-to-start-season-10-with-F3-Derby/90819 |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> The Mariners scheduled the 2014-15 round 16 match against [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] at Brookvale Oval, however it was relocated to the Mariners normal home ground [[Central Coast Stadium]] due to the poor condition of the grass at Brookvale Oval.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/mariners-brookvale-fixture-moved-gosford</ref>\n\n== Playing surface ==\nBrookvale Oval turf cover is predominantly [[Kikuyu grass]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brookvale Oval Investigation|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/33260460/brookvale-oval-investigation-warringah-council-nsw-government/7|website=Yumpu|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2019 Northern Beaches Council CEO Ray Brownlee said \"Council is committed to providing as safe a playing surface as possible at Brookvale Oval and has continued to invest around $160,000 each year in its ongoing maintenance\".

The ground is owned by [[Northern Beaches Council]] and is primarily used by the [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]] [[rugby league]] team. Brookvale Oval has an approximate capacity of 21,000 people. By the end of the 2019 season, Brookvale had played host to 695 first grade premiership games.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nIn the late nineteenth century, the suburb of [[Brookvale, New South Wales|Brookvale]] was known as Greendale. The name Brookvale was later adopted as that was the name of the home built by the original grantee of the land, William Francis Parker. It was in this area that Dan Farrell built his stone house called \"Inverness\" which was later to become Manly Leagues Club.\n\nThe area known as Lot 47 A (Land Titles Office Vol. 1524 Fol. 122) was sold to Jane Malcolm in April 1907. Land title records suggest that between 1907 and 1911, Malcolm carried out a subdivision of Lot 47A into four blocks. From Alfred Road in the west to Pine Avenue in the east, these lots respectively measured 2 acres 2 roods 12 perches, 4 acres 1 rood 4{{fraction|1|4}} perches, 2 acres 0 roods 22{{fraction|1|4}} perches and 2 acres 0 roods & 2 perches. Lot 47A became known in the early 1900s as \"Farrell\u2019s Paddock\",<ref>Dan Farrell was the first president of the Manly-Warringah Tramway League.</ref> and it was the location of a public gathering in April 1910 to celebrate the extension of the tram line from Manly to the village of Brookvale.<ref>Mayne-Wilson & Associates (2005). Heritage Report on Brookvale Park Pittwater Road, Brookvale. Dee Why: Warringah Council</ref>\n\nIn the following year, the State Government reached agreement with [[Warringah Shire]] Council to acquire land for a park near the Shire's Offices. The acquired land plus a smaller parcel of land bought from Miss Jane Malcolm (later known as Jane Try) from Brookvale, was officially opened in 1911 as Brookvale Park.  \"Presumably inspired by local resident action at that time to secure a public park or village green for the suburb, Jane Malcolm presented to the Minister for Lands the largest of the four lots from Lot 47A (the lot measuring 4 acres 1 rood 4{{fraction|1|4}} perches) \u2013 under a caveat that it only ever be used for public recreation purposes. Although the \u2018dedication\u2019 refers strictly to the first lot of land donated by Jane Try, subsequent acquisitions by Council of the other lots owned by Mr & Mrs Try were described specifically for the purposes of public recreation or for enlarging the Park\"<ref>Mayne-Wilson & Associates (2005).</ref>\n\nThe Park was transformed into a showground within the first decade. In 1921, the Brookvale Show was established with the formation of the Warringah Agricultural, Horticultural, Amateur Sports and Athletic Association. Between 1919 and 1928 children from Brookvale School planted trees to commemorate Arbor Day and it was the setting for school sports days and Empire Day picnics.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Brookvale Park was utilised by the Defence Force for training purposes.\n\n=== Since WWII ===\nOn 25 April 1951, a new attendance record at Brookvale was set at 9,447, with spectators overflowing onto the field for a match between Manly and South Sydney.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Goodman\n  | first = Tom\n  | title = Manly disputes penalty try by Graves\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | page = 8\n  | date = 1951-04-26\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130124214524/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archive-date = 2013-01-24\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref>\n\nOver fifty annual shows were held at Brookvale Park before the show was moved to St Ives Showground. Trotting and ring events were features of early shows at Brookvale. The trotting track occupied a substantial area of the Park with lighting of the ring for night entertainment. Substantial improvements were later made to form a sporting oval by the addition of stands. Pavilions were constructed along Alfred Road to house show exhibits. Outside of the annual show period these pavilions were used for local church services and meeting rooms for the local community. They were also used by local bands as a place to practice.\n\n'With the formation of the Manly-Warringah Rugby Club, known as the Sea Eagles, however, the situation changed. The horse events of the Show had to be transferred to an oval in Frenchs Forest because the horses\u2019 hooves did too much damage to the turf of the rugby ground, and the Show itself ended its long association with the Park in 1992. The growth in popularity of the Rugby League competition led to the re-forming of the oval into a rectangular field in 1970\u201371, with major earthworks undertaken to form spectator \u2018hills\u2019 on the eastern and southern sides of it. Following this came the construction of simple but large concrete grandstands on the western and southern boundaries of the field, and finally the [[Ken Arthurson]] Pavilion that linked the two. The construction of these facilities necessitated the removal of the original grandstand and the various exhibition halls and show pavilion, and with that, the termination of their use by community organisations and their hiring out for social functions'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/manly-daily/equestrian-events-and-sideshows-made-way-for-rugby-league/news-story/dbbe10d688b1f12010a0b38648edf92c|title=Brookvale Park a showground|last=Morcombe|first=John|date=2016-11-04|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nWhile Manly Council favoured rugby union and would not permit league to be played at Manly Oval, Warringah Council was more sympathetic to the rugby league cause and encouraged the playing of rugby league matches at Brookvale Park. Thus when the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] were granted first grade status in [[1947 NSWRFL season|1947]], the team's first match in the big league was a home game at Brookvale Oval against [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] in April 12. Manly, captained by [[Max Whitehead]] and featuring others such as [[Johnny Bliss]] and Mackie Campbell (the grandfather of Manly's all-time leading try scorer [[Steve Menzies]]), played well against their more fancied opponents in that historic first match at Brookvale scoring three tries to one but narrowly losing the match 15-13 courtesy of a string of scrum penalties from referee Aub Oxford that allowed Wests fullback [[Bill Keato]] to kick six goals.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrfl-1947/round-1/manly-warringah-vs-western-suburbs/summary.html 1947 Manly vs Wests]</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, before the finals series, Manly's elimination home final against Cronulla was almost moved after traces of asbestos were reportedly found at the ground. The game went ahead after inspectors gave it the all clear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-2019-finals-sea-eagles-vs-sharks-asbestos-lottoland-des-hasler-joke/news-story/aad9bc297a0023a0e9695593dbccb6d8/|title=Lottoland Des Hasler joke|website=news.com.au}}</ref>\n\n== Layout and use ==\nBrookvale has three grandstands stretching the western and southern sides of the ground. The [[Jane Try]] Stand, running along the western side is the biggest of the three. It is also one of the few grandstands of major Australian stadiums to be named after a woman. The [[Ken Arthurson]] stand in the south west corner, is the latest addition to the ground. It is named after the long serving Manly-Warringah, NSWRL and ARL administrator who is known as the \"Godfather of Manly\". The [[Bob Fulton|Fulton]]-[[Steve Menzies|Menzies]] Stand located at the southern end of the ground is elevated with standing room underneath. Originally just referred to as the Southern Stand, it was renamed after two Sea Eagles club legends, Bob \"Bozo\" Fulton and Steve \"Beaver\" Menzies. At the time of the stands renaming, Menzies and Fulton held the club try scoring records with 180 and 129 respectively, though Fulton's record was surpassed by fullback [[Brett Stewart (rugby league)|Brett Stewart]] in [[2013 NRL season|2013]]. A large hill runs along the eastern and northern sides. The ground's capacity is around the 23,000 mark.\n\n== Funding ==\nAs the major stakeholder and leasee of the park, Manly-Warringah Football Club launched a \"Save Brookie\" campaign, aimed at government funding for improvement to the facilities including seating, accessibility, improved safety, corporate boxes and construction of another stand, likely behind the Eastern Hill. The Warringah Council (Local Government) initially pledged funding of $4 million dependent on further grants from State and Federal Governments.  The NSW State Government provided a further grant of $6 million in June 2008, and the club has restated its aim for a further $6 to $10 million from the Federal Government.\n\nOn 6 August 2013, the Federal Government announced a grant of $10 million regardless of the outcome of the 2013 Federal Election. This money is part of a planned $30 million upgrade of the oval which will include a new 4,350 seat grandstand complete with corporate facilities on the eastern hill, as well as upgrades to the Fulton-Menzies Stand. Family Hill (northern hill) is expected to remain as it is and the grounds capacity is expected to remain at around 23,000 when the planned re-development is finished.<ref>[http://www.seaeagles.com.au/news-display/Funding-boost-for-Brookvale-Oval-project/81186 Brookvale Oval $10m Government Grant - 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224438/http://www.seaeagles.com.au/news-display/Funding-boost-for-Brookvale-Oval-project/81186 |date=21 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2017 a 3-year $1 million naming rights deal with [[Lottoland]], renamed Brookvale Oval to \"Lottoland\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/03/brookvale-oval-to-be-renamed-lottoland-as-manly-look-to-nrl-future|title=Brookvale Oval to be renamed 'Lottoland' as Manly look to NRL future|last=Press|first=Australian Associated|date=2017-02-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In August 2019 Lottoland group exercised its option to extend the sponsorship contract, worth $500,000 for another year to the end of the 2020 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/lottoland-court-win-just-the-ticket-for-manly-sponsorship-20190818-p52ic0.html|title=Lottoland court win just the ticket for Manly sponsorship|last=Hatch|first=Patrick|date=2019-08-18|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019 it was announced Brookvale Oval would receive a $36.1 million facelift including a 3000-seat grandstand and centre of excellence after securing a NSW government grant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-backs-away-from-finals-threat-but-many-battles-ahead-for-brookie-20190902-p52n87.html|title=NRL backs away from finals threat, but many battles ahead for Brookie|last=Webster|first=Andrew|date=2019-09-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n== Attendance ==\nThe single record attendance for any event at Brookvale was set during a regular season clash between the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and [[Parramatta Eels]] on 31 August 1986 which drew 27,655 fans. Given changes to the configuration of the ground undertaken in the 1990s it is unlikely that this record will ever be broken. The game is officially declared sold out when crowds creep around the 20-22 000 mark, although no official cut-off is continuously used.\n\nIn 2006, the ground saw its largest average attendance over an entire season, with an average of 15,484 patrons watching each of the club's 11 matches played there. Since the club started playing in 1947, over seven million spectators have visited the ground.\n\nIn 2013, the ground was marred by claims of racism and aggressive behaviour by fans, including recent taunting and racist slurs towards the wife and young daughter of Kiwis and Bulldogs forward [[Frank Pritchard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/ipad-editors-picks/8820786/Pritchards-disturbed-by-racial-abuse-at-Manly|title=Pritchards disturbed by racial abuse at Manly|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\nThe largest known attendance per decade at Brookvale Oval are as follows:\n* 1947-49  -  3,600* - Manly vs [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]], Round 6, [[1947 NSWRFL season|1947]]\n* 1950-59  -  10,908* - Manly vs [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]], Round 6, [[1958 NSWRFL season|1958]]\n* 1960-69  -  13,644 - Manly vs [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], Round 1, [[1964 NSWRFL season|1964]]\n* 1970-79  -  25,876 - Manly vs Balmain, Round 11, [[1976 NSWRFL season|1976]]\n* 1980-89  -  27,655 - Manly vs [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]], Round 26, [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]]\n* 1990-99  -  26,168 - Manly vs [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]], Round 22, [[1994 NSWRL season|1994]]\n* 2000-09  -  20,163 - Manly vs [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]], Round 25, [[2006 NRL season|2006]]\n* 2010-17  -  20,510 - Manly vs [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]], Round 7, [[2013 NRL season|2013]]\n\n<small>''* Attendance records for most games played at Brookvale Oval not known from 1947-56.''</small>\n\n==Top 10 Attendances==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

The Jane Try stand houses those season-ticket holders of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and is located on the western side of the ground. The Jane Try Stand opened in 1971 and was built at a cost of $250,000.\n\nThe second grandstand addition to Brookvale Oval was the Southern Stand built in 1979, located at the Southern end of the ground. The Southern Stand houses some corporate facilities. This stand was renamed at the end of the 2008 season. It became the Fulton-Menzies Stand after club legends [[Bob Fulton]] and [[Steve Menzies]].\n\nThe most recent structural addition to the ground is the [[Ken Arthurson]] Stand. The stand was officially opened on Sunday 14 June 1995. It was built at a cost of $3.3 million and seats 1,250 people. The stand is named for the greatest administrator in the club's history and contains corporate boxes as well as reserved seating for fans. The Ken Arthurson Stand is located in the south-western corner of the ground between the Jane Try and Fulton-Menzies stands. In its early days it was often referred to as the link stand as it linked the two grandstands at the ground.\n\nThere is some limited general admission seating around the perimeter concourse of the ground with a depth of between 3 and 5 rows. Other general admission areas include the Eastern Hill, which spans the length of the eastern side of the ground, and the Scoreboard Hill (Family Hill) which is located is the behind underneath the scoreboard and temporary replay screen.\n\nGround improvements over the off-season following the 2011 premiership win, included extending of the Jane Try Stand to run the full length of the western touchline and the inclusion of corporate facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://silvertails.net/threads/brookvale-ovals-new-stand-held-up-over-the-line.29933/|title=Brookvale Oval's new stand held up over the line|website=Silvertails, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles Supporter forums|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Delays in the completion of these works forced the Sea Eagles to play away for the first 5 games of the 2012 season.<ref>{{Citation|title=Sea Eagles Return to Brookvale|url=https://www.seaeagles.com.au/news/2012/04/12/sea-eagles-return-to-brookvale/|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\n=== Rugby union ===\nIn 2014, the [[North Harbour Rays]] announced Brookvale Oval as their home ground for the inaugural [[National Rugby Championship]] season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/sport/new-north-harbour-rays-rugby-team-to-play-at-brookvale/news-story/7313f79ac8d5449f3b76eac2f51b2e55|title=New rugby team to play at Brookie|date=2014-06-24|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[NSW Waratahs]] played their 2019 season opener [[Super Rugby]] game against [[Hurricanes (rugby union)|New Zealand's Hurricanes]] on 16 February 2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12204505|title=2019 Super Rugby: Hurricanes hang on to beat Waratahs|last=Richardson|first=Daniel|date=2019-02-16|access-date=2019-09-18|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref> and attracted a sellout 17,111 crowd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5908129/record-breaker-foley-blows-chance-for-nsw/|title=Record breaker Foley blows chance for NSW|last=Warren|first=Adrian|date=2019-02-16|website=The Courier|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> The Waratahs played preseason matches at Brookvale Oval against the [[Highlanders (rugby union)|New Zealand's Highlanders]] in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/super-rugby-2017-waratahs-lose-5047-in-thrilling-trial-against-highlanders-20170216-guew9j.html|title=Super Rugby 2017: Waratahs lose 50-47 in thrilling trial against Highlanders|last=Decent|first=Tom|date=2017-02-16|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> and the [[Melbourne Rebels]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/manly-daily/sport/nsw-waratahs-to-play-rebels-at-brookvale-oval/news-story/461cea1c36ea55eae1ef24a51215f3a0|title=NSW Waratahs to play at Brookie|date=2017-12-05|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Soccer ===\nIn June 2014, [[A-League]] club [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] announced its intention to play at least one home game per season at Brookvale Oval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/centralcoastmariners/news-display/News--Mariners-to-start-season-10-with-F3-Derby/90819 |title=Mariners to start Season 10 with F3 Derby |publisher=[[Football Federation Australia]] |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=3 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707013121/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/centralcoastmariners/news-display/News--Mariners-to-start-season-10-with-F3-Derby/90819 |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> The Mariners scheduled the 2014-15 round 16 match against [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] at Brookvale Oval, however it was relocated to the Mariners normal home ground [[Central Coast Stadium]] due to the poor condition of the grass at Brookvale Oval.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/mariners-brookvale-fixture-moved-gosford</ref>\n\n== Playing surface ==\nBrookvale Oval turf cover is predominantly [[Kikuyu grass]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brookvale Oval Investigation|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/33260460/brookvale-oval-investigation-warringah-council-nsw-government/7|website=Yumpu|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2019 Northern Beaches Council CEO Ray Brownlee said \"Council is committed to providing as safe a playing surface as possible at Brookvale Oval and has continued to invest around $160,000 each year in its ongoing maintenance\".
