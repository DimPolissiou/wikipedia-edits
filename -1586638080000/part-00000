{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory General==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==Retired signs==\nNew versions of some pedestrian-related warning signs use a fluorescent green background.

While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory General==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==Retired signs==\nNew versions of some pedestrian-related warning signs use a fluorescent green background.

According to a Khatri legend of the 19th century, they continued their military service until the time of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when the death of many of their number during the emperor's Deccan Campaign caused him to order their [[Women in Hinduism#Widowhood and remarriage|widows to be remarried]]. The order was made out of sympathy for the widows but when the Khatri community leaders refused to obey it, Aurangzeb terminated their military service and said that they should be shopkeepers and brokers.

The speed limit in each location is indicated on a nearby [[traffic sign]] or by the presence of street lighting.  The limits have been posted in [[kilometres per hour]] (km/h) since 1974. Before then, when New Zealand used [[imperial units]], maximum speeds were displayed in miles per hour (mph). Today, limits range from {{convert|10|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|110|km/h|abbr=on}}; in urban areas the default speed limit is {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\n==History==\nA 30 mile (48 kilometre) per hour speed limit was imposed in 1930.

Metric speed limits included the legend \"km/h\" to distinguish them from imperial speed limits; this was dropped from 1987 onwards. Other speed limits were rounded to the nearest ten kilometres per hour, with motorway speed limits being set at 100&nbsp;km/h. Together with the introduction of [[carless days]] in 1979, the maximum speed limit on New Zealand roads was lowered to 80&nbsp;km/h as a fuel saving measure.\n\nEnforcement of New Zealand road speed limits was traditionally done using police \"[[speed trap]]s\" set up and operated by the police.

The Land Transport (Setting of Speed Limits) Rule 2017, which came into force on 24 August 2017, added a provision to set speed limits of {{convert|110|km/h|abbr=on}} on selected motorways and expressways. To be considered for a 110&nbsp;km/h limit, the road must be a dual carriageway, with two lanes in each direction, a median barrier, no at-grade intersections, and no corners rated for a speed below 110&nbsp;km/h. Vehicles subject to a lower maximum speed, such as heavy trucks and towing vehicles, are still subject to that lower limit.{{Citation needed|reason=Various lower limits for towing different types of vehicles with ridged or non-rigid connections|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe first two roads with a 110&nbsp;km/h speed limit were gazetted on 28 November 2017, with the speed limits coming into force on 11 December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2017-au6248|title=New Zealand Transport Agency (Speed Limits on State Highways) Amendment Bylaw 2017/16 - 2017-au6248 - New Zealand Gazette|website=gazette.govt.nz|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref> These roads are:\n\n* [[New Zealand State Highway 1|SH 1]] [[Waikato Expressway]], from around 1.3&nbsp;km south of the Tamahere interchange ([[New Zealand State Highway 21|SH 21]]) to the end of the expressway at the Cambridge South interchange.\n* [[New Zealand State Highway 1|SH 2]] [[Tauranga Eastern Link]], from the Domain Road interchange to the end of the motorway at the [[Paengaroa]] roundabout ([[New Zealand State Highway 33|SH 33]])\n\n===Types of speed limit===\nThere are several different types of speed limit:\n*Default - The default speed limit is only posted as the speed limit when entering or leaving the designated urban and rural areas. In urban areas the default speed limit is 50 km/h, while in rural areas the speed limit is 100 km/h. The definition of an urban area is based on the presence of street lighting.\n*Permanent - where the posted speed limit is set for the specific section of road. There are repeater signs every 2 to 3 kilometers on these roads. These limits are often posted in areas where the urban or rural nature of the area is not obvious to road users and applying the default speed limit is unsafe.\n*Holiday - where the posted speed limit only applies for specific (holiday) periods. Outside the specific period the speed limit sign is removed or not visible. An example is on [[New Zealand State Highway 6|State Highway 6]] through [[Pelorus Bridge]], which has a holiday speed limit of 50&nbsp;km/h annually between 20 December and 31 January, but outside these dates the default limit of 100&nbsp;km/h applies.<ref name=\"NZTA bylaw\">{{cite web |url= https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/Bylaws-state-highway/Bylaw-2010-10-New-Zealand-Transport-Agency-Speed-Limits-on-State-Highways-Bylaw-September-2010.pdf |title= Bylaw 2010/10: New Zealand Transport Agency (Speed Limits on State Highways) Bylaw |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n*Variable - where the speed limit can change at different times of the day due to the changing nature of road hazards.

The purpose of a demo is to show off [[computer programming|programming]], visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as [[Demoscene#Parties|demoparties]], voted on by those who attend, and released online.\n\nThe demoscene's roots are in the [[home computer]] revolution of the late 1970s, and the subsequent advent of [[software cracking]]. Crackers altered the code of [[video game]]s to remove copy protection, claiming credit by adding introduction screens of their own (\"[[crack intro|cracktros]]\"). They soon started competing for the best visual presentation of these additions.<ref name=\"WiderScreen 2014-04-15\">{{cite web|url=http://widerscreen.fi/numerot/2014-1-2/crackers-became-us-demosceners/|title=How Those Crackers Became Us Demosceners|last1=Reunanen|first1=Markku|date=15 April 2014|publisher=WiderScreen|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> Through the making of intros and stand-alone demos, a new community eventually evolved, independent of the gaming<ref name=\"reunanen2010\" />{{rp|29\u201330}} and [[Warez scene|software sharing]] scenes.\n\n== Concept ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=May 2018}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DemoSample.jpg|270px|thumb|A screenshot of the 64-kilobyte demo ''Heaven Seven'' by ''Exceed''.|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 23 April 2009|date=March 2012}}]] -->\n[[File:FC-SR-logo.jpg|270px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Second Reality]], a demo by [[Future Crew]].<ref name=\"top10hacks\">{{cite web\n| url=http://slashdot.org/features/99/12/13/0943241.shtml\n| title=Slashdot's \"Top 10 Hacks of All Time\"\n|accessdate=25 December 2010\n|date=13 December 1999\n|publisher=slashdot.org\n|quote=''Second Reality by Future Crew \u2013 Awesome, Mindblowing, Unbelievable, Impossible.

Therefore, the variations among [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]] created for one computer line were attributed to programming alone, rather than one computer having better hardware. This created a competitive environment in which [[demo group|demoscene groups]] would try to outperform each other in creating outstanding [[demo effect|effects]], and often to demonstrate why they felt one machine was better than another (for example [[Commodore 64]] or [[Amiga]] versus [[Atari 8-bit family]] or [[Atari ST]]).\n\nDemo writers went to great lengths to get every last bit of performance out of their target machine. Where games and application writers were concerned with the stability and functionality of their software, the demo writer was typically interested in how many [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles a routine would consume and, more generally, how best to squeeze great activity onto the screen. Writers went so far as to [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] known hardware errors to produce effects that the manufacturer of the computer had not intended. The perception that the demo scene was going to extremes and charting new territory added to its draw.\n\n===Categories===\nThere are several categories demos are informally classified into, the most important being the division between freeform '''demos''' and size-restricted '''intros''', a difference visible in the competitions of nearly any demo party. The most typical competition categories for intros are the '''[[64k intro|64K intro]]''' and the '''4K intro''', where the size of the executable file is restricted to 65536 and 4096 bytes, respectively.  In other competitions the choice of platform is restricted; only 8-bit computers like the Atari 800 or Commodore 64, or the 16-bit [[Amiga]] or [[Atari ST]]. Such restrictions provide a challenge for coders, musicians and graphics artists, to make a device do more than was intended in its original design.\n\n== History ==\n<!--[[File:Game Music 4.png|thumb|270px|Game Music IV on the [[Commodore 64]] by [[Charles Deenen]] (also known as \"The Mercenary Cracker\" (TMC)) was perhaps one of the very first demos ever produced.

Display hacks predate the demoscene by several decades, with the [[First video game|earliest examples]] dating back to the early 1950s.<ref name=\"display hacks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/D/display-hack.html|title=display hacks|last1=Raymond|first1=Eric S.|publisher=The Jargon File|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nDemos in the demoscene sense began as [[Software cracking|software crackers]]' \"signatures\", that is, crack screens and [[crack intro]]s attached to software whose [[copy protection]] was removed. The first crack screens appeared on the [[Apple II]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} and they were often nothing but plain text screens crediting the cracker or their group. Gradually, these static screens evolved into increasingly impressive-looking introductions containing animated effects and music. Eventually, many cracker groups started to release intro-like programs separately, without being attached to unlicensed software. These programs were initially known by various names, such as ''letters'' or ''messages'', but they later came to be known as ''demos''.<ref name=\"demo or die\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/1995/07/democoders/|title=Demo or Die!|last1=Green|first1=Dave|date=1 July 1995|magazine=Wired|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, [[Atari, Inc.]] began using a looping demo with visual effects and music to show off the features of the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800 computers]] in stores.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atari In-Store Demonstration Program by Atari, 1980|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj5qtlQ74J0|website=YouTube}}</ref> At the 1985 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Atari showed a demoscene-style demo for its latest 8-bit computers that alternated between a 3D walking robot and a flying spaceship, each with its own music, and animating larger objects than typically seen on those systems; the two sections were separated by the Atari logo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atari 1985 CES Demo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4YtHW7Gh0|website=YouTube}}</ref> The program was released to the public. Also in 1985, a large, spinning, checkered ball&mdash;casting a translucent shadow&mdash;was the signature demo of what the hardware was capable of when Commodore's [[Amiga]] was announced.\n\nSimple demo-like music collections were put together on the C64 in 1985 by [[Charles Deenen]], inspired by crack intros, using music taken from games and adding some homemade color graphics.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In the following year the movement now known as the demoscene was born. The Dutch groups 1001 Crew and [[The Judges (c64 group)|The Judges]], both Commodore 64-based, are often mentioned{{by whom|date=May 2018}} as the earliest demo groups.  Whilst competing with each other in 1986, they both produced pure demos with original graphics and music involving more than just casual work, and used extensive hardware trickery. At the same time demos from others, such as [[Antony Crowther]], had started circulating on [[Compunet]] in the United Kingdom. On the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Castor Cracking Group]] released their first demo called ''Castor Intro'' in 1986.  The [[ZX Spectrum demos|ZX Spectrum demo scene]] was slow to start, but it started to rise in the late 1980s, most noticeably in Eastern Europe.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe demoscene is mainly a European phenomenon, and is predominantly male.<ref name=\"reunanen2009\">{{cite conference |last1=Reunanen |first1=Markku |first2=Antti |last2=Silvast |title=Demoscene Platforms: A Case Study on the Adoption of Home Computers |conference=History of Nordic Computing |year=2009 |pages=289\u2013301 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03757-3_30}}</ref> It is a competition-oriented subculture, with groups and individual artists competing against each other in technical and artistic excellence.

It has also been common for [[Disk magazine|diskmags]] to have voting-based ''charts'' which provide ranking lists for the best coders, graphicians, musicians, demos and other things. However, the respect for charts has diminished since the 1990s.\n\nParty-based competitions usually require the artist or a group member to be present at the event. The winners are selected by a public voting amongst the visitors and awarded at a prizegiving ceremony at the end of the party. Competitions at a typical demo event include a ''demo compo'', an ''intro compo'' (usually 4&nbsp;kB and 64&nbsp;kB), a ''graphics compo'' and a ''music compo''. Most parties also split some categories by platform, format or style.\n\nThere are no criteria or rules the voters should be bound by, and a visitor typically just votes for those entries that made the biggest impression on them. In the old demos, the impression was often attempted with programming techniques introducing new effects and breaking performance records in old effects; the emphasis has moved from technical excellence to more artistic values such as overall design, audiovisual impact and mood.\n\nIn recent years, an initiative to award demos in an alternative way arose by the name of the [[Scene.org Awards]]. The essential concept of the awards was to avoid the subjectivity of mass-voting at parties, and select a well-renowned jury to handle the task of selecting the given year's best productions on several aspects, such as Best Graphics or Best 64k Intro. This award was canceled in 2012.\n\n=== Groups ===\n[[File:Demo PC BlackMaiden Interceptor.jpg|thumb|270px|PC-Demo: Interceptor by Black Maiden.]]\n{{Main|Demogroup}}\nDemosceners typically organize in small, tightly-knit groups, centered around a ''coder'' ([[computer programmer|programmer]]), a ''musician'' and a ''graphician'' (graphics designer). Various other supporting roles exist and groups can grow to dozens of people, but most demos are actually created by a small number of people.<ref name=\"reunanen2010\" />{{rp|32\u201333}}\n\nGroups always have names, and similarly the individual members pick a handle by which they will be addressed in the large community. While the practice of using handles rather than real names is a borrowing from the cracker/warez culture, where it serves to hide the identity of the cracker from law enforcement, in the demoscene (oriented toward legal activities) it mostly serves as a manner of self-expression. Group members tend to self-identify with the group, often extending their handle with their group's name, following the patterns \"''Handle'' of ''Group''\" or \"''Handle''/''Group''\".<ref name=\"reunanen2010\" />{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n== Parties ==\n[[File:Assembly2004-areena01.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Assembly (demoparty)|Assembly]] 2004 \u2013 a combination of a demoparty and a [[LAN party]]]]\nA '''demoparty''' is an event that gathers demosceners<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scheib.net/play/demos/what/borzyskowski/index.html|title=The Hacker Demo Scene And {{sic|It|'s|nolink=y}} Cultural Artifacts by George Borzyskowski - Vince Scheib|first=Vince|last=Scheib|publisher=scheib.net}}</ref> and other computer enthusiasts to partake in competitions called ''Demoscene compos''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/D/demoparty.html|title=Demoparty|publisher=catb.org}}</ref> of ''[[Demo (computer programming)|demos]]'' (short [[audio-visual]] presentations of [[computer art]]).  A typical demoparty is a non-stop event spanning a weekend, providing the visitors a lot of time to socialize. The competing works, at least those in the most important competitions, are usually shown at night, using a [[video projector]] and [[loudspeaker]]s.<ref name=\"demographics\">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Demographics_BehindtheScene |first=Jeremy|last=Williams |year=2002|title=Demographics: Behind the Scene|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The most important competition is usually the '''demo compo'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scheib.net/play/demos/what/index.html|title=Demos Explained; What are Demos? What is a Demo? - Vince Scheib|first=Vince|last=Scheib|publisher=scheib.net}}</ref>\n\n=== Concept ===\nThe visitors of a demoparty often bring their own computers to compete and show off their works. To this end, most parties provide a large hall with tables, electricity and usually a [[local area network]] connected to the Internet. In this respect, many demoparties resemble [[LAN party|LAN parties]], and many of the largest events also gather gamers and other computer enthusiasts in addition to demosceners. A major difference between a real demoparty and a LAN party is that demosceners typically spend more time socializing (often outside the actual party hall) than in front of their computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breakpoint.untergrund.net/newvisitors.php|title=Breakpoint 2010 - Like There's No Tomorrow // Bingen am Rhein, Germany, Easter Weekend 2010|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLarge parties have often tried to come up with alternative terms to describe the concept to the general public. While the events have always been known as \"demoparties\", \"copyparties\" or just \"parties\" by the subculture itself, they are often referred to as \"computer conferences\", \"computer fairs\", \"computer festivals\", \"computer art festivals\", \"youngsters' computer events\" or even \"geek gatherings\" or \"nerd festivals\" by the mass media and the general public.\n\nDemoscene events are most frequent in continental [[Europe]], with around fifty parties every year\u2014in comparison, the [[United States]] only has two or three each year. Most events are local, gathering demomakers mostly from a single country, while the largest international parties (such as [[Breakpoint demo party|Breakpoint]] and [[Assembly demo party|Assembly]]) attract visitors from all over the globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demoscene.info/|title=The Demoscene - the portal on the demoscene|publisher=demoscene.info}}</ref>\n\nMost demoparties are relatively small in size, with the number of visitors varying from dozens to a few hundred. The largest events typically gather thousands of visitors, although most of them have little or no connection to the demoscene. In that aspect, the scene separates \"pure\" parties (which abandons non-scene related activities and promotion) from \"crossover\" parties.\n\n=== History ===\nDemoparties started to appear in the 1980s in the form of copyparties, where software pirates and demomakers gathered to meet each other and share their software. Competitions did not become a major aspect of the events until the early 1990s.\n\nCopyparties mainly pertained to the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] and [[Commodore 64|C64]] scene. As the [[IBM PC|PC compatibles]] started to take over the market, the difficulties in easily making nice demos and intros increased. Along with increased [[police]] crackdowns on copying of copyrighted software, the \"underground\" copyparties were gradually replaced by slightly higher-profile events that came to be known as demoparties. However, some of the \"old-school\" demosceners still prefer to use the word ''copyparty'' even for today's demoparties.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the focus of the events shifted away from illegal activities into demomaking and competitions. The copying of copyrighted material was often explicitly prohibited by the organizers, and many events also forbade the consumption of alcohol. However, illegal copying and \"boozing\" still continued to take place, although in a less public form.\n\nThree well-known and appreciated large-scale demoparties were established in the early 1990s: [[The Party (demo party)|The Party]] in [[Denmark]], [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly]] in [[Finland]] and [[The Gathering (demo party)|The Gathering]] in [[Norway]]. Taking place every year and gathering thousands of visitors, these parties used to be the leading demoscene events in this period. Assembly still retains this status today. The Gathering continues to be organized yearly as a generic \"computer party\", but most of the demosceners now prefer [[Revision (demoparty)|Revision]] in [[Germany]], which takes place at the same time.\n\nThe emergence of high-profile demoparties gave rise to phenomena that were not always well welcomed by the scene. The events started to attract unaffiliated computer enthusiasts who were often generally referred to as \"lamers\" by the original attendants. A particularly visible group in the large gatherings since the mid-1990s have been the LAN gamers, who often have very little interest in the demoscene and mainly use the party facilities for playing multi-player computer games. However, many of today's demosceners received their first interest for demos and demomaking from a visit to a large demoparty.\n\n===Common properties===\n[[File:Evoke 2002 3D Brillen.jpg|thumb|[[Evoke (demo party)|Evoke]] 2002: Spectators at one of the demoshow rooms watch computer animations in 3D.]]\n\nParties usually last from two to four days, most often from Friday to Sunday to ensure that sceners who work or study are also able to attend. Small parties (under 100 attendants) usually take place in [[cultural center]]s or schools, whereas larger parties (over 400\u2013500 people) typically take place in [[sports hall]]s or [[concert hall]]s.\n\nEntrance fees are usually between \u20ac10 and \u20ac40, given the size and location of the party. During the 90s it was common practice in many countries to allow females to enter the party for free (mostly due to the low concentration of female attendees, which is usually under 20%), albeit most parties still enforced an \"only vote with ticket\" rule, which means that an attendee who got in free was only able to vote with a paid ticket. This practice was largely abandoned in the 2010s.\n\nAttendees are allowed to bring their desktop computer along, but this is by no means a necessity and is usually omitted by most sceners, especially those who travel long distance. Those who have computer-related jobs may even regard a demoparty as a well-deserved break from sitting in front of a computer. For those who do bring a computer, it is becoming increasingly common to bring a laptop or some sort of handheld device rather than a complete desktop PC.\n\nPartygoers often bring various senseless gadgets to parties to make their desk space look unique; this can be anything from a disco ball or a [[plasma globe|plasma lamp]] to a large [[LED#LED display panels|LED display panel]] complete with a scrolling message about how \"elite\" its owner is. Many visitors also bring large loudspeakers for playing music. This kind of activity is particularly common among new partygoers, while the more experienced attendees tend to prefer a more quiet and relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThose who need housing during the party are often offered a separate \"sleeping room\", usually an isolated empty room with some sort of carpet or mats, where the attendees are able to sleep, separated from the noise. Most sceners prefer bringing [[sleeping bag]]s for this, as well as [[air mattress]]es or [[sleeping pad]]s. Parties that do not offer a sleeping room generally allow sceners to sleep under the tables.\n\nPartyplaces often become decorated by visitors with flyers and banners. These all serve promotional reasons, in most cases to advertise a certain group, but sometimes to create promotion for a given demoscene product, such as a demo or a diskmag, possibly to be released later at the party.\n\nA major portion of the events at a demoparty often takes place outdoors. Demosceners usually spend considerable time outside to have a beer and talk, or engage into some sort of open-air activity such as [[barbecue|barbecuing]] or sport, such as hardware throwing or soccer. It is also a common tradition to gather around a [[bonfire]] during the night, usually after the compos.\n\nIn recent years, many parties were available for spectators through the Internet: This tradition was first started by the live team of [[demoscene.tv]], who broadcast from the event live or created footage for a postmortem video-report. This has since been ostensibly replaced by the [[SceneSat]] radio crew, who provide live streaming radio shows from parties, and larger parties now offer their own dedicated streaming video solution.\n\n===List of demoparties===\nThis is an incomplete list, but shows major parties over the years.\n''(Note: Year ranges might include years when the party wasn't organized, but was organized both before and after.)''\n\n<!-- please help keep the list items in alphabetical order-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=\"150\"|Party name\n!Location\n!width=\"80\"|Years\n!Description\n|-\n|'''7DX Party'''\n|[[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\n|2002\u20132013\n|7DX is an annual demoparty that has been held since 2002 in Turkey.

A form of static computer graphics where demosceners have traditionally excelled is [[pixel art]]; see ''[[artscene]]'' for more information on the related subculture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver the years, desktop computer hardware capabilities have improved by orders of magnitude, and so for most programmers, tight hardware restrictions are no longer a common issue. Nevertheless, demosceners continue to study and experiment with creating impressive effects on limited hardware. Since [[handheld console]]s and cellular phones have comparable processing power or capabilities to the desktop platforms of old (such as low resolution screens which require pixel-art, or very limited storage and memory for music replay), many demosceners have been able to apply their niche skills to develop games for these platforms, and earn a living doing so.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} One particular example is [[Angry Birds]], whose lead designer Jaakko Iisalo was an active and well-known demoscener in the 90s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/meet-man-behind-angry-birds/|title=Edge Magazine \u2013 GamesRadar+|website=edge-online.com}}</ref>\n\nSome attempts have been made to increase the familiarity of demos as an art form.

The purpose of a demo is to show off [[computer programming|programming]], visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as [[Demoscene#Parties|demoparties]], voted on by those who attend, and released online.\n\nThe demoscene's roots are in the [[home computer]] revolution of the late 1970s, and the subsequent advent of [[software cracking]]. Crackers altered the code of [[video game]]s to remove copy protection, claiming credit by adding introduction screens of their own (\"[[crack intro|cracktros]]\"). They soon started competing for the best visual presentation of these additions.<ref name=\"WiderScreen 2014-04-15\">{{cite web|url=http://widerscreen.fi/numerot/2014-1-2/crackers-became-us-demosceners/|title=How Those Crackers Became Us Demosceners|last1=Reunanen|first1=Markku|date=15 April 2014|publisher=WiderScreen|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> Through the making of intros and stand-alone demos, a new community eventually evolved, independent of the gaming<ref name=\"reunanen2010\" />{{rp|29\u201330}} and [[Warez scene|software sharing]] scenes.\n\n== Concept ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=May 2018}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DemoSample.jpg|270px|thumb|A screenshot of the 64-kilobyte demo ''Heaven Seven'' by ''Exceed''.|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 23 April 2009|date=March 2012}}]] -->\n[[File:FC-SR-logo.jpg|270px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Second Reality]], a demo by [[Future Crew]].<ref name=\"top10hacks\">{{cite web\n| url=http://slashdot.org/features/99/12/13/0943241.shtml\n| title=Slashdot's \"Top 10 Hacks of All Time\"\n|accessdate=25 December 2010\n|date=13 December 1999\n|publisher=slashdot.org\n|quote=''Second Reality by Future Crew \u2013 Awesome, Mindblowing, Unbelievable, Impossible.

Therefore, the variations among [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]] created for one computer line were attributed to programming alone, rather than one computer having better hardware. This created a competitive environment in which [[demo group|demoscene groups]] would try to outperform each other in creating outstanding [[demo effect|effects]], and often to demonstrate why they felt one machine was better than another (for example [[Commodore 64]] or [[Amiga]] versus [[Atari 8-bit family]] or [[Atari ST]]).\n\nDemo writers went to great lengths to get every last bit of performance out of their target machine. Where games and application writers were concerned with the stability and functionality of their software, the demo writer was typically interested in how many [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles a routine would consume and, more generally, how best to squeeze great activity onto the screen. Writers went so far as to [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] known hardware errors to produce effects that the manufacturer of the computer had not intended. The perception that the demo scene was going to extremes and charting new territory added to its draw.\n\n===Categories===\nThere are several categories demos are informally classified into, the most important being the division between freeform '''demos''' and size-restricted '''intros''', a difference visible in the competitions of nearly any demo party. The most typical competition categories for intros are the '''[[64k intro|64K intro]]''' and the '''4K intro''', where the size of the executable file is restricted to 65536 and 4096 bytes, respectively.  In other competitions the choice of platform is restricted; only 8-bit computers like the Atari 800 or Commodore 64, or the 16-bit [[Amiga]] or [[Atari ST]]. Such restrictions provide a challenge for coders, musicians and graphics artists, to make a device do more than was intended in its original design.\n\n== History ==\n<!--[[File:Game Music 4.png|thumb|270px|Game Music IV on the [[Commodore 64]] by [[Charles Deenen]] (also known as \"The Mercenary Cracker\" (TMC)) was perhaps one of the very first demos ever produced. Though TMC dated all his productions to 1991, this demo is known to have been produced in 1985.]]-->\nThe earliest computer programs that have some resemblance to demos and [[demo effect]]s can be found among the so-called [[display hack]]s. Display hacks predate the demoscene by several decades, with the [[First video game|earliest examples]] dating back to the early 1950s.<ref name=\"display hacks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/D/display-hack.html|title=display hacks|last1=Raymond|first1=Eric S.|publisher=The Jargon File|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nDemos in the demoscene sense began as [[Software cracking|software crackers]]' \"signatures\", that is, crack screens and [[crack intro]]s attached to software whose [[copy protection]] was removed. The first crack screens appeared on the [[Apple II]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} and they were often nothing but plain text screens crediting the cracker or their group. Gradually, these static screens evolved into increasingly impressive-looking introductions containing animated effects and music. Eventually, many cracker groups started to release intro-like programs separately, without being attached to unlicensed software. These programs were initially known by various names, such as ''letters'' or ''messages'', but they later came to be known as ''demos''.<ref name=\"demo or die\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/1995/07/democoders/|title=Demo or Die!|last1=Green|first1=Dave|date=1 July 1995|magazine=Wired|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, [[Atari, Inc.]] began using a looping demo with visual effects and music to show off the features of the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800 computers]] in stores.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atari In-Store Demonstration Program by Atari, 1980|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj5qtlQ74J0|website=YouTube}}</ref> At the 1985 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Atari showed a demoscene-style demo for its latest 8-bit computers that alternated between a 3D walking robot and a flying spaceship, each with its own music, and animating larger objects than typically seen on those systems; the two sections were separated by the Atari logo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atari 1985 CES Demo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4YtHW7Gh0|website=YouTube}}</ref> The program was released to the public. Also in 1985, a large, spinning, checkered ball&mdash;casting a translucent shadow&mdash;was the signature demo of what the hardware was capable of when Commodore's [[Amiga]] was announced.\n\nSimple demo-like music collections were put together on the C64 in 1985 by [[Charles Deenen]], inspired by crack intros, using music taken from games and adding some homemade color graphics.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In the following year the movement now known as the demoscene was born. The Dutch groups 1001 Crew and [[The Judges (c64 group)|The Judges]], both Commodore 64-based, are often mentioned{{by whom|date=May 2018}} as the earliest demo groups.  Whilst competing with each other in 1986, they both produced pure demos with original graphics and music involving more than just casual work, and used extensive hardware trickery. At the same time demos from others, such as [[Antony Crowther]], had started circulating on [[Compunet]] in the United Kingdom. On the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Castor Cracking Group]] released their first demo called ''Castor Intro'' in 1986.  The [[ZX Spectrum demos|ZX Spectrum demo scene]] was slow to start, but it started to rise in the late 1980s, most noticeably in Eastern Europe.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe demoscene is mainly a European phenomenon, and is predominantly male.<ref name=\"reunanen2009\">{{cite conference |last1=Reunanen |first1=Markku |first2=Antti |last2=Silvast |title=Demoscene Platforms: A Case Study on the Adoption of Home Computers |conference=History of Nordic Computing |year=2009 |pages=289\u2013301 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03757-3_30}}</ref> It is a competition-oriented subculture, with groups and individual artists competing against each other in technical and artistic excellence. Those who achieve excellence are dubbed \"elite\", while those who do not follow the demoscene's implicit rules are called \"lamers\"; such rules emphasize creativity over \"ripping\" (or else licensing) the works of others, having good contacts within the scene, and showing effort rather than asking for help.<ref name=\"reunanen2009\" /> Both this competitiveness and the sense of cooperation among demosceners have led to comparisons with the earlier [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]] in academic computing.<ref name=\"reunanen2009\" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Gregory |last=Turner-Rahman |title=the demoscene |encyclopedia=Media Authorship |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |editor-first1=Cynthia |editor-last1=Chris |editor-first2=David A. |editor-last2=Gerstner}}</ref>{{rp|159}} The demoscene is a closed subculture, which seeks and receives little mainstream public interest.<ref name=\"reunanen2010\">{{cite thesis |author=Markku Reunanen |year=2010 |title=Computer Demos\u2014What Makes Them Tick? |type=[[Licentiate (degree)|Lic.]] |publisher=[[Aalto University]]}}</ref>{{rp|4}} {{As of|2010}}, the size of the scene was estimated at some 10,000.<ref name=\"hartmann\">{{cite conference |last=Hartmann |first=Doreen |title=Computer Demos and the Demoscene: Artistic Subcultural Innovation in Real-Time. |conference=16th International Symposium of Electronic Art |year=2010 |url=http://www.isea2010ruhr.org/files/redaktion/pdf/isea2010_proceedings_p11_hartmann.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn the early days, competition came in the form of setting records, like the number of \"bobs\" ([[blitter object]]s) on the screen per frame, or the number of [[Commodore 64 demos|DYCP]] (Different Y Character Position) scrollers on a C64.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} These days, there are organized competitions, or [[compo (slang word)|compos]], held at [[Demoparty|demoparties]], although there have been some online competitions as well. It has also been common for [[Disk magazine|diskmags]] to have voting-based ''charts'' which provide ranking lists for the best coders, graphicians, musicians, demos and other things. However, the respect for charts has diminished since the 1990s.\n\nParty-based competitions usually require the artist or a group member to be present at the event. The winners are selected by a public voting amongst the visitors and awarded at a prizegiving ceremony at the end of the party. Competitions at a typical demo event include a ''demo compo'', an ''intro compo'' (usually 4&nbsp;kB and 64&nbsp;kB), a ''graphics compo'' and a ''music compo''. Most parties also split some categories by platform, format or style.\n\nThere are no criteria or rules the voters should be bound by, and a visitor typically just votes for those entries that made the biggest impression on them. In the old demos, the impression was often attempted with programming techniques introducing new effects and breaking performance records in old effects; the emphasis has moved from technical excellence to more artistic values such as overall design, audiovisual impact and mood.\n\nIn recent years, an initiative to award demos in an alternative way arose by the name of the [[Scene.org Awards]]. The essential concept of the awards was to avoid the subjectivity of mass-voting at parties, and select a well-renowned jury to handle the task of selecting the given year's best productions on several aspects, such as Best Graphics or Best 64k Intro. This award was canceled in 2012.\n\n=== Groups ===\n[[File:Demo PC BlackMaiden Interceptor.jpg|thumb|270px|PC-Demo: Interceptor by Black Maiden.]]\n{{Main|Demogroup}}\nDemosceners typically organize in small, tightly-knit groups, centered around a ''coder'' ([[computer programmer|programmer]]), a ''musician'' and a ''graphician'' (graphics designer). Various other supporting roles exist and groups can grow to dozens of people, but most demos are actually created by a small number of people.<ref name=\"reunanen2010\" />{{rp|32\u201333}}\n\nGroups always have names, and similarly the individual members pick a handle by which they will be addressed in the large community. While the practice of using handles rather than real names is a borrowing from the cracker/warez culture, where it serves to hide the identity of the cracker from law enforcement, in the demoscene (oriented toward legal activities) it mostly serves as a manner of self-expression. Group members tend to self-identify with the group, often extending their handle with their group's name, following the patterns \"''Handle'' of ''Group''\" or \"''Handle''/''Group''\".<ref name=\"reunanen2010\" />{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n== Parties ==\n[[File:Assembly2004-areena01.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Assembly (demoparty)|Assembly]] 2004 \u2013 a combination of a demoparty and a [[LAN party]]]]\nA '''demoparty''' is an event that gathers demosceners<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scheib.net/play/demos/what/borzyskowski/index.html|title=The Hacker Demo Scene And {{sic|It|'s|nolink=y}} Cultural Artifacts by George Borzyskowski - Vince Scheib|first=Vince|last=Scheib|publisher=scheib.net}}</ref> and other computer enthusiasts to partake in competitions called ''Demoscene compos''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/D/demoparty.html|title=Demoparty|publisher=catb.org}}</ref> of ''[[Demo (computer programming)|demos]]'' (short [[audio-visual]] presentations of [[computer art]]).  A typical demoparty is a non-stop event spanning a weekend, providing the visitors a lot of time to socialize. The competing works, at least those in the most important competitions, are usually shown at night, using a [[video projector]] and [[loudspeaker]]s.<ref name=\"demographics\">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Demographics_BehindtheScene |first=Jeremy|last=Williams |year=2002|title=Demographics: Behind the Scene|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The most important competition is usually the '''demo compo'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scheib.net/play/demos/what/index.html|title=Demos Explained; What are Demos? What is a Demo? - Vince Scheib|first=Vince|last=Scheib|publisher=scheib.net}}</ref>\n\n=== Concept ===\nThe visitors of a demoparty often bring their own computers to compete and show off their works. To this end, most parties provide a large hall with tables, electricity and usually a [[local area network]] connected to the Internet. In this respect, many demoparties resemble [[LAN party|LAN parties]], and many of the largest events also gather gamers and other computer enthusiasts in addition to demosceners. A major difference between a real demoparty and a LAN party is that demosceners typically spend more time socializing (often outside the actual party hall) than in front of their computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breakpoint.untergrund.net/newvisitors.php|title=Breakpoint 2010 - Like There's No Tomorrow // Bingen am Rhein, Germany, Easter Weekend 2010|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLarge parties have often tried to come up with alternative terms to describe the concept to the general public. While the events have always been known as \"demoparties\", \"copyparties\" or just \"parties\" by the subculture itself, they are often referred to as \"computer conferences\", \"computer fairs\", \"computer festivals\", \"computer art festivals\", \"youngsters' computer events\" or even \"geek gatherings\" or \"nerd festivals\" by the mass media and the general public.\n\nDemoscene events are most frequent in continental [[Europe]], with around fifty parties every year\u2014in comparison, the [[United States]] only has two or three each year. Most events are local, gathering demomakers mostly from a single country, while the largest international parties (such as [[Breakpoint demo party|Breakpoint]] and [[Assembly demo party|Assembly]]) attract visitors from all over the globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demoscene.info/|title=The Demoscene - the portal on the demoscene|publisher=demoscene.info}}</ref>\n\nMost demoparties are relatively small in size, with the number of visitors varying from dozens to a few hundred. The largest events typically gather thousands of visitors, although most of them have little or no connection to the demoscene. In that aspect, the scene separates \"pure\" parties (which abandons non-scene related activities and promotion) from \"crossover\" parties.\n\n=== History ===\nDemoparties started to appear in the 1980s in the form of copyparties, where software pirates and demomakers gathered to meet each other and share their software. Competitions did not become a major aspect of the events until the early 1990s.\n\nCopyparties mainly pertained to the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] and [[Commodore 64|C64]] scene. As the [[IBM PC|PC compatibles]] started to take over the market, the difficulties in easily making nice demos and intros increased. Along with increased [[police]] crackdowns on copying of copyrighted software, the \"underground\" copyparties were gradually replaced by slightly higher-profile events that came to be known as demoparties. However, some of the \"old-school\" demosceners still prefer to use the word ''copyparty'' even for today's demoparties.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the focus of the events shifted away from illegal activities into demomaking and competitions. The copying of copyrighted material was often explicitly prohibited by the organizers, and many events also forbade the consumption of alcohol. However, illegal copying and \"boozing\" still continued to take place, although in a less public form.\n\nThree well-known and appreciated large-scale demoparties were established in the early 1990s: [[The Party (demo party)|The Party]] in [[Denmark]], [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly]] in [[Finland]] and [[The Gathering (demo party)|The Gathering]] in [[Norway]]. Taking place every year and gathering thousands of visitors, these parties used to be the leading demoscene events in this period. Assembly still retains this status today. The Gathering continues to be organized yearly as a generic \"computer party\", but most of the demosceners now prefer [[Revision (demoparty)|Revision]] in [[Germany]], which takes place at the same time.\n\nThe emergence of high-profile demoparties gave rise to phenomena that were not always well welcomed by the scene. The events started to attract unaffiliated computer enthusiasts who were often generally referred to as \"lamers\" by the original attendants. A particularly visible group in the large gatherings since the mid-1990s have been the LAN gamers, who often have very little interest in the demoscene and mainly use the party facilities for playing multi-player computer games. However, many of today's demosceners received their first interest for demos and demomaking from a visit to a large demoparty.\n\n===Common properties===\n[[File:Evoke 2002 3D Brillen.jpg|thumb|[[Evoke (demo party)|Evoke]] 2002: Spectators at one of the demoshow rooms watch computer animations in 3D.]]\n\nParties usually last from two to four days, most often from Friday to Sunday to ensure that sceners who work or study are also able to attend. Small parties (under 100 attendants) usually take place in [[cultural center]]s or schools, whereas larger parties (over 400\u2013500 people) typically take place in [[sports hall]]s or [[concert hall]]s.\n\nEntrance fees are usually between \u20ac10 and \u20ac40, given the size and location of the party. During the 90s it was common practice in many countries to allow females to enter the party for free (mostly due to the low concentration of female attendees, which is usually under 20%), albeit most parties still enforced an \"only vote with ticket\" rule, which means that an attendee who got in free was only able to vote with a paid ticket. This practice was largely abandoned in the 2010s.\n\nAttendees are allowed to bring their desktop computer along, but this is by no means a necessity and is usually omitted by most sceners, especially those who travel long distance. Those who have computer-related jobs may even regard a demoparty as a well-deserved break from sitting in front of a computer. For those who do bring a computer, it is becoming increasingly common to bring a laptop or some sort of handheld device rather than a complete desktop PC.\n\nPartygoers often bring various senseless gadgets to parties to make their desk space look unique; this can be anything from a disco ball or a [[plasma globe|plasma lamp]] to a large [[LED#LED display panels|LED display panel]] complete with a scrolling message about how \"elite\" its owner is. Many visitors also bring large loudspeakers for playing music. This kind of activity is particularly common among new partygoers, while the more experienced attendees tend to prefer a more quiet and relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThose who need housing during the party are often offered a separate \"sleeping room\", usually an isolated empty room with some sort of carpet or mats, where the attendees are able to sleep, separated from the noise. Most sceners prefer bringing [[sleeping bag]]s for this, as well as [[air mattress]]es or [[sleeping pad]]s. Parties that do not offer a sleeping room generally allow sceners to sleep under the tables.\n\nPartyplaces often become decorated by visitors with flyers and banners. These all serve promotional reasons, in most cases to advertise a certain group, but sometimes to create promotion for a given demoscene product, such as a demo or a diskmag, possibly to be released later at the party.\n\nA major portion of the events at a demoparty often takes place outdoors. Demosceners usually spend considerable time outside to have a beer and talk, or engage into some sort of open-air activity such as [[barbecue|barbecuing]] or sport, such as hardware throwing or soccer. It is also a common tradition to gather around a [[bonfire]] during the night, usually after the compos.\n\nIn recent years, many parties were available for spectators through the Internet: This tradition was first started by the live team of [[demoscene.tv]], who broadcast from the event live or created footage for a postmortem video-report. This has since been ostensibly replaced by the [[SceneSat]] radio crew, who provide live streaming radio shows from parties, and larger parties now offer their own dedicated streaming video solution.\n\n===List of demoparties===\nThis is an incomplete list, but shows major parties over the years.\n''(Note: Year ranges might include years when the party wasn't organized, but was organized both before and after.)''\n\n<!-- please help keep the list items in alphabetical order-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=\"150\"|Party name\n!Location\n!width=\"80\"|Years\n!Description\n|-\n|'''7DX Party'''\n|[[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\n|2002\u20132013\n|7DX is an annual demoparty that has been held since 2002 in Turkey.

[[Tracker (music software)|Tracker music]], for example, originated in the Amiga games industry but was soon heavily dominated by demoscene musicians; producer [[Adam Fielding]]<ref>{{YouTube|sUbMjES6Xj0|Artist Feature: Adam Fielding}}</ref> claims to have tracker/demoscene roots. Currently, there is a major tracking scene separate from the actual demoscene. A form of static computer graphics where demosceners have traditionally excelled is [[pixel art]]; see ''[[artscene]]'' for more information on the related subculture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver the years, desktop computer hardware capabilities have improved by orders of magnitude, and so for most programmers, tight hardware restrictions are no longer a common issue. Nevertheless, demosceners continue to study and experiment with creating impressive effects on limited hardware. Since [[handheld console]]s and cellular phones have comparable processing power or capabilities to the desktop platforms of old (such as low resolution screens which require pixel-art, or very limited storage and memory for music replay), many demosceners have been able to apply their niche skills to develop games for these platforms, and earn a living doing so.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} One particular example is [[Angry Birds]], whose lead designer Jaakko Iisalo was an active and well-known demoscener in the 90s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/meet-man-behind-angry-birds/|title=Edge Magazine \u2013 GamesRadar+|website=edge-online.com}}</ref>\n\nSome attempts have been made to increase the familiarity of demos as an art form.
