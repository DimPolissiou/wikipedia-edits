He then sailed for [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. While in route for [[Singapore]] in 1847, his ship was attacked by pirates in the [[Riau Archipelago|Riau straight]]. On his way back it was almost shipwrecked.

[[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. Other villagers can also come to your island and chat with you! ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Three spin-off games have also been released: ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'' for [[Nintendo 3DS]], ''[[Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival]]'' for [[Wii U]], and ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' for mobile devices.\n\n== Common elements ==\n\n=== Characters ===\nWhile the series features various villagers for each title, certain prominent characters return in each series installment. [[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

Garbage is collected bi-weekly, organics are collected weekly or bi-weekly depending on the time of year, and recycling is collected weekly. All three waste streams are collected by a contracted company. Blue bins were used for recycling in the pilot program, but the city reverted to blue bags when launching the new waste system city-wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/spring-changes-coming-for-waste-collection-in-fort|title=Spring changes coming for the Fort's waste collection|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> This was because objects could get jammed in the blue bins, and crews could not easily tell if the loads inside blue bins were contaminated like they could with blue bags.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

He served as an aide to [[Nathanael Greene]] during the [[Siege of Boston]], participated in the placing of guns on the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]] in March 1776, and following the British abandonment of Boston, went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene's staff and was given command of an infantry company.\n\nSent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for [[Benedict Arnold]]'s army besieging Quebec, he arrived just in time to witness the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General [[John Burgoyne]] \u2013 which precipitated the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became aide to Arnold just prior to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. Shortly thereafter, he left Arnold's service and became an aide to General [[Horatio Gates]] in August 1776.\n\nWhen Gates sent him to Congress with official dispatches about the victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Wilkinson kept Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he finally showed up, he embellished his own role in the victory, and was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] as a [[brigadier general]] (despite being only 20 years old at the time) on November 6, 1777, and appointed to the newly created Board of War. The promotion over more senior colonels caused an uproar among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson's gossiping seemed to indicate he was a participant in the [[Conway Cabal]], a conspiracy to replace [[George Washington]] with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]]. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was compelled to resign in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress appointed him clothier-general of the Army, but he resigned on March 27, 1781, due to his \"lack of aptitude for the job\".<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n==Kentucky ventures==\nAfter his resignation from the Continental Army, Wilkinson reluctantly became a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Pennsylvania militia]] in 1782 and also a state assemblyman in 1783, due to the wishes of George Washington.<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|62}} He moved to [[Kentucky]] (at that time, just three counties still belonging to Virginia)  in 1784, and he was active there in efforts to achieve independence from [[Virginia]].\n\nIn April 1787, Wilkinson made a highly controversial trip to [[New Orleans]], which was the capital of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial Louisiana]].<ref name=\"Linklater\" />{{rp|80}} At that time, Americans were allowed to trade on the [[Mississippi River]], but they had to pay a hefty [[tariff]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Slaughter|first=Thomas|title=The Whiskey Rebellion|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=55}}</ref>  Wilkinson met with Spanish Governor [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]] and managed to convince him to allow Kentucky to have a trading monopoly on the River; in return he promised to promote Spanish interests in the west.<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 Trailing Lewis and Clark]\".

Kentucky had very nearly achieved statehood under the old [[Articles of Confederation]], and there was widespread disappointment when this was delayed because of the new constitution.\n\nLeading up to Kentucky's seventh convention regarding separation from Virginia in November 1788, Wilkinson attempted to gauge the support for Kentucky to seek union with Spain. Wilkinson's ability to win people over with his charm and sincerity got him elected committee chairman at the convention. He advocated for Kentucky to seek independence from Virginia first, and then to consider joining the [[United States|Union of states]] as a second step. For many, joining the Union was conditional upon the Union negotiating with Spain to arrange free navigation on the Mississippi River, a contentious point which many doubted the eastern states would act upon.\n\nUnable to gather enough support for his position at the convention, Wilkinson then approached Mir\u00f3 with a proposal. His intention was to obtain a [[Land grant|grant]] of 60,000 acres (243&nbsp;km\u00b2) in the [[Yazoo lands]], at the junction of the [[Yazoo River]] and the Mississippi (near present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]). The land was to serve as payment for Wilkinson's efforts on behalf of Spain, and to serve as a refuge in the event he and his supporters had to flee from the United States. Wilkinson asked for and received a pension of $7,000 from Mir\u00f3, while requesting pensions on behalf of several prominent Kentuckians, including: [[Harry Innes]], [[Benjamin Sebastian]], [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]], [[Caleb Wallace]], [[Benjamin Logan]], [[Isaac Shelby]], [[George Muter]], [[George Nicholas]], and even [[Humphrey Marshall (Senator)|Humphrey Marshall]] (who at one time was a bitter rival of Wilkinson's).\n\nHowever, by 1788 Wilkinson had apparently lost the confidence of officials in [[Spain]]. Mir\u00f3 was not to grant any of the proposed pensions and was forbidden from giving money to support a revolution in Kentucky. Furthermore, Wilkinson continued to secretly receive funds from Spain for many years.\n\n==Second military career==\n{{Wikisource|Lieut. Colonel-commandant Wilkinson's Report, August 24, 1791}}\nIn the [[Northwest Indian War]], Colonel Wilkinson led a force of Kentucky [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] against [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] at [[Ouiatenon]] in May 1791. He commanded a follow-up [[Raid (military)|raid]] that autumn, highlighted by the [[Battle of Kenapacomaqua]]. In October he received a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[U.S. Army]] as lieutenant colonel, commandant of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)#Origins|2nd U.S. Infantry]].\n\n===Rivalry with Wayne===\nWhen the United States government reorganized the Army as the [[Legion of the United States]], President George Washington was faced with the decision of whom to name as its commanding general. The two major candidates for this promotion were Wilkinson and [[Anthony Wayne]]. In the end, the cabinet chose Wayne due to Wilkinson's suspected involvement with the Spanish government. The cabinet promoted Wilkinson to brigadier general as consolation, since the President was aware of Wilkinson's fragile ego.\n\nWilkinson developed a jealousy of Wayne, but he maintained an ostensible respect toward the general. However, upon Wilkinson's refusal of an invitation to Wayne's Christmas party, Wayne developed a full-fledged hatred for Wilkinson, deeming the refusal to be an act of disrespect. For example, Wayne had led the Legion Army against the Native Americans in the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in August 1794. This battle was a huge victory for the United States, yet Wilkinson had criticized General Wayne's actions during the battle, simply to antagonize him.\n\nWilkinson proceeded to file formal complaints with President Washington, against Wayne and his decisions. Upon finding out about the complaints against him, Wayne decided to fight back, launching an investigation into Wilkinson's history with the Spanish. During all of this time, Wilkinson had renewed his secret alliance with the Spanish government (through the Governor of Louisiana [[Francisco Luis H\u00e9ctor de Carondelet]]), alerting them to the actions of both the US and the French occupancy in North America. When Spanish couriers were intercepted carrying payments for Wilkinson, Wayne's suspicions were confirmed and he attempted to [[court martial]] Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]], which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to them in return for large sums in gold, but most of his information was of little value.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\">Nelson, 1999</ref>\n\n===Quasi-War with France===\nWilkinson was transferred to the southern frontier in 1798. During the [[Quasi-War]] crisis of the late 1790s between [[French First Republic|France]] and the United States, he was given the third-place rank in the U.S. Army behind [[George Washington]] (who, having been succeeded as President by [[John Adams|Adams]], died in December 1799) and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Among other duties, Wilkinson was charged by Hamilton with establishing a \"Reserve Corps\" of American troops in the lower Ohio River Valley, who would seize the lower Mississippi River Valley and New Orleans in the event of war with France and her ally Spain.\n\nDespite the end of the crisis in mid-1800 and Hamilton being discharged from the Army, Wilkinson, for unknown reasons, continued the plan for the establishment of the base which he named \"Cantonment Wilkinson\" after himself. Located in the [[Indiana Territory]] (now southern [[Illinois]]), the base operated from January 1801 to late 1802 before finally being abandoned. Archaeologists from [[Southern Illinois University]] have located the remains of this base, which is producing much previously-unknown information and artifacts from the daily life of the frontier army.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cantonment Wilkinson (Helm) Site, Pulaski County, Illinois |url=https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |accessdate=2010-07-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723041340/https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |archivedate=2015-07-23 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm \"Ohio River Valley Forts: Cantonment Wilkinsonville\", ''Southernmost Illinois History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802234937/http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm |date=2010-08-02 }}</ref>\n\nWilkinson served his second, longer term as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]] from June 15, 1800, until January 27, 1812, when former Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]] was promoted to [[major general]] over Wilkinson.\n\n===Service under President Jefferson===\nWilkinson remained senior officer of the United States Army under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Along with Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Wilkinson shared the honor of taking possession of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] on behalf of the United States in 1803. At this time, Wilkinson renewed his treasonous relationship with Spanish colonial officials, offering advice to them on how to contain American expansion in exchange for the restoration of his pension. Among other things, Wilkinson tipped off the Spanish to the object of the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] and provided advice to the [[Sebasti\u00e1n Calvo de la Puerta, 1st Marquess of Casa Calvo|Marquess of Casa Calvo]] to aid in his negotiations over the Texas\u2013Louisiana border.<ref name=\"Cox1914\">{{cite journal|title=General Wilkinson and His Later Intrigues With the Spaniards|last=Cox|first=Isaac Joslin|date=July 1914|journal=American Historical Review|volume=XIX|issue=4|pages=794\u2013812|url=https://archive.org/details/generalwilkinson01coxi/}}</ref>\n\n===Connections with Aaron Burr===\nIn 1804\u201305, he met in person with [[Aaron Burr]] and they exchanged letters regarding [[Burr conspiracy|Burr's conspiracy]].  After Burr's arrest he claimed he was leading a group of settlers to take up residence on land in Texas which he had leased from the Spanish government in Mexico, while the government charged him with treason and claimed he intended to separate the then-western states and territories from the United States and establish an independent nation.\n\nWilkinson was both the senior brigadier general of the United States Army and the first [[List of Governors of Missouri|Governor of Louisiana Territory]], which made him someone whose support Burr would cultivate. In 1806 Burr is supposed to have sent a coded, unsigned letter (the \"Cipher Letter\", which Burr later denied having written) to Wilkinson, which stated that he was ready to commence his movement to Texas.  Burr's subsequent efforts to recruit participants in his plans became public, raising fears that he was conspiring with England to start a war with Spain.  Wilkinson became fearful that his role in Burr's plans and/or his spying for Spain would be exposed.  In October 1806 Wilkinson sent to President Jefferson a letter in which he painted Burr's actions in the worst possible light, while portraying himself as innocent of any involvement. Jefferson ordered Burr's arrest, and Burr was apprehended near [[Natchez, Mississippi]].\n\nWilkinson testified at Burr's trial, and the documents presented as evidence included the \"cipher letter\", which Wilkinson had given the prosecution.  However the letter was clearly altered to minimize Wilkinson's culpability.  This forgery, coupled with Wilkinson's obviously self-serving testimony, had the effect of making Burr seem to be the victim of an overzealous government.  The grand jury nearly produced enough votes in favor of indicting Wilkinson for [[misprision of treason]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Matthew L. |last2=Buckley |first2=Jay H. |date=2012 |title=Zebulon Pike, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Txq4Oh2NjTQC&pg=PA213 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=213 |isbn=978-0-8061-4243-2}}</ref> and foreman [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] said of Wilkinson that he was a \"mammoth of iniquity\", the \"most finished scoundrel\", and \"the only man I ever saw who was from the bark to the very core a villain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Isenberg |first=Nancy |date=2004 |title=Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBS8JwARKdkC&pg=PA148 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=148 |isbn=978-0-8078-2889-2}}</ref>\n\nDuring Burr's trial, Wilkinson placed New Orleans under martial law, against the will of [[William C. C. Claiborne|Governor Claiborne]],<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Wilkinson</ref> and imprisoned several people whom he thought may be able to connect him to Burr, along with attorneys who tried to defend them.<ref>https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/founding-traitor/</ref>\n\nHe was removed from the Territorial Governor's office after being publicly criticized for heavy-handed administration and abuse of power (and replaced with [[Meriwether Lewis]]). In addition, his actions around the Burr conspiracy became public, which aroused the public against him and led to two Congressional inquiries into his private ventures and intrigues.  President [[James Madison]], who had succeeded Jefferson in 1809, ordered a military court of inquiry in 1811, which resulted in a [[court-martial]] that exonerated Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\"/>\n\n===War of 1812===\nWilkinson was commissioned a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] during the [[War of 1812]] on March 2, 1813. That same month, Wilkinson led the American force which occupied [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[Spanish West Florida]], effectively implementing the inclusion of the [[Mobile District]] in the [[Mississippi Territory]].\n\nHe was then assigned to the [[St. Lawrence River]] [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]], following [[Henry Dearborn]]'s reassignment. Wilkinson engaged in two failed campaigns (the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]] and the second [[Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)|Battle of Lacolle Mills]]). He was then relieved from active duty, but he was cleared in a military inquiry. He was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815. In 1816, Wilkinson published ''Memoirs of My Own Times'', in a final attempt to clear his name.\n\n==Last years==\nAfter the end of his military career, Wilkinson was appointed as [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Envoy to Mexico]]. This was during the period of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] against Spain, which was won in 1821. In that year, Wilkinson requested a [[Mexican Texas|Texas]] land grant. While awaiting the Mexican government's approval of his land scheme, Wilkinson died in [[Mexico City]] on December 28, 1825, at the age of 68.  He was buried in Mexico City.<ref name=\"Joseph2007\" />\n\nWilkinson's involvement with the Spanish (as Agent 13) was widely suspected in his own day, but it was not proven until 1854, with Louisiana historian [[Charles Gayarr\u00e9]]'s publication of the American general's correspondence with [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]], [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]'s colonial governor between 1785 and 1791. Other historians subsequently added to the catalog of Wilkinson's treasonous activities.\n\n==Later view==\nSome 65 years after the general's misdeeds, then-Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] condemned him in print: \"In all our history, there is no more despicable character.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\"/>  Historian [[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]] characterized him as \"a general who never won a battle or lost a [[court-martial]]\", while [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] called Wilkinson \"the most consummate artist in treason that the nation ever possessed\".  [[George Rogers Clark]] biographer [[Temple Bodley]] said of Wilkinson, \"He had considerable military talent, but used it only for his own gain.\"\n\n==Legacy==\n* [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]'s downtown was created from land owned by Wilkinson, and he designed the layout. A major street, which runs along historic [[Liberty Hall (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Liberty Hall]], was named Wilkinson Street.<ref>[http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html Frankfort.ky.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108011812/http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n* [[New Orleans]] has a short street called Wilkinson named for James Wilkinson, in the [[French Quarter]] near [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Elaine Lacoste | title= Street Names & Picayune Histories of New Orleans|publisher=Ho'olauna Hawaii, Ltd.|year=1997}} {{ISBN|0-9656409-0-6}}</ref> There is also a Wilkinson Street in [[Mandeville, Louisiana]]. Many of the oldest streets in Mandeville, close to [[Lake Pontchartrain]], are named after prominent New Orleans residents of the late 18th and early 19th centuries or for [[Battle of New Orleans]] heroes.\n* [[Wilkinson County, Georgia]], is named for Wilkinson. A Georgia historical marker on the courthouse square gives a brief biography of the general and identifies him as the source of the county's name. (The entry on the county in the usually reliable reference ''Georgia Place Names'', by the late Kenneth Krakow, confuses James Wilkinson with James Marion Wilkinson, a [[Valdosta, Georgia]], politician and railroad executive, but the latter Wilkinson was born decades after the county was founded.)\n* [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], is named for General Wilkinson as well. It was there in the Old Natchez District that Wilkinson spent much of his time, allegedly plotting the Burr Conspiracy; [[Fort Adams, Mississippi|Fort Adams]] (then an important [[U.S. Army]] post) was constructed by Wilkinson as the most southwesterly point in the U.S. and the last American stop on the [[Mississippi River]] before entering [[New Spain|Spanish]] territory.\n* Wilkinson was an avid supporter of the military's short-hair codes. He attempted to prosecute Colonel [[Thomas Butler (soldier)|Thomas Butler]], a veteran of both the Revolution and the Indian wars, for keeping his long hair. Colonel Butler died before the trials closed. He never did cut his long, braided queue prior to his death and a possibly apocryphal story tells that his last request was for a hole to be drilled in his casket so that the queue could hang out and taunt Wilkinson even in death.<ref>Hickey, Donald R.  \"The United States Army Versus Long Hair: The Trials of Colonel Thomas Butler, 1801\u20131805\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 101 (October 1977): 462\u201374 (in print F146.

He served as an aide to [[Nathanael Greene]] during the [[Siege of Boston]], participated in the placing of guns on the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]] in March 1776, and following the British abandonment of Boston, went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene's staff and was given command of an infantry company.\n\nSent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for [[Benedict Arnold]]'s army besieging Quebec, he arrived just in time to witness the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General [[John Burgoyne]] \u2013 which precipitated the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became aide to Arnold just prior to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. Shortly thereafter, he left Arnold's service and became an aide to General [[Horatio Gates]] in August 1776.\n\nWhen Gates sent him to Congress with official dispatches about the victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Wilkinson kept Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he finally showed up, he embellished his own role in the victory, and was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] as a [[brigadier general]] (despite being only 20 years old at the time) on November 6, 1777, and appointed to the newly created Board of War. The promotion over more senior colonels caused an uproar among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson's gossiping seemed to indicate he was a participant in the [[Conway Cabal]], a conspiracy to replace [[George Washington]] with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]]. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was compelled to resign in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress appointed him clothier-general of the Army, but he resigned on March 27, 1781, due to his \"lack of aptitude for the job\".<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n==Kentucky ventures==\nAfter his resignation from the Continental Army, Wilkinson reluctantly became a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Pennsylvania militia]] in 1782 and also a state assemblyman in 1783, due to the wishes of George Washington.<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|62}} He moved to [[Kentucky]] (at that time, just three counties still belonging to Virginia)  in 1784, and he was active there in efforts to achieve independence from [[Virginia]].\n\nIn April 1787, Wilkinson made a highly controversial trip to [[New Orleans]], which was the capital of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial Louisiana]].<ref name=\"Linklater\" />{{rp|80}} At that time, Americans were allowed to trade on the [[Mississippi River]], but they had to pay a hefty [[tariff]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Slaughter|first=Thomas|title=The Whiskey Rebellion|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=55}}</ref>  Wilkinson met with Spanish Governor [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]] and managed to convince him to allow Kentucky to have a trading monopoly on the River; in return he promised to promote Spanish interests in the west.<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 Trailing Lewis and Clark]\".

Kentucky had very nearly achieved statehood under the old [[Articles of Confederation]], and there was widespread disappointment when this was delayed because of the new constitution.\n\nLeading up to Kentucky's seventh convention regarding separation from Virginia in November 1788, Wilkinson attempted to gauge the support for Kentucky to seek union with Spain. Wilkinson's ability to win people over with his charm and sincerity got him elected committee chairman at the convention. He advocated for Kentucky to seek independence from Virginia first, and then to consider joining the [[United States|Union of states]] as a second step. For many, joining the Union was conditional upon the Union negotiating with Spain to arrange free navigation on the Mississippi River, a contentious point which many doubted the eastern states would act upon.\n\nUnable to gather enough support for his position at the convention, Wilkinson then approached Mir\u00f3 with a proposal. His intention was to obtain a [[Land grant|grant]] of 60,000 acres (243&nbsp;km\u00b2) in the [[Yazoo lands]], at the junction of the [[Yazoo River]] and the Mississippi (near present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]). The land was to serve as payment for Wilkinson's efforts on behalf of Spain, and to serve as a refuge in the event he and his supporters had to flee from the United States. Wilkinson asked for and received a pension of $7,000 from Mir\u00f3, while requesting pensions on behalf of several prominent Kentuckians, including: [[Harry Innes]], [[Benjamin Sebastian]], [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]], [[Caleb Wallace]], [[Benjamin Logan]], [[Isaac Shelby]], [[George Muter]], [[George Nicholas]], and even [[Humphrey Marshall (Senator)|Humphrey Marshall]] (who at one time was a bitter rival of Wilkinson's).\n\nHowever, by 1788 Wilkinson had apparently lost the confidence of officials in [[Spain]]. Mir\u00f3 was not to grant any of the proposed pensions and was forbidden from giving money to support a revolution in Kentucky. Furthermore, Wilkinson continued to secretly receive funds from Spain for many years.\n\n==Second military career==\n{{Wikisource|Lieut. Colonel-commandant Wilkinson's Report, August 24, 1791}}\nIn the [[Northwest Indian War]], Colonel Wilkinson led a force of Kentucky [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] against [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] at [[Ouiatenon]] in May 1791. He commanded a follow-up [[Raid (military)|raid]] that autumn, highlighted by the [[Battle of Kenapacomaqua]]. In October he received a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] to the [[U.S. Army]] as lieutenant colonel, commandant of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)#Origins|2nd U.S. Infantry]].\n\n===Rivalry with Wayne===\nWhen the United States government reorganized the Army as the [[Legion of the United States]], President George Washington was faced with the decision of whom to name as its commanding general. The two major candidates for this promotion were Wilkinson and [[Anthony Wayne]]. In the end, the cabinet chose Wayne due to Wilkinson's suspected involvement with the Spanish government. The cabinet promoted Wilkinson to brigadier general as consolation, since the President was aware of Wilkinson's fragile ego.\n\nWilkinson developed a jealousy of Wayne, but he maintained an ostensible respect toward the general. However, upon Wilkinson's refusal of an invitation to Wayne's Christmas party, Wayne developed a full-fledged hatred for Wilkinson, deeming the refusal to be an act of disrespect. For example, Wayne had led the Legion Army against the Native Americans in the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in August 1794. This battle was a huge victory for the United States, yet Wilkinson had criticized General Wayne's actions during the battle, simply to antagonize him.\n\nWilkinson proceeded to file formal complaints with President Washington, against Wayne and his decisions. Upon finding out about the complaints against him, Wayne decided to fight back, launching an investigation into Wilkinson's history with the Spanish. During all of this time, Wilkinson had renewed his secret alliance with the Spanish government (through the Governor of Louisiana [[Francisco Luis H\u00e9ctor de Carondelet]]), alerting them to the actions of both the US and the French occupancy in North America. When Spanish couriers were intercepted carrying payments for Wilkinson, Wayne's suspicions were confirmed and he attempted to [[court martial]] Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]], which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to them in return for large sums in gold, but most of his information was of little value.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\">Nelson, 1999</ref>\n\n===Quasi-War with France===\nWilkinson was transferred to the southern frontier in 1798. During the [[Quasi-War]] crisis of the late 1790s between [[French First Republic|France]] and the United States, he was given the third-place rank in the U.S. Army behind [[George Washington]] (who, having been succeeded as President by [[John Adams|Adams]], died in December 1799) and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Among other duties, Wilkinson was charged by Hamilton with establishing a \"Reserve Corps\" of American troops in the lower Ohio River Valley, who would seize the lower Mississippi River Valley and New Orleans in the event of war with France and her ally Spain.\n\nDespite the end of the crisis in mid-1800 and Hamilton being discharged from the Army, Wilkinson, for unknown reasons, continued the plan for the establishment of the base which he named \"Cantonment Wilkinson\" after himself. Located in the [[Indiana Territory]] (now southern [[Illinois]]), the base operated from January 1801 to late 1802 before finally being abandoned. Archaeologists from [[Southern Illinois University]] have located the remains of this base, which is producing much previously-unknown information and artifacts from the daily life of the frontier army.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cantonment Wilkinson (Helm) Site, Pulaski County, Illinois |url=https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |accessdate=2010-07-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723041340/https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |archivedate=2015-07-23 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm \"Ohio River Valley Forts: Cantonment Wilkinsonville\", ''Southernmost Illinois History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802234937/http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm |date=2010-08-02 }}</ref>\n\nWilkinson served his second, longer term as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]] from June 15, 1800, until January 27, 1812, when former Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]] was promoted to [[major general]] over Wilkinson.\n\n===Service under President Jefferson===\nWilkinson remained senior officer of the United States Army under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Along with Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Wilkinson shared the honor of taking possession of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] on behalf of the United States in 1803. At this time, Wilkinson renewed his treasonous relationship with Spanish colonial officials, offering advice to them on how to contain American expansion in exchange for the restoration of his pension. Among other things, Wilkinson tipped off the Spanish to the object of the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] and provided advice to the [[Sebasti\u00e1n Calvo de la Puerta, 1st Marquess of Casa Calvo|Marquess of Casa Calvo]] to aid in his negotiations over the Texas\u2013Louisiana border.<ref name=\"Cox1914\">{{cite journal|title=General Wilkinson and His Later Intrigues With the Spaniards|last=Cox|first=Isaac Joslin|date=July 1914|journal=American Historical Review|volume=XIX|issue=4|pages=794\u2013812|url=https://archive.org/details/generalwilkinson01coxi/}}</ref>\n\n===Connections with Aaron Burr===\nIn 1804\u201305, he met in person with [[Aaron Burr]] and they exchanged letters regarding [[Burr conspiracy|Burr's conspiracy]].  After Burr's arrest he claimed he was leading a group of settlers to take up residence on land in Texas which he had leased from the Spanish government in Mexico, while the government charged him with treason and claimed he intended to separate the then-western states and territories from the United States and establish an independent nation.\n\nWilkinson was both the senior brigadier general of the United States Army and the first [[List of Governors of Missouri|Governor of Louisiana Territory]], which made him someone whose support Burr would cultivate. In 1806 Burr is supposed to have sent a coded, unsigned letter (the \"Cipher Letter\", which Burr later denied having written) to Wilkinson, which stated that he was ready to commence his movement to Texas.  Burr's subsequent efforts to recruit participants in his plans became public, raising fears that he was conspiring with England to start a war with Spain.  Wilkinson became fearful that his role in Burr's plans and/or his spying for Spain would be exposed.  In October 1806 Wilkinson sent to President Jefferson a letter in which he painted Burr's actions in the worst possible light, while portraying himself as innocent of any involvement. Jefferson ordered Burr's arrest, and Burr was apprehended near [[Natchez, Mississippi]].\n\nWilkinson testified at Burr's trial, and the documents presented as evidence included the \"cipher letter\", which Wilkinson had given the prosecution.  However the letter was clearly altered to minimize Wilkinson's culpability.  This forgery, coupled with Wilkinson's obviously self-serving testimony, had the effect of making Burr seem to be the victim of an overzealous government.  The grand jury nearly produced enough votes in favor of indicting Wilkinson for [[misprision of treason]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Matthew L. |last2=Buckley |first2=Jay H. |date=2012 |title=Zebulon Pike, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Txq4Oh2NjTQC&pg=PA213 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=213 |isbn=978-0-8061-4243-2}}</ref> and foreman [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] said of Wilkinson that he was a \"mammoth of iniquity\", the \"most finished scoundrel\", and \"the only man I ever saw who was from the bark to the very core a villain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Isenberg |first=Nancy |date=2004 |title=Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBS8JwARKdkC&pg=PA148 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=148 |isbn=978-0-8078-2889-2}}</ref>\n\nDuring Burr's trial, Wilkinson placed New Orleans under martial law, against the will of [[William C. C. Claiborne|Governor Claiborne]],<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Wilkinson</ref> and imprisoned several people whom he thought may be able to connect him to Burr, along with attorneys who tried to defend them.<ref>https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/founding-traitor/</ref>\n\nHe was removed from the Territorial Governor's office after being publicly criticized for heavy-handed administration and abuse of power (and replaced with [[Meriwether Lewis]]). In addition, his actions around the Burr conspiracy became public, which aroused the public against him and led to two Congressional inquiries into his private ventures and intrigues.  President [[James Madison]], who had succeeded Jefferson in 1809, ordered a military court of inquiry in 1811, which resulted in a [[court-martial]] that exonerated Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\"/>\n\n===War of 1812===\nWilkinson was commissioned a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] during the [[War of 1812]] on March 2, 1813. That same month, Wilkinson led the American force which occupied [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[Spanish West Florida]], effectively implementing the inclusion of the [[Mobile District]] in the [[Mississippi Territory]].\n\nHe was then assigned to the [[St. Lawrence River]] [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]], following [[Henry Dearborn]]'s reassignment. Wilkinson engaged in two failed campaigns (the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]] and the second [[Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)|Battle of Lacolle Mills]]). He was then relieved from active duty, but he was cleared in a military inquiry. He was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815. In 1816, Wilkinson published ''Memoirs of My Own Times'', in a final attempt to clear his name.\n\n==Last years==\nAfter the end of his military career, Wilkinson was appointed as [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Envoy to Mexico]]. This was during the period of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] against Spain, which was won in 1821. In that year, Wilkinson requested a [[Mexican Texas|Texas]] land grant. While awaiting the Mexican government's approval of his land scheme, Wilkinson died in [[Mexico City]] on December 28, 1825, at the age of 68.  He was buried in Mexico City.<ref name=\"Joseph2007\" />\n\nWilkinson's involvement with the Spanish (as Agent 13) was widely suspected in his own day, but it was not proven until 1854, with Louisiana historian [[Charles Gayarr\u00e9]]'s publication of the American general's correspondence with [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]], [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]'s colonial governor between 1785 and 1791. Other historians subsequently added to the catalog of Wilkinson's treasonous activities.\n\n==Later view==\nSome 65 years after the general's misdeeds, then-Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] condemned him in print: \"In all our history, there is no more despicable character.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\"/>  Historian [[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]] characterized him as \"a general who never won a battle or lost a [[court-martial]]\", while [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] called Wilkinson \"the most consummate artist in treason that the nation ever possessed\".  [[George Rogers Clark]] biographer [[Temple Bodley]] said of Wilkinson, \"He had considerable military talent, but used it only for his own gain.\"\n\n==Legacy==\n* [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]'s downtown was created from land owned by Wilkinson, and he designed the layout. A major street, which runs along historic [[Liberty Hall (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Liberty Hall]], was named Wilkinson Street.<ref>[http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html Frankfort.ky.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108011812/http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n* [[New Orleans]] has a short street called Wilkinson named for James Wilkinson, in the [[French Quarter]] near [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Elaine Lacoste | title= Street Names & Picayune Histories of New Orleans|publisher=Ho'olauna Hawaii, Ltd.|year=1997}} {{ISBN|0-9656409-0-6}}</ref> There is also a Wilkinson Street in [[Mandeville, Louisiana]]. Many of the oldest streets in Mandeville, close to [[Lake Pontchartrain]], are named after prominent New Orleans residents of the late 18th and early 19th centuries or for [[Battle of New Orleans]] heroes.\n* [[Wilkinson County, Georgia]], is named for Wilkinson. A Georgia historical marker on the courthouse square gives a brief biography of the general and identifies him as the source of the county's name. (The entry on the county in the usually reliable reference ''Georgia Place Names'', by the late Kenneth Krakow, confuses James Wilkinson with James Marion Wilkinson, a [[Valdosta, Georgia]], politician and railroad executive, but the latter Wilkinson was born decades after the county was founded.)\n* [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], is named for General Wilkinson as well. It was there in the Old Natchez District that Wilkinson spent much of his time, allegedly plotting the Burr Conspiracy; [[Fort Adams, Mississippi|Fort Adams]] (then an important [[U.S. Army]] post) was constructed by Wilkinson as the most southwesterly point in the U.S. and the last American stop on the [[Mississippi River]] before entering [[New Spain|Spanish]] territory.\n* Wilkinson was an avid supporter of the military's short-hair codes. He attempted to prosecute Colonel [[Thomas Butler (soldier)|Thomas Butler]], a veteran of both the Revolution and the Indian wars, for keeping his long hair. Colonel Butler died before the trials closed. He never did cut his long, braided queue prior to his death and a possibly apocryphal story tells that his last request was for a hole to be drilled in his casket so that the queue could hang out and taunt Wilkinson even in death.<ref>Hickey, Donald R.  \"The United States Army Versus Long Hair: The Trials of Colonel Thomas Butler, 1801\u20131805\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 101 (October 1977): 462\u201374 (in print F146.

The two most common forms are the ''half niqab'' and the ''gulf-style'' or ''full niqab''.\n\nThe ''half niqab'' is a simple length of fabric with elastic or ties and is worn around the face. This garment typically leaves the eyes and part of the forehead visible.\n\nThe ''gulf-style'' or ''full niqab'' completely covers the face. It consists of an upper band that is tied around the forehead, together with a long wide piece of fabric which covers the face, leaving an opening for the eyes. Many full niqab have two or more sheer layers attached to the upper band, which can be worn flipped down to cover the eyes or left over the top of the head. While a person looking at a woman wearing a niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.\n\nOther less common and more cultural or national forms of niqab include the Afghan style [[burqa]], a long pleated gown that extends from the head to the feet with a small crocheted grille over the face. The ''Pak [[Chador]]'' is a relatively new style from Pakistan, which consists of a large triangular scarf with two additional pieces.<ref name=\"mm\"/> A thin band on one edge is tied behind the head so as to keep the chador on, and then another larger rectangular piece is attached to one end of the triangle and is worn over the face, and the simple ''hij\u0101b'' wrapped, pinned or tied in a certain way so as to cover the wearer's face.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nOther common styles of clothing popularly worn with a ''niqab'' in Western countries include the [[khimar]], a semi-circular flare of fabric with an opening for the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the ''niqab''. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many ''munaqqab\u0101t'' believe no part of the skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because they do not want to be put in a position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most ''munaqqab\u0101t'' also wear an overgarment ([[jilbab]], [[abaya]] etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==In different countries==\n{{see also|Hijab by country}}\n[[File:Woman wearing battula.jpg|thumb|An [[Iranian Arab]] wearing a ''niqab'' in [[Bandar Abbas]], southern Iran]]\n[[File:Young Saudi Arabian woman in Abha.jpg|thumb|Woman in Saudi Arabia wearing a ''niqab'']]\n[[File:Yemeni doctor.jpg|thumb|Woman in Yemen wearing a ''niqab'']]\n[[File:EFatima in UAE with niqab.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a ''niqab'' in the United Arab Emirates]]\n\n===Egypt===\nThe [[niqab in Egypt]] has a complex and long history. On 8 October 2009, Egypt's top Islamic school and the world's leading school of Sunni Islam, Al-Azhar, banned the wearing of the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes.<ref name=Egypt>{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/10/08/87407.html|title=Al-Azhar bans \"niqab\" in classrooms, dormitories|author=Ahmed al-Sayyed|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=13 July 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004053418/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/10/08/87407.html|archivedate=4 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Iran===\nThe niqab was traditionally worn in Southern Iran from the arrival of [[Islam]] until the end of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era. There were many regional variations of niqab, which were also called [[ruband]] or [[pushiye]]. Traditionally, Iranian women wore [[chador|chadors]] long before Islam arrived.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe 20th century ruler, [[Reza Shah]], banned all variations of face veil in 1936, as incompatible with his modernistic ambitions. Reza Shah ordered the police to arrest women who wore the niqab and to remove their face veils by force. This policy outraged the clerics who believed it was obligatory for women to cover their faces. Many women gathered at the [[Goharshad Mosque]] in [[Mashhad]] with their faces covered to show their objection to the niqab ban.<ref>Asnad e Kashf e Hijab 24:2</ref>\n\nBetween 1941 and 1979 wearing the niqab was no longer against the law, but it was considered by the government to be a \"badge of backwardness.\" During these years, wearing the niqab and [[chador]] became much less common and instead most religious women wore headscarves only. Fashionable hotels and restaurants refused to admit women wearing niqabs. High schools and universities actively discouraged or even banned the niqab, though the headscarf was tolerated.<ref>El-Guindi, Fadwa, ''Veil: Modesty, Privacy, and Resistance'', Berg, 1999</ref>\n\nAfter the new government of 'Islamic Republic' was established, the niqab ban was not enforced by officials.\n\nIn modern Iran, the wearing of niqab is not common and is only worn by certain ethnic minorities and a minority of Arab Muslims in the southern Iranian coastal cities, such as Bandar Abbas, Minab and Bushehr.

The two most common forms are the ''half niqab'' and the ''gulf-style'' or ''full niqab''.\n\nThe ''half niqab'' is a simple length of fabric with elastic or ties and is worn around the face. This garment typically leaves the eyes and part of the forehead visible.\n\nThe ''gulf-style'' or ''full niqab'' completely covers the face. It consists of an upper band that is tied around the forehead, together with a long wide piece of fabric which covers the face, leaving an opening for the eyes. Many full niqab have two or more sheer layers attached to the upper band, which can be worn flipped down to cover the eyes or left over the top of the head. While a person looking at a woman wearing a niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.\n\nOther less common and more cultural or national forms of niqab include the Afghan style [[burqa]], a long pleated gown that extends from the head to the feet with a small crocheted grille over the face. The ''Pak [[Chador]]'' is a relatively new style from Pakistan, which consists of a large triangular scarf with two additional pieces.<ref name=\"mm\"/> A thin band on one edge is tied behind the head so as to keep the chador on, and then another larger rectangular piece is attached to one end of the triangle and is worn over the face, and the simple ''hij\u0101b'' wrapped, pinned or tied in a certain way so as to cover the wearer's face.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nOther common styles of clothing popularly worn with a ''niqab'' in Western countries include the [[khimar]], a semi-circular flare of fabric with an opening for the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the ''niqab''. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many ''munaqqab\u0101t'' believe no part of the skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because they do not want to be put in a position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most ''munaqqab\u0101t'' also wear an overgarment ([[jilbab]], [[abaya]] etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==In different countries==\n{{see also|Hijab by country}}\n[[File:Woman wearing battula.jpg|thumb|An [[Iranian Arab]] wearing a ''niqab'' in [[Bandar Abbas]], southern Iran]]\n[[File:Young Saudi Arabian woman in Abha.jpg|thumb|Woman in Saudi Arabia wearing a ''niqab'']]\n[[File:Yemeni doctor.jpg|thumb|Woman in Yemen wearing a ''niqab'']]\n[[File:EFatima in UAE with niqab.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a ''niqab'' in the United Arab Emirates]]\n\n===Egypt===\nThe [[niqab in Egypt]] has a complex and long history.

There were many regional variations of niqab, which were also called [[ruband]] or [[pushiye]]. Traditionally, Iranian women wore [[chador|chadors]] long before Islam arrived.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe 20th century ruler, [[Reza Shah]], banned all variations of face veil in 1936, as incompatible with his modernistic ambitions. Reza Shah ordered the police to arrest women who wore the niqab and to remove their face veils by force. This policy outraged the clerics who believed it was obligatory for women to cover their faces. Many women gathered at the [[Goharshad Mosque]] in [[Mashhad]] with their faces covered to show their objection to the niqab ban.<ref>Asnad e Kashf e Hijab 24:2</ref>\n\nBetween 1941 and 1979 wearing the niqab was no longer against the law, but it was considered by the government to be a \"badge of backwardness.\" During these years, wearing the niqab and [[chador]] became much less common and instead most religious women wore headscarves only. Fashionable hotels and restaurants refused to admit women wearing niqabs. High schools and universities actively discouraged or even banned the niqab, though the headscarf was tolerated.<ref>El-Guindi, Fadwa, ''Veil: Modesty, Privacy, and Resistance'', Berg, 1999</ref>\n\nAfter the new government of 'Islamic Republic' was established, the niqab ban was not enforced by officials.\n\nIn modern Iran, the wearing of niqab is not common and is only worn by certain ethnic minorities and a minority of Arab Muslims in the southern Iranian coastal cities, such as Bandar Abbas, Minab and Bushehr. Some women in the Arab-populated province of [[Khuzestan]] still wear niqab.\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn 2015, the constitutional [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] issued the [[fatwa]] that women are not required to wear niqab or cover their hands or feet under [[Shariah]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/976119/women-not-required-to-cover-faces-hands-and-feet-under-sharia-cii/|title=Women not required to cover faces, hands and feet under Sharia: CII|date=20 October 2015|publisher=[[The Express Tribune]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=1 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120212717/http://tribune.com.pk/story/976119/women-not-required-to-cover-faces-hands-and-feet-under-sharia-cii/|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nSaudi women are not required by a secular law{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} to wear the niqab.

He stopped and stared, amazed at her ravishing beauty. Once seen, Artemis got revenge on Actaeon: she forbade him speech \u2014 if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a [[Deer (mythology)|stag]] \u2014 for the unlucky profanation of her virginity's mystery. Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately transformed. At this he fled deep into the woods, and doing so he came upon a pond and, seeing his reflection, groaned. His own hounds then turned upon him and pursued him, not recognizing him. In an endeavour to save himself, he raised his eyes (and would have raised his arms, had he had them) toward Mount Olympus. The gods did not heed his plea, and he was torn to pieces. An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger. In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their master's death, that [[Chiron]] made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.<ref>Fragmentary sources for the narrative of Actaeon's hounds are noted in Lamar Ronald Lacy, \"Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26\u201342) p. 30 note 32, p. 31 note 37.</ref>\n\nThere are various other versions of his transgression: The Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' and pseudo-Apollodoran ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]'' state that his offence was that he was a rival of [[Zeus]] for [[Semele]], his mother's sister,<ref>Thus potentially endangering the future birth of [[Dionysus]], had he been successful.

Once seen, Artemis got revenge on Actaeon: she forbade him speech \u2014 if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a [[Deer (mythology)|stag]] \u2014 for the unlucky profanation of her virginity's mystery. Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately transformed. At this he fled deep into the woods, and doing so he came upon a pond and, seeing his reflection, groaned. His own hounds then turned upon him and pursued him, not recognizing him. In an endeavour to save himself, he raised his eyes (and would have raised his arms, had he had them) toward Mount Olympus. The gods did not heed his plea, and he was torn to pieces. An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger. In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their master's death, that [[Chiron]] made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.<ref>Fragmentary sources for the narrative of Actaeon's hounds are noted in Lamar Ronald Lacy, \"Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26\u201342) p. 30 note 32, p. 31 note 37.</ref>\n\nThere are various other versions of his transgression: The Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' and pseudo-Apollodoran ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]'' state that his offense was that he was a rival of [[Zeus]] for [[Semele]], his mother's sister,<ref>Thus potentially endangering the future birth of [[Dionysus]], had he been successful.
