If one finds a thimble with an irregular pattern of dimples, it was likely made before the 1850s. Another consequence of the mechanization of thimble production is that the shape and the thickness of the metal changed. Early thimbles tend to be quite thick and to have a pronounced dome on the top. The metal on later ones is thinner and the top is flatter.\n\nCollecting thimbles became popular in the UK when many companies made special thimbles to commemorate the [[Great Exhibition]] held in [[the Crystal Palace]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[London]].\nIn the 19th century, many thimbles were made from [[silver]]; however, it was found that silver is too soft a metal and can be easily punctured by most needles. [[Charles Horner (jeweller)|Charles Horner]] solved the problem by creating thimbles consisting of a steel core covered inside and out by silver, so that they retained their aesthetics but were now more practical and durable. He called his thimble the [[Dorcas]], and these are now popular with collectors. There is a small display of his work in [[Bankfield Museum]], [[West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[England]].\n\n{{gallery|align=center\n|File:Exhibition of All Nations 1851.jpg|Silver thimble commemorating the [[Great Exhibition]]\n|File:Dorcas thimble.jpg|Dorcas thimble\n}}\n\nEarly American thimbles made of whale bone or tooth featuring miniature [[scrimshaw]] designs are considered valuable collectibles.

Since then, however, they have gained many other uses.  From the 16th century onwards<ref>{{cite book|author=Holmes E.F.|title=A history of Thimbles|location=London|publisher=Cornwall Books|date= 1985}}</ref> silver thimbles were regarded as an ideal gift for ladies. \n\n[[File:Meissen thimble.jpg|thumb|150px|Meissen 'keepsake' thimble. 18th century]] \nEarly Meissen porcelain and elaborate, decorated gold thimbles were also given as 'keepsakes' and were usually quite unsuitable for sewing.  This tradition has continued to the present day. In the early modern period, thimbles were used to [[Measurement|measure]] [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], and gunpowder, which brought rise to the phrase \"just a thimbleful\".  [[Prostitution|Prostitutes]] used them in the practice of thimble-knocking where they would tap on a window to announce their presence.<ref>Dreesmann C. A thimble full.\u2026 Utrecht/Netherlands:  Cambium, 1983.  pp.75.</ref>  Thimble-knocking also refers to the practice of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] schoolmistresses who would tap on the heads of unruly pupils with dames thimbles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Thimbles-Not-as-Simple-as-they-Seem-319258.html|title=Thimbles: Not as Simple as they Seem - Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information|work=Funtrivia.com}}</ref>\n\nBefore the 18th century the small dimples on the outside of a thimble were made by hand punching, but in the middle of that century, a machine was invented to do the job. If one finds a thimble with an irregular pattern of dimples, it was likely made before the 1850s. Another consequence of the mechanization of thimble production is that the shape and the thickness of the metal changed. Early thimbles tend to be quite thick and to have a pronounced dome on the top. The metal on later ones is thinner and the top is flatter.\n\nCollecting thimbles became popular in the UK when many companies made special thimbles to commemorate the [[Great Exhibition]] held in [[the Crystal Palace]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[London]].\nIn the 19th century, many thimbles were made from [[silver]]; however, it was found that silver is too soft a metal and can be easily punctured by most needles. [[Charles Horner (jeweller)|Charles Horner]] solved the problem by creating thimbles consisting of a steel core covered inside and out by silver, so that they retained their aesthetics but were now more practical and durable. He called his thimble the [[Dorcas]], and these are now popular with collectors. There is a small display of his work in [[Bankfield Museum]], [[West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[England]].\n\n{{gallery|align=center\n|File:Exhibition of All Nations 1851.jpg|Silver thimble commemorating the [[Great Exhibition]]\n|File:Dorcas thimble.jpg|Dorcas thimble\n}}\n\nEarly American thimbles made of whale bone or tooth featuring miniature [[scrimshaw]] designs are considered valuable collectibles. Such rare thimbles are prominently featured in a number of New England Whaling Museums.<ref>The Hunt Collection, Washington Historical Society, Washington, Connecticut.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], silver thimbles were collected from \"those who had nothing to give\" by the [[British government]] and melted down to buy hospital equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findingshakespeare.co.uk/a-history-of-the-humble-thimble|title=A history of the humble thimble - Finding Shakespeare|work=Finding Shakespeare}}</ref> In the 1930s and 1940s glass-topped thimbles were used for [[advertising]].\n\nLeaving a [[sandalwood]] thimble in a fabric store was a common practice for keeping [[moth]]s away.<ref>Holmes EF.

She was [[Queen regent|regent]] of Spain during her husband's long travels in Europe during 1529-1533, 1535-1536 and 1538-1539. \n\nBorn to [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Maria of Aragon]], Isabella was the granddaughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Throughout her life, many compared her to her grandmother for her intelligence, character and determination in politics. Her personal motto was \"aut Caesar aut nihil\" ('either Cesar or nothing'). It was thanks to her governorships that Spain was able to remain independent of imperial policies.<ref>S. Jansen: The Monstrous Regiment of Women: Female Rulers in Early Modern Europe, 2002</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nIsabella was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on October 24, 1503 and named after her maternal grandmother and [[Isabella of Asturias|aunt]], who had been her father's first wife. She was the second child and eldest daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]]. Isabella was second-in-line to the throne until the birth of her brother [[Luis, Duke of Beja|Luis]] in 1506.\n\nIsabella was educated under the supervision of her mother and her governess, [[Elvira de Mendoza]]. She would progressively become an intelligent young woman, learning [[politics]], [[mathematics]], the languages of [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], [[Renaissance]] classics, and the Christian doctrine. In addition to all this, she was possessed a vast library composed of works for prayer and more mundane works which were of her taste, especially on [[cavalry]].\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the oldest daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, Isabella was a rather attractive candidate for marriage. Her mother left in her will, and in a clear message to her husband, the desire that the 14 years-old Isabella should marry only a king or the legitimate son of kings. The ideal candidate for Isabella's husband was her first cousin [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], son of Maria's sister, [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Philip I of Castile]]. A marriage would bring a strong alliance between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, in accordance with the wishes of their grandparents, Isabella and Ferdinand: It would facilitate to continue the exploration of the oceans without incurring clashes, as Portugal was the only naval power that could question Spain's supremacy in the Atlantic. As Charles was sovereign of multiple kingdoms, Spain needed allies and it was necessary that Portugal (Christendom's richest kingdom) fall under its orbit and not of France, which had happened in the [[War of Castilian Succession]]. Moreover, the nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood from the Iberian peninsula, just like Isabella.\n\nHowever, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice, instead sending his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father in 1518. Charles's Flemish advisors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], later convinced him to relegate the Portuguese alliance to the background and replace it with an alliance with England. In 1521, Charles became engaged to his other first cousin [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]], who was sixteen years younger than Charles and still a child. Their engagement sought to undo an alliance between England and France, articulated by the ambitious Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Many in Portugal took Isabella's rejection as an offence, but Isabella remained determined and hopeful that she would marry her powerful cousin: The choice was that she would marry only Charles or she would enter a convent.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could wait no longer for Mary Tudor to get older, as he was determined to have legitimate children. His engagement was called off, the alliance with England was abandoned, and Charles finally sought to marry Isabella. There were many more advantages - she was closer to him in age (she was only three years his junior), fluent in Spanish, and offered a handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds, which was more than enough to solve many of his economic and financial problems brought on by the [[Italian War of 1521-26]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=James D.|title=Emperor Charles V, Impresario of War : campaign strategy, international finance, and domestic politics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=9780521814317|page=114|edition=}}</ref> The negotiations and marriage contract for an alliance with Portugal were made - Isabella would marry Charles and her brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]].\n\n==Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Spain==\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Marriage and Honeymoon===\nIn January 1526, Isabella travelled to Spain. Upon her arrival, she met a by the [[Duke of Calabria]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] and the [[Duke of B\u00e9jar]] at the Spanish-Portuguese border. They escorted her to [[Seville]], where she was to wait for Charkes for a week. Their wedding took place that very same day just after midnight on 11 March in the Palace of [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacQuarrie|first=Kim|title=The Last Days of the Incas|url=https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1416539352|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq/page/35 35]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=A Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain, and Readers at Home: Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108037534|page=258}}</ref> \n\nAlthough their marriage was originally a political arrangement, Isabella captivated her husband with her charm and beauty. Following their wedding, the couple spent a long honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] and records show that during their honeymoon \"when [Charles and Isabella] are together, although there are many people around, they do not notice anyone else; they talk and laugh, and nothing else distracts them.\"{{quote needs citation|date=August 2018}} Charkes ordered the seeds of a Persian flower, that had never been seen before in Spain, to be planted in the gardens of the Alhambra. The seeds eventually grew into the red carnation and Isabella was so delighted by the new flower that her husband ordered thousands more to be planted in her honour. The red carnation later became Spain's [[floral emblem]].\n\n===Regency===\n[[File:Isabel de Portugal, Pompeo Leoni.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze statue of Empress Isabella by [[Leone Leoni]], 1550-1555, that was commissioned by Charles V, on display at the [[El Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIsabella proved to be a very competent politician when she served as [[List of Spanish regents|regent of Spain]] during her husband's absences due to political affairs and [[wars]] abroad between 1529\u20131532 and 1535\u20131539. She attended meetings of the governing councils, consulted with the ministers, and eventually\ntook a more active role in the policy-making process. The Emperor was impressed with many of her accomplishments and decisions.\n\nAll the documentation of the time indicates{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} that Isabella was a profound connoisseur of the problems of the peninsular kingdoms, defending intransigently the good common to particular interests. At the external level, her sensible actions were decisive in the defence of the coasts of the peninsula and of [[North Africa]], those [[investment|invested]] by [[piracy]].\n\nDuring her time as regent, Isabella traveled a lot around Spain, defending the royal power and the monarch's supreme authority. She traveled regularly in the autumn between [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Valladolid]], Seville, [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]]. To deal with important matters of the empire, Charles and Isabella wrote to each other regularly. Sometimes, the Emperor didn't write for months, to the point that the Empress \"scolded\" him in one letter, saying that at least, she would write \"every twenty days.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Life at Court===\nWhen she heard that her husband was about to return, Isabella sent receptions with large parties. However, the time she was alone with her children, [[ladies-in-waiting]], and counselors of the court, she had a simpler life.\n\nIsabella ensured that their children's educations, especially that of her son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], were very completed. She even personally taught them her native language, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n==Health and Death==\n{{cns|date=August 2018|text=Isabella suffered from [[tertian fever]]s, which became chronic later in her life. She also suffered several times from malaria, causing her health to be very fragile. Due to the very hot weather of Toledo and Seville, she spent the summers in the milder [[Avila, Spain|Avila]] because she suffered several times from illness. She had a total of seven pregnancies, out of which five were successful, and suffered two miscarriages. Her husband's absences caused her great loneliness, which some historians believe further weakened her delicate health.|reason=}} There is also speculation that Isabella may have suffered from consumption and its effects debilited her further. A contemporary described her not long before her death: \"The Empress is the greatest pity in the world; she is so thin as to not resemble a person.\"\n\nIn 1539, Isabella became pregnant for the seventh time, but in the third month of the pregnancy she contracted another fever that caused antenatal complications and gave birth to a stillborn son. She died two weeks later on 1 May 1539 at the age of 35.<ref>Geoffrey Parker (2014), ''Imprudent King: A New Life of Philip II'', New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 12. {{ISBN|9780300196535}}</ref> The Emperor was left so devastated by his wife's death that he couldn't bring himself to accompany her body to the [[Royal Chapel of Granada]], the burial place of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. Instead, he instructed their son Philip to accompany his mother's body with [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda]]. When Borgia conveyed Isabella's remains and saw the effects of [[decomposition]] on the beautiful empress, he decided to \"never again serve a mortal master\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After his own wife's death in 1541, Borgia retired from court and became a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn the aftermath, Charles locked himself up in a monastery for two months, where he prayed and mourned for his wife alone, but never recovered from Isabella's death; he never remarried and dressed in black for the rest of his life. He died on 21 September 1558, holding in his hand the cross that his wife had been holding when she died.\n\n===Post-mortem Tributes and Reburials===\n[[File:La Gloria (Tiziano).jpg|thumb|right|Titian's ''La Gloria'', one of the several paintings commissioned by Charles V in memory of his wife Isabella]]\nIn memory of Isabella, Charles commissioned several tributes through art and music, beginning in 1540 when he commissioned the Flemish composer [[Thomas Crecquillon]] to compose new music in honour of the Empress. Crecquillon composed his ''Missa Mort m'a priv\u00e9'' as a memorial to Isabella, which expresses the Emperor's grief and great wish for a heavenly reunion with his beloved wife.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography/thomas-crecquillon-missa-mort-ma-prive-motets-and-chansons/|title= Thomas Crecquillon: Missa 'Mort m\u2019a priv\u00e9', motets and chansons|last=Ham |first=Martin |date=2006 |website= The Brabant Ensemble| access-date=23 October 2018}}\n</ref> Another musical tribute to Isabella is ''Carole cur defles Isabellam'' that was composed in 1545 by the Franco-Flemish composer [[Nicolas Payen]].\n\nIn 1543, Charles commissioned his favourite painter [[Titian]] to paint posthumous portraits of Isabella by using earlier ones of her as his model. Titian painted several portraits of the Empress, which included his ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal|Portrait of The Empress Isabel of Portugal]]'' and ''[[La Gloria (Titian)|La Gloria]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-glory/66149817-6f88-4e5f-a09a-81f63a84d145|title= The Glory.  1551 \u2013 1554.

This was done in accordance with Charles's last will and testament, in which he left a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he and Isabella would be reburied together side by side, \"half-body under the altar and half under the priest's feet\". They remained in the Royal Chapel while the famous Basilica of the Monastery and the Royal Crypt were still under construction.\n\nIn 1654, after the Basilica and Royal Crypt were finally completed during the reign of their great-grandson [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the remains of Charles and Isabella were moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings, which lies directly under the Basilica.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delacuadra.net/escorial/textos/1997c-a-panteo.pdf |title=A-Panteo.Pdf |date= |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]] and Charles's sisters, [[Eleanor of Austria]] and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Maria of Hungary]], behind them.

She was [[Queen regent|regent]] of Spain during her husband's long travels in Europe during 1529-1533, 1535-1536 and 1538-1539. \n\nBorn to [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and [[Maria of Aragon]], Isabella was the granddaughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Throughout her life, many compared her to her grandmother for her intelligence, character and determination in politics. Her personal motto was \"aut Caesar aut nihil\" ('either Cesar or nothing'). It was thanks to her governorships that Spain was able to remain independent of imperial policies.<ref>S. Jansen: The Monstrous Regiment of Women: Female Rulers in Early Modern Europe, 2002</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nIsabella was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on October 24, 1503 and named after her maternal grandmother and [[Isabella of Asturias|aunt]], who had been her father's first wife. She was the second child and eldest daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]]. Isabella was second-in-line to the throne until the birth of her brother [[Luis, Duke of Beja|Luis]] in 1506.\n\nIsabella was educated under the supervision of her mother and her governess, [[Elvira de Mendoza]]. She would progressively become an intelligent young woman, learning [[politics]], [[mathematics]], the languages of [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], [[Renaissance]] classics, and the Christian doctrine. In addition to all this, she was possessed a vast library composed of works for prayer and more mundane works which were of her taste, especially on [[cavalry]].\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the oldest daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, Isabella was a rather attractive candidate for marriage. Her mother left in her will, and in a clear message to her husband, the desire that the 14 years-old Isabella should marry only a king or the legitimate son of kings. The ideal candidate for Isabella's husband was her first cousin [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], son of Maria's sister, [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Philip I of Castile]]. A marriage would bring a strong alliance between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, in accordance with the wishes of their grandparents, Isabella and Ferdinand: It would facilitate to continue the exploration of the oceans without incurring clashes, as Portugal was the only naval power that could question Spain's supremacy in the Atlantic. As Charles was sovereign of multiple kingdoms, Spain needed allies and it was necessary that Portugal (Christendom's richest kingdom) fall under its orbit and not of France, which had happened in the [[War of Castilian Succession]]. Moreover, the nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood from the Iberian peninsula, just like Isabella.\n\nHowever, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice, instead sending his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father in 1518. Charles's Flemish advisors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], later convinced him to relegate the Portuguese alliance to the background and replace it with an alliance with England. In 1521, Charles became engaged to his other first cousin [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]], who was sixteen years younger than Charles and still a child. Their engagement sought to undo an alliance between England and France, articulated by the ambitious Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Many in Portugal took Isabella's rejection as an offence, but Isabella remained determined and hopeful that she would marry her powerful cousin: The choice was that she would marry only Charles or she would enter a convent.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could wait no longer for Mary Tudor to get older, as he was determined to have legitimate children. His engagement was called off, the alliance with England was abandoned, and Charles finally sought to marry Isabella. There were many more advantages - she was closer to him in age (she was only three years his junior), fluent in Spanish, and offered a handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds, which was more than enough to solve many of his economic and financial problems brought on by the [[Italian War of 1521-26]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=James D.|title=Emperor Charles V, Impresario of War : campaign strategy, international finance, and domestic politics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=9780521814317|page=114|edition=}}</ref> The negotiations and marriage contract for an alliance with Portugal were made - Isabella would marry Charles and her brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]].\n\n==Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Spain==\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Marriage and Honeymoon===\nIn January 1526, Isabella travelled to Spain. Upon her arrival, she met a by the [[Duke of Calabria]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] and the [[Duke of B\u00e9jar]] at the Spanish-Portuguese border. They escorted her to [[Seville]], where she was to wait for Charkes for a week. Their wedding took place that very same day just after midnight on 11 March in the Palace of [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacQuarrie|first=Kim|title=The Last Days of the Incas|url=https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1416539352|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq/page/35 35]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=A Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain, and Readers at Home: Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108037534|page=258}}</ref> \n\nAlthough their marriage was originally a political arrangement, Isabella captivated her husband with her charm and beauty. Following their wedding, the couple spent a long honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] and records show that during their honeymoon \"when [Charles and Isabella] are together, although there are many people around, they do not notice anyone else; they talk and laugh, and nothing else distracts them.\"{{quote needs citation|date=August 2018}} Charkes ordered the seeds of a Persian flower, that had never been seen before in Spain, to be planted in the gardens of the Alhambra. The seeds eventually grew into the red carnation and Isabella was so delighted by the new flower that her husband ordered thousands more to be planted in her honour. The red carnation later became Spain's [[floral emblem]].\n\n===Regency===\n[[File:Isabel de Portugal, Pompeo Leoni.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze statue of Empress Isabella by [[Leone Leoni]], 1550-1555, that was commissioned by Charles V, on display at the [[El Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIsabella proved to be a very competent politician when she served as [[List of Spanish regents|regent of Spain]] during her husband's absences due to political affairs and [[wars]] abroad between 1529\u20131532 and 1535\u20131539. She attended meetings of the governing councils, consulted with the ministers, and eventually\ntook a more active role in the policy-making process. The Emperor was impressed with many of her accomplishments and decisions.\n\nAll the documentation of the time indicates{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} that Isabella was a profound connoisseur of the problems of the peninsular kingdoms, defending intransigently the good common to particular interests. At the external level, her sensible actions were decisive in the defence of the coasts of the peninsula and of [[North Africa]], those [[investment|invested]] by [[piracy]].\n\nDuring her time as regent, Isabella traveled a lot around Spain, defending the royal power and the monarch's supreme authority. She traveled regularly in the autumn between [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Valladolid]], Seville, [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]]. To deal with important matters of the empire, Charles and Isabella wrote to each other regularly. Sometimes, the Emperor didn't write for months, to the point that the Empress \"scolded\" him in one letter, saying that at least, she would write \"every twenty days.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Life at Court===\nWhen she heard that her husband was about to return, Isabella sent receptions with large parties. However, the time she was alone with her children, [[ladies-in-waiting]], and counselors of the court, she had a simpler life.\n\nIsabella ensured that their children's educations, especially that of her son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], were very completed. She even personally taught them her native language, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n==Health and Death==\n{{cns|date=August 2018|text=Isabella suffered from [[tertian fever]]s, which became chronic later in her life. She also suffered several times from malaria, causing her health to be very fragile. Due to the very hot weather of Toledo and Seville, she spent the summers in the milder [[Avila, Spain|Avila]] because she suffered several times from illness. She had a total of seven pregnancies, out of which five were successful, and suffered two miscarriages. Her husband's absences caused her great loneliness, which some historians believe further weakened her delicate health.|reason=}} There is also speculation that Isabella may have suffered from consumption and its effects debilited her further. A contemporary described her not long before her death: \"The Empress is the greatest pity in the world; she is so thin as to not resemble a person.\"\n\nIn 1539, Isabella became pregnant for the seventh time, but in the third month of the pregnancy she contracted another fever that caused antenatal complications and gave birth to a stillborn son. She died two weeks later on 1 May 1539 at the age of 35.<ref>Geoffrey Parker (2014), ''Imprudent King: A New Life of Philip II'', New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 12. {{ISBN|9780300196535}}</ref> The Emperor was left so devastated by his wife's death that he couldn't bring himself to accompany her body to the [[Royal Chapel of Granada]], the burial place of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. Instead, he instructed their son Philip to accompany his mother's body with [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda]]. When Borgia conveyed Isabella's remains and saw the effects of [[decomposition]] on the beautiful empress, he decided to \"never again serve a mortal master\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After his own wife's death in 1541, Borgia retired from court and became a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn the aftermath, Charles locked himself up in a monastery for two months, where he prayed and mourned for his wife alone, but never recovered from Isabella's death; he never remarried and dressed in black for the rest of his life. He died on 21 September 1558, holding in his hand the cross that his wife had been holding when she died.\n\n===Post-mortem Tributes and Reburials===\n[[File:La Gloria (Tiziano).jpg|thumb|right|Titian's ''La Gloria'', one of the several paintings commissioned by Charles V in memory of his wife Isabella]]\nIn memory of Isabella, Charles commissioned several tributes through art and music, beginning in 1540 when he commissioned the Flemish composer [[Thomas Crecquillon]] to compose new music in honour of the Empress. Crecquillon composed his ''Missa Mort m'a priv\u00e9'' as a memorial to Isabella, which expresses the Emperor's grief and great wish for a heavenly reunion with his beloved wife.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography/thomas-crecquillon-missa-mort-ma-prive-motets-and-chansons/|title= Thomas Crecquillon: Missa 'Mort m\u2019a priv\u00e9', motets and chansons|last=Ham |first=Martin |date=2006 |website= The Brabant Ensemble| access-date=23 October 2018}}\n</ref> Another musical tribute to Isabella is ''Carole cur defles Isabellam'' that was composed in 1545 by the Franco-Flemish composer [[Nicolas Payen]].\n\nIn 1543, Charles commissioned his favourite painter [[Titian]] to paint posthumous portraits of Isabella by using earlier ones of her as his model. Titian painted several portraits of the Empress, which included his ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal|Portrait of The Empress Isabel of Portugal]]'' and ''[[La Gloria (Titian)|La Gloria]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-glory/66149817-6f88-4e5f-a09a-81f63a84d145|title= The Glory.  1551 \u2013 1554.

This was done in accordance with Charles's last will and testament, in which he left a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he and Isabella would be reburied together side by side, \"half-body under the altar and half under the priest's feet\". They remained in the Royal Chapel while the famous Basilica of the Monastery and the Royal Crypt were still under construction.\n\nIn 1654, after the Basilica and Royal Crypt were finally completed during the reign of their great-grandson [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the remains of Charles and Isabella were moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings, which lies directly under the Basilica.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delacuadra.net/escorial/textos/1997c-a-panteo.pdf |title=A-Panteo.Pdf |date= |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]] and Charles's sisters, [[Eleanor of Austria]] and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Maria of Hungary]], behind them.

Katzman writes that their ideology \"espoused the creation of a [[classless society]] that would combat world [[imperialism]], international [[Zionism]], [[colonialism]], exploitation, racism, and multinational corporations\".{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}} The MEK\u2019s ideological foundation was developed during the period of the Iran revolution. According to its official history, the MEK first defined itself as a group that wanted to establish a nationalist, democratic, revolutionary Muslim organization in favour of change in Iran.<ref>{{citejournal |last1=Gardu\u00f1o |first1=Moises |year=2016 |title= LA ARTICULACI\u00d3N DE INTERESES DE LOS MO\u0232\u0100HED\u012aN-EJALQ-E IRAN: DE LA REVOLUCI\u00d3N ISL\u00c1MICA AL MOVIMIENTO VERDE |journal= Estudios de Asia y Africa |volume=51 |issue=1 |page = 105-135 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> \n\nHistorian Ervand Abrahamian observed that the MEK were \"consciously influenced by Marxism, both [[Neo-Marxism|modern]] and [[Classical Marxism|classical]]\", but they always denied being Marxists because they were aware that the term was colloquial to '[[atheistic]] materialism' among Iran's general public. The Iranian regime for the same reason was \"eager to pin on the Mojahedin the labels of Islamic-Marxists and Marxist-Muslims\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nAccording to Abrahamian, it was the first Iranian organization to develop systematically a modern revolutionary interpretation of Islam that \"differed sharply from both the old conservative Islam of the traditional clergy and the new populist version formulated in the 1970s by Ayatollah Khomeini and his disciples\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=1}} According to James Piazza, the MEK worked towards the creation by armed popular struggle of a society in which ethnic, gender, or class discrimination would be obliterated.{{sfn|Piazza|1994|pp=9\u201343}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the MEK denied government allegations that it had espoused Marxism as ideology. Nasser Sadegh told military tribunals that although the MEK respected Marxism as a \"progressive method of social analysis, they could not accept materialism, which was contrary to their Islamic ideology\". The MEK eventually had a falling out with Marxist groups. According to Sepehr Zabir, \"they soon became Enemy No. 1 of both pro-Soviet Marxist groups, the Tudeh and the Majority Fedayeen\".<ref name=\"auto30\"/>\n\nAbrahamian said that the MEK's early ideology constituted a \"combination of Muslim themes; Shii notions of martyrdom; classical Marxist theories of class struggle and historical determinism; and neo-Marxist concepts of armed struggle, guerilla warfare and revolutionary heroism\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=100}} However, the MEK claim that this misrepresents their ideology in that Marxism and Islam are incompatible, and that the MEK has always emphasized Islam.{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}}\n\nThe MEK's ideology of revolutionary [[Twelver|Shiaism]] is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of [[Ali Shariati]] that \"many concluded\" they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that \"in later years\" that Shariati and \"his prolific works\" had \"indirectly helped the Mujahedin\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=490}}\n\nIn the group's \"first major ideological work\", ''Nahzat-i Husseini'' or [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s Movement, authored by one of the group's founders, Ahmad Reza'i, it was argued that ''Nezam-i Towhid'' (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. \"Shiism, particularly Hussein's historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=491}}\n\nAs described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued\n\n<blockquote>Reza'i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi'i [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imams]], especially [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphs]] who betrayed the ''Nezam-i-Towhid''. For Reza'i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all muslims to continue this struggle to create a '[[classless society]]' and destroy all forms of [[capitalism]], [[despotism]], and [[imperialism]]. The Mujahidin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: 'After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi'i ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi'ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi'ism, particularly [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.<ref>Keddle, Nikki R.

It smacked of wife-swapping, especially when Abrishamchi announced his own marriage to Khiabani\u2019s younger sister. It involved women with young children and wives of close friends \u2013 a taboo in traditional Iranian culture;\" something that further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. Also according to [[Ervand Abrahamian]], \"the incident was equally outrageous in the eyes of the secularists, especially among the modern intelligentsia. It projected onto the public arena a matter that should have been treated as a private issue between two individuals.\"{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu's giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} \n\n[[Maryam Rajavi]] became increasingly important over feminism-colored politics. The emancipation of women is now depicted in Maryam Rajavi's writings \"as both a policy end and a strategy toward revolutionizing Iran. Secularism, democracy, and women's rights are thus today's leading themes in the group's strategic communications. As for Maryam Rajavi's leadership, in 2017 it appears to be political and cultural; any remnants of a military force and interest in terrorist strategies have faded away.\"{{sfn|Harmon|Bowdish|2018|p=166}}\n\nAccording to [[Country Reports on Terrorism]], in 1990 the second phase of the 'ideological revolution' was announced during which all married members were ordered to [[divorce]] and remain celibate, undertaking a vow of \"eternal divorce\", with the exception of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi.

Katzman writes that their ideology \"espoused the creation of a [[classless society]] that would combat world [[imperialism]], international [[Zionism]], [[colonialism]], exploitation, racism, and multinational corporations\".{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}} The MEK\u2019s ideological foundation was developed during the period of the Iran revolution. According to its official history, the MEK first defined itself as a group that wanted to establish a nationalist, democratic, revolutionary Muslim organization in favour of change in Iran.<ref>{{citejournal |last1=Gardu\u00f1o |first1=Moises |year=2016 |title= LA ARTICULACI\u00d3N DE INTERESES DE LOS MO\u0232\u0100HED\u012aN-EJALQ-E IRAN: DE LA REVOLUCI\u00d3N ISL\u00c1MICA AL MOVIMIENTO VERDE |journal= Estudios de Asia y Africa |volume=51 |issue=1 |page = 105-135 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> \n\nHistorian Ervand Abrahamian observed that the MEK were \"consciously influenced by Marxism, both [[Neo-Marxism|modern]] and [[Classical Marxism|classical]]\", but they always denied being Marxists because they were aware that the term was colloquial to '[[atheistic]] materialism' among Iran's general public. The Iranian regime for the same reason was \"eager to pin on the Mojahedin the labels of Islamic-Marxists and Marxist-Muslims\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nAccording to Abrahamian, it was the first Iranian organization to develop systematically a modern revolutionary interpretation of Islam that \"differed sharply from both the old conservative Islam of the traditional clergy and the new populist version formulated in the 1970s by Ayatollah Khomeini and his disciples\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=1}} According to James Piazza, the MEK worked towards the creation by armed popular struggle of a society in which ethnic, gender, or class discrimination would be obliterated.{{sfn|Piazza|1994|pp=9\u201343}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the MEK denied government allegations that it had espoused Marxism as ideology. Nasser Sadegh told military tribunals that although the MEK respected Marxism as a \"progressive method of social analysis, they could not accept materialism, which was contrary to their Islamic ideology\". The MEK eventually had a falling out with Marxist groups. According to Sepehr Zabir, \"they soon became Enemy No. 1 of both pro-Soviet Marxist groups, the Tudeh and the Majority Fedayeen\".<ref name=\"auto30\"/>\n\nAbrahamian said that the MEK's early ideology constituted a \"combination of Muslim themes; Shii notions of martyrdom; classical Marxist theories of class struggle and historical determinism; and neo-Marxist concepts of armed struggle, guerilla warfare and revolutionary heroism\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=100}} However, the MEK claim that this misrepresents their ideology in that Marxism and Islam are incompatible, and that the MEK has always emphasized Islam.{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}}\n\nThe MEK's ideology of revolutionary [[Twelver|Shiaism]] is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of [[Ali Shariati]] that \"many concluded\" they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that \"in later years\" that Shariati and \"his prolific works\" had \"indirectly helped the Mujahedin\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=490}}\n\nIn the group's \"first major ideological work\", ''Nahzat-i Husseini'' or [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s Movement, authored by one of the group's founders, Ahmad Reza'i, it was argued that ''Nezam-i Towhid'' (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. \"Shiism, particularly Hussein's historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=491}}\n\nAs described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued\n\n<blockquote>Reza'i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi'i [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imams]], especially [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphs]] who betrayed the ''Nezam-i-Towhid''. For Reza'i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all muslims to continue this struggle to create a '[[classless society]]' and destroy all forms of [[capitalism]], [[despotism]], and [[imperialism]]. The Mujahidin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: 'After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi'i ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi'ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi'ism, particularly [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.<ref>Keddle, Nikki R.

It involved women with young children and wives of close friends \u2013 a taboo in traditional Iranian culture;\" something that further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. Also according to [[Ervand Abrahamian]], \"the incident was equally outrageous in the eyes of the secularists, especially among the modern intelligentsia. It projected onto the public arena a matter that should have been treated as a private issue between two individuals.\"{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu's giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} \n\n[[Maryam Rajavi]] became increasingly important over feminism-colored politics. The emancipation of women is now depicted in Maryam Rajavi's writings \"as both a policy end and a strategy toward revolutionizing Iran. Secularism, democracy, and women's rights are thus today's leading themes in the group's strategic communications. As for Maryam Rajavi's leadership, in 2017 it appears to be political and cultural; any remnants of a military force and interest in terrorist strategies have faded away.\"{{sfn|Harmon|Bowdish|2018|p=166}}\n\nAccording to [[Country Reports on Terrorism]], in 1990 the second phase of the 'ideological revolution' was announced during which all married members were ordered to [[divorce]] and remain celibate, undertaking a vow of \"eternal divorce\", with the exception of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi.
