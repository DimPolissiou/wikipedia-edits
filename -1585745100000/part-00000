Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian [[Software repository|repositories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian |title=Kali's Relationship With Debian |publisher=Kali Linux |date=2013-03-11 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace their venerable [[BackTrack]] Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a genuine [[Debian]] derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nWith version 2019.4 in November 2019, the default user interface was switched from [[GNOME]] to [[Xfce]], with a GNOME version still available.<ref name=\"softpedia\">{{cite web|first1=Marius|last1=Nestor|accessdate=2019-11-29|title=Kali Linux Ethical Hacking OS Switches to Xfce Desktop, Gets New Look and Feel|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/kali-linux-ethical-hacking-os-switches-to-xfce-desktop-gets-new-look-and-feel-528328.shtml|website=softpedia}}</ref>\n\n=== Requirements ===\n*Kali Linux requires a minimum of 3GB hard disk space for installation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kali Linux Hard Disk Install |url=https://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install |website=Kali Linux Official Documentation |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n*A minimum of 512MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 architectures.\n*A bootable CD-DVD drive or a USB stick.\n\n== Recommended==\nThe recommended hardware specification for smooth run are:\n* 10 GB of hard disk space, [[SSD]] preferred\n*Minimum of 2048 MB of [[RAM]]\n\n== Supported platforms ==\nKali Linux is distributed in [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] images for use on hosts based on the [[x86]] [[instruction set]] and as an image for the [[ARM architecture]] for use on the [[Beagle Board]] computer and on Samsung's ARM [[Chromebook]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/backtrack-successor-kali-launched-336420 |title=BackTrack successor Kali Linux launched |publisher=[[SC Magazine]] |first=Darren |last=Pauli |date=2013-03-13 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe developers of Kali Linux aim to make Kali Linux available for even more ARM devices.<ref name=\"Interview with Mati\">{{cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/behind-the-app-the-story-of-kali-linux-1666168491 |title=Behind the App: The Story of Kali Linux |publisher=Lifehacker |last=Orin |first=Andy |date=2014-12-03 |access-date=2019-04-10 |quote=Mati Aharoni: One of our goals with Kali is to provide images of the operating system for all sorts of exotic hardware\u2014mainly ARM based.

This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled. However, the developers recommend that users test these features extensively before using Kali for real world forensics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-forensics-mode |title=Kali Linux Forensics Mode |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nKali Linux includes security tools, such as:<ref name=\"tools\" />\n{{div col}}\n* [[Aircrack-ng]]\n* [[Armitage (computing)|Armitage]]\n* [[Burp suite]]\n* Cisco Global Exploiter, a hacking tool used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Cisco Network systems\n* [[Ettercap (software)|Ettercap]]\n* [[Hashcat]]\n* [[John the Ripper]]\n* [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]]\n* [[Maltego]]\n* [[Metasploit]] framework\n* [[Nmap]]\n* [[OWASP ZAP]]\n* [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tools\n*[[Sqlmap]]\n* [[Wireshark]]\n*[[Hydra (software)|Hydra]]\n* [[Reverse engineering|Reverse engineering]] tools\n* [[Foremost (software)|Foremost]]\n* [[Volatility (memory forensics)|Volatility]] \n{{div col end}}\n\nThese tools can be used for a number of purposes, most of which involve exploiting a victim network or application, performing network discovery, or scanning a target IP address.

Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian [[Software repository|repositories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian |title=Kali's Relationship With Debian |publisher=Kali Linux |date=2013-03-11 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace their venerable [[BackTrack]] Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a genuine [[Debian]] derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nWith version 2019.4 in November 2019, the default user interface was switched from [[GNOME]] to [[Xfce]], with a GNOME version still available.<ref name=\"softpedia\">{{cite web|first1=Marius|last1=Nestor|accessdate=2019-11-29|title=Kali Linux Ethical Hacking OS Switches to Xfce Desktop, Gets New Look and Feel|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/kali-linux-ethical-hacking-os-switches-to-xfce-desktop-gets-new-look-and-feel-528328.shtml|website=softpedia}}</ref>\n\n=== Requirements ===\n*Kali Linux requires a minimum of 3GB hard disk space for installation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kali Linux Hard Disk Install |url=https://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install |website=Kali Linux Official Documentation |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n*A minimum of 512MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 architectures.\n*A bootable CD-DVD drive or a USB stick.\n\n== Recommended==\nThe recommended hardware specification for smooth run are:\n* 10 GB of hard disk space, [[SSD]] preferred\n*Minimum of 2048 MB of [[RAM]]\n\n== Supported platforms ==\nKali Linux is distributed in [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] images for use on hosts based on the [[x86]] [[instruction set]] and as an image for the [[ARM architecture]] for use on the [[Beagle Board]] computer and on Samsung's ARM [[Chromebook]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/backtrack-successor-kali-launched-336420 |title=BackTrack successor Kali Linux launched |publisher=[[SC Magazine]] |first=Darren |last=Pauli |date=2013-03-13 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe developers of Kali Linux aim to make Kali Linux available for even more ARM devices.<ref name=\"Interview with Mati\">{{cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/behind-the-app-the-story-of-kali-linux-1666168491 |title=Behind the App: The Story of Kali Linux |publisher=Lifehacker |last=Orin |first=Andy |date=2014-12-03 |access-date=2019-04-10 |quote=Mati Aharoni: One of our goals with Kali is to provide images of the operating system for all sorts of exotic hardware\u2014mainly ARM based.

This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled. However, the developers recommend that users test these features extensively before using Kali for real world forensics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-forensics-mode |title=Kali Linux Forensics Mode |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nKali Linux includes security tools, such as:<ref name=\"tools\" />\n{{div col}}\n* [[Aircrack-ng]]\n* [[Armitage (computing)|Armitage]]\n* [[Burp suite]]\n* Cisco Global Exploiter, a hacking tool used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Cisco Network systems\n* [[Ettercap (software)|Ettercap]]\n* [[Hashcat]]\n* [[John the Ripper]]\n* [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]]\n* [[Maltego]]\n* [[Metasploit]] framework\n* [[Nmap]]\n* [[OWASP ZAP]]\n* [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tools\n*[[Sqlmap]]\n* [[Wireshark]]\n*[[Hydra (software)|Hydra]]\n* [[Reverse engineering|Reverse engineering]] tools\n* [[Foremost (software)|Foremost]]\n* [[Volatility (memory forensics)|Volatility]] \n{{div col end}}\n\nThese tools can be used for a number of purposes, most of which involve exploiting a victim network or application, performing network discovery, or scanning a target IP address.

Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]\nThe Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to desintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.

In England, women used to wear corsets that severely constricted their breathing and damaged vital internal organs, in order to achieve a visual effect of an exaggeratedly low waist-to-hip ratio.\n\nPeople make judgments of physical attractiveness based on what they see, but also on what they know about the person. Specifically, perceptions of beauty are malleable such that information about the person's personality traits can influence one's assessment of another person's physical beauty. A 2007 study had participants first rate pictures for attractiveness. After doing distracting math problems, participants saw the pictures again, but with information about the person's personality. When participants learned that a person had positive personality characteristics (e.g., smart, funny, kind), that person was seen as more physically attractive.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Personality goes a long way: The malleability of opposite-sex physical attractiveness |first=Gary |last=Lewandowski |first2=Art |last2=Aron |first3=Julie |last3=Gee | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=14 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=571\u2013585 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.2007.00172.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9217 }}</ref> Conversely, a person with negative personality characteristics (e.g., materialistic, rude, untrustworthy) was seen as less physically attractive.

A survey conducted by [[London Guildhall University]] of 11,000 people showed that those who subjectively describe themselves as physically attractive earn more income than others who would describe themselves as less attractive.<ref name = \"Lorenz_2005\" /> People who described themselves as less attractive earned, on average, 13% less than those who described themselves as more attractive, while the penalty for being overweight was around 5%.

In England, women used to wear corsets that severely constricted their breathing and damaged vital internal organs, in order to achieve a visual effect of an exaggeratedly low waist-to-hip ratio.\n\nPeople make judgments of physical attractiveness based on what they see, but also on what they know about the person. Specifically, perceptions of beauty are malleable such that information about the person's personality traits can influence one's assessment of another person's physical beauty. A 2007 study had participants first rate pictures for attractiveness. After doing distracting math problems, participants saw the pictures again, but with information about the person's personality. When participants learned that a person had positive personality characteristics (e.g., smart, funny, kind), that person was seen as more physically attractive.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Personality goes a long way: The malleability of opposite-sex physical attractiveness |first=Gary |last=Lewandowski |first2=Art |last2=Aron |first3=Julie |last3=Gee | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=14 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=571\u2013585 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.2007.00172.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9217 }}</ref> Conversely, a person with negative personality characteristics (e.g., materialistic, rude, untrustworthy) was seen as less physically attractive.

A survey conducted by [[London Guildhall University]] of 11,000 people showed that those who subjectively describe themselves as physically attractive earn more income than others who would describe themselves as less attractive.<ref name = \"Lorenz_2005\" /> People who described themselves as less attractive earned, on average, 13% less than those who described themselves as more attractive, while the penalty for being overweight was around 5%. According to further research done on the correlation between looks and earnings in men, the punishment for unattractiveness is greater than the benefits of being attractive. However, in women the punishment is found to be equal to the benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/264698|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722122952/http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/264698|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=University of Toronto Libraries<!-- - Object not found!-->|work=utoronto.ca|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Another study suggests that more physically attractive people are significantly more likely on average to earn considerably higher wages.
