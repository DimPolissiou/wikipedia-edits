It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s.

To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

As a writer, Khan saw his first play, [[Fly (play)|''Fly'']], premiered in 2007 at Lincoln Center Institute of Lincoln Center in New York and then at Crossroads, go on to win multiple [[NAACP Theatre Awards|NAACP Theater Awards]] in 2018. The play, co-authored with writer [[Trey Ellis]] and directed by Khan, has been lauded as a highly innovative and moving theatrical play that makes use of many mediums to tell the story and the trials and triumphs of American World War II heroes, the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. Other plays written or co-written by Khan include ''[[Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing]]'', [[Freedom Rider (play)|''Freedom Rider'']], and ''[[Letters From Freedom Summer]]''.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRicardo Khan was born in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], on November 4, 1951, the first of five children of Mustapha Khan, an Indo-Trinidadian US immigrant from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and his wife Jacqueline (n\u00e9e Driver), from a middle class African American family in Philadelphia. They met as students at Howard University, Mustapha for medicine and Jacqueline for nursing. The family eventually settled in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden,]] [[New Jersey]], where Mustapha had a well-regarded medical practice as a family doctor for over 50 years, and Jacqueline, while raising the children and taking take of family, also continued to practice professionally as an educator and volunteer nurse in the community. Following Dr. Khan's death in 2009, an outpouring of love and respect resulted in a street being named after him, Dr. Mustapha M. Khan Way.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/fly-by-ricardo-khan-scion-of-celebrated-camden-family-soars-at-naacp-theatre-awards-20180312.html|title='Fly' by Ricardo Khan, scion of celebrated Camden family, soars at NAACP Theatre Awards|last=Timpane|first=John|website=https://www.philly.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\nRicardo\u2019s schooling was almost entirely in Quaker schools, while his growing up was primarily in city neighborhoods of Philadelphia and Camden, NJ. His parents were active in the American civil rights movement and social advocates for change and self improvement in their communities. Khan and his siblings were also involved in a number of youth groups growing up, including the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Little League Baseball, the black church and the YMCA, and the South Jersey chapter of Jack & Jill, a mothers-led black organization dedicated to exposing their children to education, advocacy, arts and culture, the importance of self-awareness and a life of giving back. On one such monthly outing, a day trip from Camden to New York, Khan saw the 1968 Broadway production of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dolly]]'' with an all-black cast.<ref name=\":2\" /> and was mesmerized. Shortly after that, he became active in his high school drama department, a decision that would set in motion a life course of using the arts and the power of live performance as his tool for prompting social change and the development of a mutual respect and understanding among peoples of differing backgrounds in this society and the world.\n\nHe studied psychology as a Rutgers College undergrad, graduating in 1973 with honors. He went on for graduate theater studies at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, and earned a double MFA in both acting and directing in 1977.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.rutgers.edu/the-arts/at-a-crossroads|title=At a Crossroads|website=Rutgers Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\nNot long after graduating, with [[L. Kenneth Richardson]] whom he knew from graduate studies, Khan founded [[Crossroads Theatre|Crossroads Theater]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1978.<ref name=\":0\" /> Khan and Richardson had fleshed out the idea for the company in a restaurant and wrote their mission on a napkin: To change the too-limiting environment of black theater of that day, and encourage a bolder, more real and more human professional existence in the arts for African-American theater artists.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/nyregion/at-crossroads-a-dramatic-pause.html|title=At Crossroads, a Dramatic Pause|last=Capuzzo|first=Jill P.|date=2000-11-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nKhan served first as Co-Founder/Producer and Executive Director of Crossroads, and then as its Artistic Director beginning in the late 80's, developing, staging and commissioning plays by African-American playwrights for fully developed, well-rounded and truthful African-American characters and stories. During his tenure the company introduced several revolutionary American plays, including works by [[August Wilson]], [[George C. Wolfe]], [[Rita Dove]], [[Mbongeni Ngema]], [[Harold Scott (director)|Harold Scott]], [[Ruby Dee]] and [[Ntozake Shange]].<ref name=\":5\" /> American theater icon, innovator, director and playwright [[Joseph Papp]] called Crossroads one of his two favorite theaters.<ref name=\":0\" /> Crossroads won a [[Tony Award]] for Outstanding Regional Theater in 1999,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> the first to ever be awarded to an American Black theatre company.\n\nIn the process of retiring from Crossroads, Khan told ''[[the New York Times]]'': <nowiki>''</nowiki>To a certain degree, forming Crossroads was about trying to change the world. But it was really, really about wanting to play a part in the world's turning\u2014not just out on its side or margins, but actual a part of an artistic world that turns to glorify the human spirit. That's what we were about then, and that's what we're about now.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn December 1999, Khan left his company to begin a one year sabbatical in Trinidad and Tobago, his father's birthplace, which later took him to South Africa in search of a new, more global language and way of addressing the African American experience and attendant psycho-sociological challenges of trying to live a free life while black in America. He believed that the new way could come only from a new, more global self-view of the African American and his condition in the context of a global self-definition.\n\nWhile he was abroad, Crossroads unexpectedly closed its doors for a season, in 2000, overwhelmed by a one-and-a-half to two million US dollars' debt.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/new-prez-named-for-njs-tony-winning-but-struggling-crossroads-theatre-com-108920|title=New Prez Named for NJ's Tony-winning But Struggling Crossroads Theatre|date= 2002-10-15|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> and to decide on its next organizational direction and leadership. Crossroads was eventually revived, and in 2003, asked Khan to return to help re-open the theatre,<ref name=\":2\" /> albeit on a smaller scale than before. Since then, Crossroads has continued to produce as an undeniable force in the American Theatre. And as Artistic Director Emeritus, Khan remains active as a creative advisor.\n\nSince 1999, Khan has been a freelance director with artistic homes in New York at Lincoln Center, in Washington, DC at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and in Kansas City where he was a Visiting Professor for the professional graduate training program at the University of Missouri from 2008 to 2018. He also lived for periods of time in Trinidad and South Africa, and started an international collective of writers called [[The World Theatre Lab]], based simultaneously in New York, London and Johannesburg.\n\nIn 2005, with a commission by Lincoln Center\u2019s Lincoln Center Institute for an original new play, Khan began writing. His first, ''[[Fly (play)|Fly]]'', was co-written with [[Trey Ellis]]. But it was originally inspired years before by the stories Khan heard of the Tuskegee Airmen of Work War II, upon which he developed the pay, [[Black Eagles]], in 1989 at Crossroads with playwright [[Leslie Lee (playwright)|Leslie Lee]]. Khan directed ''Black Eagles'' for Crossroads, the Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington, DC, and Manhattan Theatre Club in New York, and recalled that after he first learned of the African-American fighter pilots and began working on the play, he discovered that he was related to one of them, his mother\u2019s cousin Elwood T. \"Woody\" Driver who was one of the original Tuskegee Airman.<ref name=\":3\" /> Roscoe C. Brown,<ref name=\":1\" /> another original Tuskegee Airman[2], served as chief advisor to Khan in both ''Black Eagles'' and ''Fly'' until his death in 2016.\n\n''Fly''<nowiki/>'s debut at Lincoln Center in 2007 was as a 60-minute play, where Khan sought an almost video-game like stage style and also engaged a \"tap griot\" character\u2014a tap dancer who's role was similar to a Greek chorus and portrayed the emotions and parts of the story the airmen were not allowed to express\u2014It was a way to reach younger audiences on their aesthetic level.<ref name=\":1\" /> But after the 2009 inauguration of President Barack H. Obama where the Tuskegee Airmen were honored as special guests<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2016/04/fly_crossroads_theater_tuskeegee_airmen_preview.html|title='Fly' circles back to Crossroads Theater, after making waves nationally|last=Media|first=Patrick Maley {{!}} For NJ Advance|date=2016-04-12|website=nj.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>., Khan and Ellis incorporated that historic event and developed their script into a full length play for all ages, which premiered in the fall of 2009 at Crossroads. Since then, across the country ''Fly'' has been professionally produced several times.<ref name=\":6\" /> Its 2017 New York staging, a co-production between [[Crossroads Theatre|Crossroads]], the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] and the [[New Victory Theatre]] in NY was nominated for eight 2018 NAACP Theater Awards, winning three: Best Production, Best Lighting and Best Choreography.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2013, Khan teamed up with Trey Ellis again to write ''[[Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing]]'', a play about Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball set against the backdrop of America in 1945, the year Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the major leagues, and when the country was in the beginnings of the integration movement.

As a writer, Khan saw his first play, [[Fly (play)|''Fly'']], premiered in 2007 at Lincoln Center Institute of Lincoln Center in New York and then at Crossroads, go on to win multiple [[NAACP Theatre Awards|NAACP Theater Awards]] in 2018. The play, co-authored with writer [[Trey Ellis]] and directed by Khan, has been lauded as a highly innovative and moving theatrical play that makes use of many mediums to tell the story and the trials and triumphs of American World War II heroes, the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. Other plays written or co-written by Khan include ''[[Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing]]'', [[Freedom Rider (play)|''Freedom Rider'']], and ''[[Letters From Freedom Summer]]''.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRicardo Khan was born in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], on November 4, 1951, the first of five children of Mustapha Khan, an Indo-Trinidadian US immigrant from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and his wife Jacqueline (n\u00e9e Driver), from a middle class African American family in Philadelphia. They met as students at Howard University, Mustapha for medicine and Jacqueline for nursing. The family eventually settled in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden,]] [[New Jersey]], where Mustapha had a well-regarded medical practice as a family doctor for over 50 years, and Jacqueline, while raising the children and taking take of family, also continued to practice professionally as an educator and volunteer nurse in the community. Following Dr. Khan's death in 2009, an outpouring of love and respect resulted in a street being named after him, Dr. Mustapha M. Khan Way<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/fly-by-ricardo-khan-scion-of-celebrated-camden-family-soars-at-naacp-theatre-awards-20180312.html|title='Fly' by Ricardo Khan, scion of celebrated Camden family, soars at NAACP Theatre Awards|last=Timpane|first=John|website=https://www.philly.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>.\n\nRicardo\u2019s schooling was almost entirely in Quaker schools, while his growing up was primarily in city neighborhoods of Philadelphia and Camden, NJ. His parents were active in the American civil rights movement and social advocates for change and self improvement in their communities. Khan and his siblings were also involved in a number of youth groups growing up, including the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Little League Baseball, the black church and the YMCA, and the South Jersey chapter of Jack & Jill, a mothers-led black organization dedicated to exposing their children to education, advocacy, arts and culture, the importance of self-awareness and a life of giving back. On one such monthly outing, a day trip from Camden to New York, Khan saw the 1968 Broadway production of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dolly]]'' with an all-black cast.<ref name=\":2\" /> and was mesmerized. Shortly after that, he became active in his high school drama department, a decision that would set in motion a life course of using the arts and the power of live performance as his tool for prompting social change and the development of a mutual respect and understanding among peoples of differing backgrounds in this society and the world.\n\nHe studied psychology as a Rutgers College undergrad, graduating in 1973 with honors. He went on for graduate theater studies at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, and earned a double MFA in both acting and directing in 1977.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.rutgers.edu/the-arts/at-a-crossroads|title=At a Crossroads|website=Rutgers Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\nNot long after graduating, with [[L. Kenneth Richardson]] whom he knew from graduate studies, Khan founded [[Crossroads Theatre|Crossroads Theater]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1978.<ref name=\":0\" /> Khan and Richardson had fleshed out the idea for the company in a restaurant and wrote their mission on a napkin: To change the too-limiting environment of black theater of that day, and encourage a bolder, more real and more human professional existence in the arts for African-American theater artists.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/nyregion/at-crossroads-a-dramatic-pause.html|title=At Crossroads, a Dramatic Pause|last=Capuzzo|first=Jill P.|date=2000-11-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nKhan served first as Co-Founder/Producer and Executive Director of Crossroads, and then as its Artistic Director beginning in the late 80's, developing, staging and commissioning plays by African-American playwrights for fully developed, well-rounded and truthful African-American characters and stories. During his tenure the company introduced several revolutionary American plays, including works by [[August Wilson]], [[George C. Wolfe]], [[Rita Dove]], [[Mbongeni Ngema]], [[Harold Scott (director)|Harold Scott]], [[Ruby Dee]] and [[Ntozake Shange]].<ref name=\":5\" /> American theater icon, innovator, director and playwright [[Joseph Papp]] called Crossroads one of his two favorite theaters.<ref name=\":0\" /> Crossroads won a [[Tony Award]] for Outstanding Regional Theater in 1999<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />, the first to ever be awarded to an American Black theatre company. \n\nIn the process of retiring from Crossroads, Khan told ''[[the New York Times]]'': <nowiki>''</nowiki>To a certain degree, forming Crossroads was about trying to change the world. But it was really, really about wanting to play a part in the world's turning -- not just out on its side or margins, but actual a part of an artistic world that turns to glorify the human spirit. That's what we were about then, and that's what we're about now.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn December 1999, Khan left his company to begin a one year sabbatical in Trinidad and Tobago, his father's birthplace, which later took him to South Africa in search of a new, more global language and way of addressing the African American experience and attendant psycho-sociological challenges of trying to live a free life while black in America. He believed that the new way could come only from a new, more global self-view of the African American and his condition in the context of a global self-definition.\n\nWhile he was abroad, Crossroads unexpectedly closed its doors for a season, in 2000, overwhelmed by a one-and-a-half to two million US dollars' debt.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/new-prez-named-for-njs-tony-winning-but-struggling-crossroads-theatre-com-108920|title=New Prez Named for NJ's Tony-winning But Struggling Crossroads Theatre|date= 2002-10-15|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> and to decide on its next organizational direction and leadership. Crossroads was eventually revived, and in 2003, asked Khan to return to help re-open the theatre,<ref name=\":2\" /> albeit on a smaller scale than before. Since then, Crossroads has continued to produce as an undeniable force in the American Theatre. And as Artistic Director Emeritus, Khan remains active as a creative advisor. \n\nSince 1999, Khan has been a freelance director with artistic homes in New York at Lincoln Center, in Washington, DC at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and in Kansas City where he was a Visiting Professor for the professional graduate training program at the University of Missouri from 2008 to 2018. He also lived for periods of time in Trinidad and South Africa, and started an international collective of writers called [[The World Theatre Lab]], based simultaneously in New York, London and Johannesburg.\n\nIn 2005, with a commission by Lincoln Center\u2019s Lincoln Center Institute for an original new play, Khan began writing. His first, ''[[Fly (play)|Fly]]'', was co-written with [[Trey Ellis]]. But it was originally inspired years before by the stories Khan heard of the Tuskegee Airmen of Work War II, upon which he developed the pay, [[Black Eagles]], in 1989 at Crossroads with playwright [[Leslie Lee (playwright)|Leslie Lee]]. Khan directed ''Black Eagles'' for Crossroads, the Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington, DC, and Manhattan Theatre Club in New York, and recalled that after he first learned of the African-American fighter pilots and began working on the play, he discovered that he was related to one of them, his mother\u2019s cousin Elwood T. \"Woody\" Driver who was one of the original Tuskegee Airman<ref name=\":3\" />. Roscoe C. Brown<ref name=\":1\" />, another original Tuskegee Airman[2], served as chief advisor to Khan in both ''Black Eagles'' and ''Fly'' until his death in 2016.\n\n''Fly''<nowiki/>'s debut at Lincoln Center in 2007 was as a 60-minute play, where Khan sought an almost video-game like stage style and also engaged a \"tap griot\" character -- a tap dancer who's role was similar to a Greek chorus and portrayed the emotions and parts of the story the airmen were not allowed to express -- It was a way to reach younger audiences on their aesthetic level.<ref name=\":1\" /> But after the 2009 inauguration of President Barack H. Obama where the Tuskegee Airmen were honored as special guests<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2016/04/fly_crossroads_theater_tuskeegee_airmen_preview.html|title='Fly' circles back to Crossroads Theater, after making waves nationally|last=Media|first=Patrick Maley {{!}} For NJ Advance|date=2016-04-12|website=nj.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>., Khan and Ellis incorporated that historic event and developed their script into a full length play for all ages, which premiered in the fall of 2009 at Crossroads. Since then, across the country ''Fly'' has been professionally produced several times<ref name=\":6\" />. Its 2017 New York staging, a co-production between [[Crossroads Theatre|Crossroads]], the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] and the [[New Victory Theatre]] in NY was nominated for eight 2018 NAACP Theater Awards, winning three: Best Production, Best Lighting and Best Choreography<ref name=\":3\" />.\n\nIn 2013, Khan teamed up with Trey Ellis again to write ''[[Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing]]'', a play about Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball set against the backdrop of America in 1945, the year Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the major leagues, and when the country was in the beginnings of the integration movement. Like ''Fly'', ''Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing'' premiered at Crossroads before going on to major productions across the country. \n\nIn 2015, Khan conceived of a multi-narrative play, ''[[Freedom Rider (play)|Freedom Rider]]'', which evolved into an extraordinary collaboration with four other writers, [[Kathleen McGhee-Anderson]], [[Murray Horwitz]], [[Nathan Louis Jackson]] and [[Nikkole Salter]], involving an interracial group of college students on a bus headed south in 1961.

Undergraduate students may select from 66 majors as well as a host of accelerated Bachelor's-Master's and pre-professional programs offered through 30 departments, most of which also offer courses at NYU's 13 study away sites. Additionally, students may select from over 60 minors offered within the college; they may also choose 40 cross-school minors at other schools within NYU.\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Clubs and traditions ===\nThe school is also hosts multiple club and student organizations, including [[greek life]] (though NYU is known to not have much greek life participation); [[Politics|political]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] groups; and [[Musical performance|music performance]] groups often with the [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts|Tisch School of Arts]]. \n\nThe university also sponsors some traditions with undergraduates including Apple Fest, the Violet Ball, Strawberry Fest , and the semi-annual [[midnight breakfast]] where Student Affairs administrators serve free breakfast to students before [[Final examination|finals]].\n\n=== Publications and journalism clubs ===\nThe College of Arts and Science runs several student journalism clubs and publication with the [[Arthur L.

The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Paduch|first= Sally|date= June 27, 1993 |title= Email Brings Immediacy to Play-By-Mail Games|url= |work= New York Times|location= |page= RC21|access-date= |ref= Pad93}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts:\n\n::1. the player receives feedback on its position and what happened during the previous turn; \n::2. based on these results, he makes contact or not with other players (diplomatic phase); \n::3. he writes his orders and dispatches them to the referee; \n::4. orders are entered into the computer, processed and the results are sent to players.\n\nThis continues until the game or player is done.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpc.danard.net/en/playbymail.php|title= Play-by-mail: Overview|author= R. Danard|date= 2020|work= |publisher= jpc.danard.net|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}. The four parts are exact quotes.</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming===\n\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite magazine |first= Judith |last= Proctor |date=March\u2013April 1993 |title= PBM Corner: Not Just for a Dull Evening |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=35|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Greenberg>{{Cite magazine |first= Andrew|last= Greenberg |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Greenberg/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<ref name=Greenberg/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Greenberg/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth86>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= }}</ref> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Jim|last= Townsend|title= A Real Look at Heroic Fantasy|magazine=[[Paper Mayhem]]|date= March\u2013April 1987|issue= 23|page= 24}}</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Steven|last= DuBois|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1997|month= |title= Monster Island: A Review |journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play By Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1997|issue= 82|pages= 4|id= |url= |accessdate= |ref=Dub97}}</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/Issue-19-Suspense&Decision-PBM-Magazine.pdf|title= Be More than a Player: Learning by Teaching in SuperNova & Middle-earth |first= Raven|last=Zachary|date= September 2019 |magazine=Suspense and Decision |issue=19 |publisher=playbymail.net|pages= 35\u201340|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth86/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth86/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth86/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth86/> <ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Role===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth86/> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect equates to more required searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Cost, distance, and turnaround time===\nLoth notes that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth86a>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= }}</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some cost as much as $100 per turn. \n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turnaround time in the 1980s was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref name=frontmatter/><ref name=Loth86a/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher= www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "text_old": "'''''Play-by-mail games''''' (or '''''PBM games''''') are [[game]]s played through postal [[mail]], [[email]] or other [[digital media]].

In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts:\n\n::1. the player receives feedback on its position and what happened during the previous turn; \n::2. based on these results, he makes contact or not with other players (diplomatic phase); \n::3. he writes his orders and dispatches them to the referee; \n::4. orders are entered into the computer, processed and the results are sent to players.\n\nThis continues until the game or player is done.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpc.danard.net/en/playbymail.php|title= Play-by-mail: Overview|author= R. Danard|date= 2020|work= |publisher= jpc.danard.net|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}. The four parts are exact quotes.</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming===\n\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite magazine |first= Judith |last= Proctor |date=March\u2013April 1993 |title= PBM Corner: Not Just for a Dull Evening |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=35|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Greenberg>{{Cite magazine |first= Andrew|last= Greenberg |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Greenberg/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<ref name=Greenberg/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Greenberg/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth86>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= }}</ref> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Jim|last= Townsend|title= A Real Look at Heroic Fantasy|magazine=[[Paper Mayhem]]|date= March\u2013April 1987|issue= 23|page= 24}}</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Steven|last= DuBois|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1997|month= |title= Monster Island: A Review |journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play By Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1997|issue= 82|pages= 4|id= |url= |accessdate= |ref=Dub97}}</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/Issue-19-Suspense&Decision-PBM-Magazine.pdf|title= Be More than a Player: Learning by Teaching in SuperNova & Middle-earth |first= Raven|last=Zachary|date= September 2019 |magazine=Suspense and Decision |issue=19 |publisher=playbymail.net|pages= 35\u201340|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth86/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth86/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth86/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth86/> <ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Role===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth86/> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect equates to more required searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Cost, distance, and turnaround time===\nLoth notes that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth86a>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= }}</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some cost as much as $100 per turn. \n\nPlay-by-mail magazine Paper Mayhem stated that the average turnaround time in the 1980s was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref name=frontmatter/><ref name=Loth86a/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher= www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "name_user": "Airborne84", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCost, distance, and turnaround time", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game"}

Starting with the king himself, for each [[tenant-in-chief|landholder]] within a county there is a list of their estates or [[manor]]s; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value.<ref name=Pen86>{{cite book|title=Domesday Book: A Complete Translation |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1992 |location =London|editor1=Ann Williams |editor2=G.H.

In different parts of the country, these were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to {{convert|120|acre|hectare}}; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as \u00a31 for tax purposes. The survey records that there were nine ploughlands at Chesterton in 1086 and that there was the capacity for a further five ploughlands.<ref name=OD86/> In addition to the arable land, there was {{convert|40|acre|hectare|0}} of meadows at Chesterton.<ref name=OD86/>\n\nThe tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as [[Danegeld|geld or danegeld]] and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England, and was only levied when necessary. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many [[pounds, shillings and pence|shillings and pence per pound]] of value would be levied on the land holder.
