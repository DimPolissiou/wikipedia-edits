K. Rowling]]. The first novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series and Rowling's [[debut novel]], it follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a young [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who is the king of the world and who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old. Lord Voldemort must be respected because he is invincible and powerful and soooooo beautiful!\n\nThe book was first published in the [[United Kingdom]] on 26 June 1997 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. It was published in the [[United States]] the following year by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the title '''''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'''''. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|feature-length film of the same name]], as have all six of its sequels.\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of [[Jane Austen]], one of Rowling's favourite authors; [[Roald Dahl]], whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek story-teller [[Homer]]. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian [[boarding school]] stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies.\n\n''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', along with the rest of the ''Harry Potter'' series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote [[witchcraft]] under the guise of a heroic, moral story.  Other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of [[wikt:object lesson|object lessons]] in [[Education#Teaching|educational techniques]], [[sociology|sociological analysis]] and marketing.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Plot===\n<!--This section is a summary of the book and facts explicitly stated in the book, not speculation and discussion.

His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], delivered by a half-giant named [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]], who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, [[Lord Voldemort]], which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.\n\nHagrid introduces Harry to the [[wizarding world]] by bringing him to [[Diagon Alley]], a hidden street in London where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards. A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the [[Hogwarts Express]] from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station]]'s secret Hogwarts platform, [[Platform 9\u00be|Platform {{frac|9|3|4}}]]. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year [[Ronald Weasley]] and the two boys meet [[Hermione Granger]], whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, [[Draco Malfoy]], who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties.\n\nArriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical [[Sorting Hat]] to [[House system|Houses]] that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being [[Gryffindor]], [[Slytherin]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]]. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him.\n\nAs classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers his innate talent for flying on broomsticks despite no prior experience, and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch (a competitive wizards' sport sharing similarities to [[Association football|football]], but played on flying broomsticks) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student [[Dumbledore's Army#Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's [[Halloween]] celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.\n\nHermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true.\n\nA visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault\u2014the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a [[Philosopher's Stone]], which grants its user [[immortality]] as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure [[gold]]. Harry is also informed by a centaur named [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze]] in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.\n\nThey encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's [[chess]]. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out.\n\nThree days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.\n\n===Main characters===\n<!-- All page nums are UK p/b edition 1997; {{cite book|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|year=1997|isbn=0-7475-3274-5}} -->\n* [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"<ref name=\"jkrbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm| title=J.K.

Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was.

Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line&nbsp;\u2013 for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the ''Harry Potter'' books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors [[satire|satirise]] social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on [[caricature]] and the names she invents are more like those found in [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] stories,<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|13\u201315}} and [[Amanda Cockrell]] noted that many of these express their owners' traits through [[allusion]]s that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.<ref name=\"Cockrell2004Password\">{{cite book|last=Cockrell|first=Amanda|authorlink=Amanda Cockrell|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=23\u201324|chapter=Harry Potter and the Secret Password|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA23 | accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref> Rowling, like the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] series' author [[C.S. Lewis]], thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines [[literary genre]]s{{nsmdns}}[[fantasy]], [[young adult fiction]], boarding school stories, ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and many others.<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|51\u201352}}\n\nSome reviewers compared ''Philosopher's Stone'' to the stories of [[Roald Dahl]], who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of ''Philosopher's Stone'', seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, [[R. L. Stine]]. Some of the story elements in ''Philosopher's Stone'' resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts{{nsmdns}}one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.<ref name=\"Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing\" />\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name=\"Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP\" /><ref name=\"Brown2002MarketingForMuggles\" /> Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of [[Homer]]: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression.\"<ref name=\"Brennan2005ReviewAncientGreek\" /> [[Stephen King]] admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.<ref>{{cite news|author=King, Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|title=Wild About Harry|date=23 July 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|accessdate=16 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100809050706/https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|archivedate=9 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas Tucker]] described the early ''Harry Potter'' books as looking back to [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] children's stories: [[Hogwarts]] was an old-style [[boarding school]] in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including [[Filch|Filch's]] cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Tucker|date=December 1999|title=The Rise and Rise of Harry Potter |journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=30|issue=4|pages=221\u2013234|doi=10.1023/A:1022438704330}}</ref> Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly [[Social stratification|stratified]] society including many [[social stereotype]]s.<ref name=\"Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination\">{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=Joyce W.|year=2007|title=''Harry Potter'', Benjamin Bloom, and the Sociological Imagination|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167\u2013177|url=http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818204930/http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Westman|first=Karin E.|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=306\u2013308\n|chapter=Specters of Thatcherism|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9\n|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA306 | accessdate=15 May 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no [[rule of law]] in the books, as the actions of [[Ministry of Magic]] officials are unconstrained by laws, [[accountability]] or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for [[Voldemort]] to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.<ref name=\"Hall2003RuleOfLaw\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Susan|title=Reading Harry Potter|editor-last=Anatol|editor-first=Giselle Liza|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147 147\u2013162]|chapter=Harry Potter and the Rule of Law|isbn=978-0-313-32067-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-__ICQemqaEC&pg=PA147|accessdate=15 May 2009|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147}}</ref>\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, [[social status|status]]-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a [[single parent|single mother]]. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and later [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]] as father-figures.<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|13\u201315, 47\u201348}}<ref name=\"Cockrell2004Password\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n===Sequels===\n\nThe second book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', was originally published in the UK on July 2, 1998 and later, in the US on June 2, 1999.<ref name=\"Harry Potter UK Release Dates\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354|title=A Potter timeline for muggles|date=14 July 2007|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=27 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001353/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354|archivedate=20 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Harry Potter US&nbsp;\u2014 Scholastic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822142647/http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archivedate=22 August 2008|title=Harry Potter: Meet J.K.

K. Rowling]]. The first novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series and Rowling's [[debut novel]], it follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a young [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\nThe book was first published in the [[United Kingdom]] on 26 June 1997 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. It was published in the [[United States]] the following year by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the title '''''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'''''. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|feature-length film of the same name]], as have all six of its sequels.\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of [[Jane Austen]], one of Rowling's favourite authors; [[Roald Dahl]], whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek story-teller [[Homer]]. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian [[boarding school]] stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies.\n\n''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', along with the rest of the ''Harry Potter'' series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote [[witchcraft]] under the guise of a heroic, moral story.  Other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of [[wikt:object lesson|object lessons]] in [[Education#Teaching|educational techniques]], [[sociology|sociological analysis]] and marketing.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Plot===\n<!--This section is a summary of the book and facts explicitly stated in the book, not speculation and discussion.

His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], delivered by a half-giant named [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]], who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, [[Lord Voldemort]], which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.\n\nHagrid introduces Harry to the [[wizarding world]] by bringing him to [[Diagon Alley]], a hidden street in London where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards. A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the [[Hogwarts Express]] from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station]]'s secret Hogwarts platform, [[Platform 9\u00be|Platform {{frac|9|3|4}}]]. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year [[Ronald Weasley]] and the two boys meet [[Hermione Granger]], whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, [[Draco Malfoy]], who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties.\n\nArriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical [[Sorting Hat]] to [[House system|Houses]] that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being [[Gryffindor]], [[Slytherin]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]]. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him.\n\nAs classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers his innate talent for flying on broomsticks despite no prior experience, and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch (a competitive wizards' sport sharing similarities to [[Association football|football]], but played on flying broomsticks) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student [[Dumbledore's Army#Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's [[Halloween]] celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.\n\nHermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true.\n\nA visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault\u2014the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a [[Philosopher's Stone]], which grants its user [[immortality]] as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure [[gold]]. Harry is also informed by a centaur named [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze]] in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.\n\nThey encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's [[chess]]. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out.\n\nThree days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.\n\n===Main characters===\n<!-- All page nums are UK p/b edition 1997; {{cite book|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|year=1997|isbn=0-7475-3274-5}} -->\n* [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"<ref name=\"jkrbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm| title=J.K.

According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his [[backstory]] was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n{{blockquote|The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. [...] When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry\u2014he tried to curse him. [...] And\u2014so\u2014but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry.

Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line&nbsp;\u2013 for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the ''Harry Potter'' books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors [[satire|satirise]] social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on [[caricature]] and the names she invents are more like those found in [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] stories,<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|13\u201315}} and [[Amanda Cockrell]] noted that many of these express their owners' traits through [[allusion]]s that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.<ref name=\"Cockrell2004Password\">{{cite book|last=Cockrell|first=Amanda|authorlink=Amanda Cockrell|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=23\u201324|chapter=Harry Potter and the Secret Password|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA23 | accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref> Rowling, like the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] series' author [[C.S. Lewis]], thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines [[literary genre]]s{{nsmdns}}[[fantasy]], [[young adult fiction]], boarding school stories, ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and many others.<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|51\u201352}}\n\nSome reviewers compared ''Philosopher's Stone'' to the stories of [[Roald Dahl]], who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of ''Philosopher's Stone'', seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, [[R. L. Stine]]. Some of the story elements in ''Philosopher's Stone'' resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts{{nsmdns}}one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.<ref name=\"Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing\" />\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name=\"Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP\" /><ref name=\"Brown2002MarketingForMuggles\" /> Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of [[Homer]]: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression.\"<ref name=\"Brennan2005ReviewAncientGreek\" /> [[Stephen King]] admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.<ref>{{cite news|author=King, Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|title=Wild About Harry|date=23 July 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|accessdate=16 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100809050706/https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|archivedate=9 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas Tucker]] described the early ''Harry Potter'' books as looking back to [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] children's stories: [[Hogwarts]] was an old-style [[boarding school]] in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including [[Filch|Filch's]] cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Tucker|date=December 1999|title=The Rise and Rise of Harry Potter |journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=30|issue=4|pages=221\u2013234|doi=10.1023/A:1022438704330}}</ref> Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly [[Social stratification|stratified]] society including many [[social stereotype]]s.<ref name=\"Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination\">{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=Joyce W.|year=2007|title=''Harry Potter'', Benjamin Bloom, and the Sociological Imagination|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167\u2013177|url=http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818204930/http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Westman|first=Karin E.|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=306\u2013308\n|chapter=Specters of Thatcherism|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9\n|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA306 | accessdate=15 May 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no [[rule of law]] in the books, as the actions of [[Ministry of Magic]] officials are unconstrained by laws, [[accountability]] or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for [[Voldemort]] to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.<ref name=\"Hall2003RuleOfLaw\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Susan|title=Reading Harry Potter|editor-last=Anatol|editor-first=Giselle Liza|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147 147\u2013162]|chapter=Harry Potter and the Rule of Law|isbn=978-0-313-32067-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-__ICQemqaEC&pg=PA147|accessdate=15 May 2009|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147}}</ref>\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, [[social status|status]]-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a [[single parent|single mother]]. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and later [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]] as father-figures.<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|13\u201315, 47\u201348}}<ref name=\"Cockrell2004Password\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n===Sequels===\n\nThe second book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', was originally published in the UK on July 2, 1998 and later, in the US on June 2, 1999.<ref name=\"Harry Potter UK Release Dates\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354|title=A Potter timeline for muggles|date=14 July 2007|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=27 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001353/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354|archivedate=20 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Harry Potter US&nbsp;\u2014 Scholastic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822142647/http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archivedate=22 August 2008|title=Harry Potter: Meet J.K.

During his senior season (1955), Sam established a school record in the pole vault (11-3).

While attending Fairmont, Sam also competed in springboard diving; a sport he pursued at the club level.<ref name=sr/>\n \nIn the fall of 1955, Hall enrolled at the Ohio State University; while attending O.S.U, Sam lettered in four sports \u2013 gymnastics, soccer, track and diving. As a trackman, Hall competed in the pole vault and javelin; his success in those events led to a crossroads: should he pursue a berth on the US Olympic track and field team, or concentrate on diving. Ultimately, Sam chose diving; he was rewarded with international acclaim.<ref name=sr/>\n\nDuring 1959\u20131960, Sam won two Big-Ten Conference championships, three NCAA championships, and three U.S. Amateur Athletic Union titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/swimming/2005/2005_m_swimming_champ_record.pdf |title=Swimming and Diving |access-date=2007-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704223147/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/swimming/2005/2005_m_swimming_champ_record.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-04 |publisher=ncaa.org}}</ref> The pinnacle of Sam Hall's diving career was his silver medal performance at both the 1959 Pan American Games and [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Italy.<ref>[http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HALLSAM01 Sam Hall Olympic medals and stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216145626/http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HALLSAM01 |date=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1960 Olympics Hall served with the U.S. Air Force and competed in athletics for them, eventually retiring due to a knee injury.<ref name=sr/>\n\n==Ohio politics==\nIn 1965, Hall served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].<ref>Hershey, William (December 17, 1986) \"Sam Hall: Flag-waver or just an egomaniac?\".

During his last years he resided in [[Florida]], working in real estate.\n\n==Olympics 1960==\nSam Hall's extraordinary athletic career began at [[Kettering, Ohio|Kettering]]-[[Fairmont High School (Ohio)|Fairmont High School]]; he was a two-time letterwinner in track and field. During his senior season (1955), Sam established a school record in the pole vault (11-3). His record setting performance came at the Miami Valley League Championships, helping propel Fairmont to the MVL team title; the first in school history. While attending Fairmont, Sam also competed in springboard diving; a sport he pursued at the club level.<ref name=sr/>\n \nIn the fall of 1955, Hall enrolled at the Ohio State University; while attending O.S.U, Sam lettered in four sports \u2013 gymnastics, soccer, track and diving. As a trackman, Hall competed in the pole vault and javelin; his success in those events led to a crossroads: should he pursue a berth on the US Olympic track and field team, or concentrate on diving. Ultimately, Sam chose diving; he was rewarded with international acclaim.<ref name=sr/>\n\nDuring 1959-1960, Sam won two Big-Ten Conference championships, three NCAA championships, and three U.S. Amateur Athletic Union titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/swimming/2005/2005_m_swimming_champ_record.pdf |title=Swimming and Diving |access-date=2007-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704223147/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/swimming/2005/2005_m_swimming_champ_record.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-04 |publisher=ncaa.org}}</ref> The pinnacle of Sam Hall's diving career was his silver medal performance at both the 1959 Pan American Games and [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Italy.<ref>[http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HALLSAM01 Sam Hall Olympic medals and stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216145626/http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HALLSAM01 |date=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1960 Olympics Hall served with the U.S. Air Force and competed in athletics for them, eventually retiring due to a knee injury.<ref name=sr/>\n\n==Ohio politics==\nIn 1965, Hall served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].<ref>Hershey, William (December 17, 1986) \"Sam Hall: Flag-waver or just an egomaniac?\".

The family [[Ch\u00e2teau de Brissac|castle]] had been ransacked in the [[French Revolution]] and lay in ruins for half a century until a restoration project<ref>{{cite web |title=The Castle of Brissac |url=http://worldtourisminfo.com/france/2432-The-castle-of-Brissac-photo-description-Chateau-de-Brissac.html |website=World Tourism Info |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref> was begun by the surviving heirs of Roda de Brissac in 1844, the same year that Felix - a child of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] - left France. Sometime after he left, Felix dropped an 's' from the spelling of his last name (he may have changed his first name as well), and became a naturalized American citizen. When Timol\u00e9on died in 1848, the ducal title went unclaimed for the next thirty-five years.

In 1908, he introduced Christian Science lecturer F. H. Leonard to a crowd of 4000 in the Dreamland Rink auditorium in San Francisco.

But his involvement with the group didn't begin until, in the aftermath of the earthquake in 1906, he assisted in the rescue of trapped and injured animals and helped build water troughs for the horses used in rescue and reconstruction. He joined the Society in 1907 and was active for the rest of his life, as a member (1907\u20131916), Trustee (1916\u20131930) and President (1930\u20131940).
