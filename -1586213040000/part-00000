It will host the next-generation [[neutrino astronomy|neutrino telescope]] in the form of a water [[Cherenkov detector]] with an instrumented volume of several cubic kilometres distributed over three locations in the Mediterranean: KM3NeT-Fr (off [[Toulon]], France), KM3NeT-It (off [[Portopalo di Capo Passero]], Sicily, Italy) and KM3NeT-Gr (off [[Pylos]], Peloponnese, Greece). The KM3NeT project continues work done under the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] (telescope built off coast of France), [[Neutrino Mediterranean Observatory|NEMO]] (planned telescope off coast of Italy) and [[NESTOR Project|NESTOR]] (planned telescope off coast of Greece) neutrino telescope projects. \n\nKM3NeT will search for [[neutrino]]s from distant astrophysical sources like [[supernova remnant]]s, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[supernova]]e or colliding stars and will be a powerful tool in the search for [[dark matter]] in the universe. Its prime objective is to detect neutrinos from sources in our galaxy. Arrays of thousands of optical sensor modules will detect the faint light in the deep sea from charged particles originating from collisions of the neutrinos and the water or rock in the vicinity of the detector. The research infrastructure will also house instrumentation for other sciences like [[marine biology]], [[oceanography]] and [[geophysics]] for long-term and on-line monitoring of the deep-sea environment and the sea bottom at depth of several kilometres.\n\nOnce fully completed, the KM3NeT research infrastructure will consists of several large subdetectors. At first, two of these  - together forming the ARCA detector - will indeed form a telescope searching for distant neutrino-sources. Another subdetector  - baptised ORCA - will be optimised to measure the properties of the neutrino itself. In that sense, ORCA is a neutrino particle physics detector.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:KM3NeT DOM in the lab.jpg|thumb|KM3NeT Digital Optical Module (DOM) in the laboratory]]\n\nIn the future and pending funding, the full neutrino telescope will contain on the order of 12000 pressure-resistant glass spheres attached to about 600 strings. In the current phase of construction, the telescope will comprise 345 strings, 230 in the ARCA detector and 115 in the ORCA detector. The strings hold 18 sensor spheres each, anchored to the sea floor and supported by floats.  Each sphere, called a \"digital optical module\" (DOM), is about {{convert|17|in|cm}} in diameter, contains 31 {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} [[photomultiplier]] tubes with supporting electronics, and is connected to shore via a high-bandwidth optical network. Together, the ARCA and ORCA detector contain 6210 DOMs.\n\nAt the shore of each KM3NeT installation site, a farm of computers will perform the first data filter in the search for the signal of cosmic neutrinos, prior to streaming the data to a central KM3NeT data centre for storage and further analysis by the KM3NeT scientists.\n\nThe KM3NeT-It site, at a depth of 3400&nbsp;m, hosts the ARCA (''Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss'') detector, with more widely spaced DOMs optimised for detecting high-energy cosmic neutrinos in the TeV\u2013PeV range.

In 2012, the first phase of the implementation of the KM3NeT research facility has started with the construction of the seabed infrastructure at the KM3NeT-Fr and KM3NeT-It sites. A prototype KM3NeT Digital Optical Module (KM3NeT-DOM) has been taking data successfully for more than a year as part of the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] telescope. The KM3NeT-Fr installation site close to the ANTARES telescope is being prepared for the installation in 2019 of the first strings for the ORCA detector for neutrino particle physics. At the KM3NET-It site the first prototype KM3NeT-string successfully took data for about a year. In 2016 and in 2017, the first full strings of the ARCA detector were installed. In 2018, the seabed cable network was shut down. Early 2019, a temporary fix revived the network and the first string. The cable network at the site is being redesigned for the installation of the two subdetectors of 115 string each for ARCA.  In February 2020, the first phase of the ORCA detector was completed with the installation of the sixth string. Together, ARCA and ORCA form the second phase of construction of KM3NeT.\n\n== Relation to other neutrino telescopes ==\nFor the design of the neutrino detector, KM3NeT builds on the experience of three pilot projects in the Mediterranean Sea: the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] detector, the [[Neutrino Mediterranean Observatory]] (NEMO) project and the [[NESTOR Project]]. The NEMO and NESTOR projects both did research and development work for a neutrino telescope, but said telescopes were never built (apart from some small prototypes). ANTARES telescope was completed on 30 May 2008, and is the largest neutrino telescope in the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, at Antarctica, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] is already operational. Together, IceCube and KM3NeT will view the full sky and form a global neutrino observatory.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:KM3NeT DOM-electronics.jpg|Electronics to read out the photomultiplier tubes and calibration instrumentation inside the KM3NeT DOM\nFile:KM3NeT LOM.jpg|The KM3NeT LOM \u2013 the launching vehicle of Optical Modules \u2013 being loaded onto the RV Pelagia deployment vessel.

The murders were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare, who sold the corpses to [[Robert Knox]] for [[dissection]] at his [[anatomy]] lectures.\n\nEdinburgh was a leading European centre of anatomical study in the early 19th century, in a time when the demand for [[cadaver]]s led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, [[suicide]] victims, or from [[wikt:foundling|foundlings]] and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in [[body snatching]] by what were known as \"resurrection men\". Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed\u2014such as the use of [[mortsafe]]s\u2014exacerbated the shortage. \n\nWhen a [[lodging|lodger]] in Hare's house died, he turned to his friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of \u00a37 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Burke and Hare's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and contacted the police.\n\nA forensic examination of Docherty's body indicated she had probably been suffocated, but this could not be proven. Although the police suspected Burke and Hare of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting [[legal immunity|immunity]] from prosecution if he [[Turn state's evidence|turned king's evidence]]. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. \n\nAt the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. The case against his wife was found [[not proven]]\u2014a Scottish legal [[verdict]] to [[acquittal|acquit]] an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was [[hanged]] shortly afterwards; his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Edinburgh Medical School]] where, as at<!-- PLEASE do not change to \"as of\": \"as at\" is correct in BrEng --> 2020, it remains.\n\nThe murders raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical research and contributed to the passing of the [[Anatomy Act 1832]]. The events have made appearances in literature, and been portrayed on screen, either in heavily fictionalised accounts or as the inspiration for fictional works.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Anatomy in 19th-century Edinburgh===\n{{Main|History of anatomy in the 19th century}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = Two techniques to deter grave robbers\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Watchtower, Dalkeith Cemetery.jpg\n| width1    = 170\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Graveyard watchtower, built in [[Dalkeith]] in 1827\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Mortsafe in Greyfriars Kirkyard.jpg\n| width2    = 182\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Mortsafe]] in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\n}}\n\nIn the early 19th century Edinburgh had several pioneering [[anatomy]] teachers, including [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro]], his son who was [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|also called Alexander]], [[John Bell (surgeon)|John Bell]], [[John Goodsir]] and [[Robert Knox]], all of whom developed the subject into a modern science.<ref name=\"BMJ: Pioneers\" /> Because of their efforts, Edinburgh became one of the leading European centres of anatomical study, alongside [[Leiden]] in the Netherlands and the Italian city of [[Padua]].{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=14}} The teaching of anatomy\u2014crucial in the study of surgery\u2014required a sufficient supply of [[cadaver]]s, the demand for which increased as the science developed.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=3}} Scottish law determined that suitable corpses on which to undertake the dissections were those who died in prison, [[suicide]] victims, and the bodies of [[wikt:foundling|foundlings]] and orphans.<ref name=\"Goodman: BMJ\" /> With the rise in prestige and popularity of medical training in Edinburgh, the legal supply of corpses failed to keep pace with the demand; students, lecturers and grave robbers\u2014also known as [[Body snatching|resurrection men]]\u2014began an illicit trade in exhumed cadavers.{{sfn|Richardson|1987|p=54}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=17}}\n\nThe situation was confused by the legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was the [[Grave robbery|taking of property from the deceased]]. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=97}} The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was \u00a38 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker [[human decomposition|decomposition]], and \u00a310 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=49}}\n\nBy the 1820s the residents of Edinburgh had taken to the streets to protest at the increase in grave robbing.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=229}} To avoid corpses being disinterred, bereaved families used several techniques in order to deter the thieves: guards were hired to watch the graves, and watchtowers were built in several cemeteries; some families hired a large stone slab that could be placed over a grave for a short period\u2014until the body had begun to decay past the point of being useful for an anatomist. Other families used a [[mortsafe]], an iron cage that surrounded the coffin.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=21\u201322}} The high levels of vigilance from the public, and the techniques used to deter the grave robbers, led to what the historian Ruth Richardson describes as \"a growing atmosphere of crisis\" among anatomists because of the shortage of corpses.{{sfn|Richardson|1987|p=101}} The historian Tim Marshall considers the situation meant \"Burke and Hare took graverobbing to its logical conclusion: instead of digging up the dead, they accepted lucrative incentives to destroy the living\".{{sfn|Marshall|1995|p=4}}\n\n===Dr Robert Knox===\n[[File:Dr. Robert Knox.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Knox|Dr Robert Knox]]]]\nKnox was an anatomist who had qualified as a doctor in 1814. After contracting [[smallpox]] as a child, he was blind in one eye and badly disfigured.{{sfn|Taylor|2004}} He undertook service as an army physician at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, followed by a posting in England and then, during the [[Xhosa Wars#Fifth War (1818\u201319)|Cape Frontier War]] (1819), in southern Africa. He eventually settled in his home town of Edinburgh in 1820. In 1825 he became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], where he lectured on anatomy. He undertook dissections twice a day, and his advertising promised \"a full demonstration on fresh anatomical subjects\" as part of every course of lectures he delivered;{{sfn|Bates|2010|p=61}} he stated that his lessons drew over 400 pupils.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=275}} Clare Taylor, his biographer in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', observes that he \"built up a formidable reputation as a teacher and lecturer and almost single-handedly raised the profile of the study of anatomy in Britain\".{{sfn|Taylor|2004}} Another biographer, Isobel Rae, considers that without Knox, the study of anatomy in Britain \"might not have progressed as it did\".{{sfn|Rae|1964|p=126}}\n\n===William Burke and William Hare===\n[[File:Facial reconstruction of William Burke.jpg|alt=Facial reconstruction of William Burke|thumb|upright|Facial reconstruction of William Burke|left]]\nWilliam Burke was born in 1792 in [[Urney, County Tyrone|Urney]], [[County Tyrone]], Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}} Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a comfortable upbringing, and both joined the [[British Army]] as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal militia until he met and married a woman from [[County Mayo]], where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]].{{sfn|Douglas|1973|p=30}} He settled in the small village of [[Maddiston]] near [[Falkirk]], and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife.{{sfn|Douglas|1973|p=31}} After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=262}} They became [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]], selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]], a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of \u00a31 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], Burke became a regular worshipper at [[Presbyterian]] religious meetings held in the [[Grassmarket]]; he was seldom seen without a bible.{{sfn|Douglas|1973|p=31}}\n\n[[File:Masks of Burke and Hare, Edinburgh Medical School.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Death mask]] of Burke ''(left)'' and life mask of Hare ''(right)'']]\nWilliam Hare was probably born in [[County Armagh]], [[County Londonderry]] or in [[Newry]]. His age and year of birth are unknown; when arrested in 1828 he gave his age as 21, but one source states that he was born between 1792 and 1804.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=66}} Information on his earlier life is scant, although it is possible that he worked in Ireland as an agricultural labourer before travelling to Britain. He worked on the Union Canal for seven years before moving to Edinburgh in the mid-1820s, where he worked as a coal man's assistant.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=66}} He lodged at Tanner's Close, in the house of a man named Logue and his wife, Margaret Laird, in the nearby [[West Port, Edinburgh|West Port]] area of the town. When Logue died in 1826, Hare may have married Margaret.{{efn|Gilliland observes that although there is no evidence that the couple had been formally married, they were considered as such under Scottish law.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}}} Based on contemporary accounts, Brian Bailey in his history of the murders describes Hare as \"illiterate and uncouth\u2014a lean, quarrelsome, violent and amoral character with the scars from old wounds about his head and brow\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=14}} Bailey describes Margaret, who was also an Irish immigrant, as a \"hard-featured and debauched [[wikt:virago|virago]]\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=33}}\n\nIn 1827 Burke and McDougal went to [[Penicuik]] in [[Midlothian]] to work on the harvest, where they met Hare. The men became friends; when Burke and McDougal returned to Edinburgh, they moved into Hare's Tanner's Close [[lodging house]], where the two couples soon acquired a reputation for hard drinking and boisterous behaviour.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}\n{{-}}\n\n==Events of November 1827 to November 1828==\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = The sites of all but one of the murders\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Burkes House from the Backcourt.jpg\n| width1    = 183\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = View of Burke's house from the rear\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Hares' lodging-house, Tanner's Close.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =Hare's lodging-house in Tanner's Close\n}}\n\nOn 29 November 1827 Donald, a lodger in Hare's house, died of [[edema|dropsy]] shortly before receiving a quarterly army pension while owing \u00a34 of back rent.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=22}} After Hare bemoaned his financial loss to Burke, the pair decided to sell Donald's body to one of the local anatomists.

The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the [[sheriff-substitute]], the [[procurator fiscal]] and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was in the form of an interview with the ''[[Edinburgh Courant]]'' that was published on 7 February 1829.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=233\u201334}} These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}}{{efn|The original copy of Hare's confession\u2014given on 1 December and accepted as the basis of his [[Turn state's evidence|turning king's evidence]]\u2014was subsequently lost, although the details were widely reported in the press of the time.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}}}} Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and [[Owen Dudley Edwards]], either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.{{efn|The modern sources that provide a chronological list of the murders are:\n* Brian Bailey, ''Burke and Hare: The Year of the Ghouls''; Bailey also tabulates the order from the two Burke confessions, three contemporary publications and his own;{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=70}}\n* Lisa Rosner, ''The Anatomy Murders'';{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=271\u201372}}\n* [[Owen Dudley Edwards]], ''Burke and Hare''.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=xx\u2013xxi}}}}\n\nMost of the sources agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a [[miller]] named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}} The historian Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=53\u201354}}{{efn|Rosner reflects that the pair were unlikely to change their ''modus operandi'' for the second murder, particularly for a less effective method of smothering a victim.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=54}}}} The novelist [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], who took a keen interest in the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that \"there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed\",{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}} as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with [[whisky]], Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=41\u201342}} They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid \u00a310.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=108}}{{efn|\u00a310 in 1828 equates to approximately \u00a3875 in 2016.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}} Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight on the victim stifled movement\u2014and thus the ability to make noise\u2014while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been \"practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics\".{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=54}}\n\nThe order of the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the sequence as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire,{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=56\u201357, 79}} while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=41\u201345}}{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=107\u201309}} The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with [[jaundice]] at Hare's lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same ''[[modus operandi]]'' they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=42\u201343}} Simpson was a pensioner who lived in the nearby village of [[Gilmerton]] and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828\u2014the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession\u2014she was invited into the Hares' house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a tea-chest and sold it to Knox.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=17}} They received \u00a310 for each body, and Burke's confession records of Simpson's body that \"Dr Knox approved of its being so fresh&nbsp;... but [he] did not ask any questions\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=42, 44}} In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave her enough whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman's mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another \u00a310.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=79\u201380}}\n\n[[File:Mary Paterson.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Paterson, killed by Burke while she was intoxicated]]\nBurke met two women in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in [[the Canongate]] area of Edinburgh.{{efn|The two women were described in contemporary accounts as prostitutes, but there is no evidence that this was true.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=116\u201317}}}} He bought the two women alcohol before inviting them back to his lodging for breakfast. The three left the tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother's house. After his brother left for work, Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougal\u2014during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eye\u2014Brown stated that she did not know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep.{{sfnm|Knight|2007|1pp=37\u201339|Bailey|2002|2pp=45\u201347|Lonsdale|1870|3pp=101\u201302}} That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a tea-chest, while McDougal kept Paterson's skirt and petticoats; they were paid \u00a38 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergusson\u2014one of Knox's assistants\u2014asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it \"from an old woman in the Canongate\". Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=41}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=104\u201305}} When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt some point in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke described as \"a stout old woman\", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, she fell asleep in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=133\u201334}} Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid \u00a38.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=126\u201327}} The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her\u2014Hare was not present in the house at the time; her body was sold to Knox for \u00a310.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=115\u201316}} Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a \"cinder gatherer\" who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave \u00a310 for the body.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=58}}{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=45}} Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further \u00a310 from Knox.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=58}}\n\nBurke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, \"an old woman and a dumb boy, her grandson\", as Burke later recalled in his confession.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=182}} While the boy sat by the fire in the kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method. Burke and Hare then picked up the boy and carried him to the same room where he was also killed.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=45}}{{efn|Some contemporary accounts state that Burke murdered the boy by putting him over his knee and breaking his back; both Rosner and Bailey consider this highly unlikely, and the latter describes it as \"a piece of sensational embroidery\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=58}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=148}}}} Burke later said that this was the murder that disturbed him the most, as he was haunted by his recollection of the boy's expression.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=19}} The tea-chest that was usually used by the couple to transport the bodies was found to be too small, so the bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to Surgeons' Square, where they fetched \u00a38 each.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=59}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=148\u201349}} According to Burke's confession, the barrel was loaded onto a cart which Hare's horse refused to pull further than the [[Grassmarket]]. Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner's Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|pp=267\u201328}}\n\nOn 24 June Burke and McDougal departed for Falkirk to visit the latter's father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for \u00a38. It led to an argument between the two men and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=48\u201349}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=149}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = The final two victims\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = James Wilson (Daft Jamie).jpg\n| width1    = 135\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =James Wilson, known locally as Daft Jamie\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2   = Mrs Docherty.jpg\n| width2    = 147\n| alt2   =\n| caption2  = Margaret Docherty\n}}\n\nThe breach between the two men did not last long. In late September or early October Hare was visiting Burke when Mrs Ostler (also given as Hostler), a washerwoman, came to the property to do the laundry.

He was [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]] and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=51}} Wilson [[Vagrancy (people)|lived on the streets]] and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like excess whisky\u2014he preferred [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]]\u2014he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=66\u201367}} When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=189\u201390}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=68}}\n\n[[File:Burke Murdering Margery Campbell.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Idealised etching of Burke murdering Margaret Docherty (also known as Margery Campbell) by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]]]]\nThe final victim, killed on 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty,{{efn|Margaret Docherty's name is also given as Margery, Mary or Madgy with the alternative surname Campbell.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=272}}{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=432}}}} a middle-aged Irish woman.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=56}} Burke lured her into the Broggan lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers\u2014Ann and James Gray\u2014were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00&nbsp;pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows at some point in the evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.{{sfn|MacGregor|1884|p=99}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=72\u201374}}\n\nThe next day the Grays returned, and Ann became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left alone in the house in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of \u00a310 a week; they refused.{{sfn|Leighton|1861|pp=198\u2013200}} While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery.{{efn|It was a Saturday and the dissecting rooms were closed, so the tea-chest containing the body was left in the cellar; Knox gave the men \u00a35, and told them he would examine it on Monday, when he would pay them the balance.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=76}}}} The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed.{{sfn|Ward|1998|p=15}} Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning.

Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=82}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nThe final prosecution witnesses were the two doctors, Black and Christison; both said they suspected foul play, but that there was no forensic evidence to support the suggestion of murder.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=82}} There were no witnesses called for the defence, although the pre-trial declarations by Burke and McDougal were read out in their place. The prosecution summed up their case, after which, at 3:00&nbsp;am, Burke's defence lawyer began his final statement, which lasted for two hours; McDougal's defence lawyer began his address to the jury on his client's behalf at 5:00&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=102\u201303}} Boyle then gave his summing up, directing the jury to accept the arguments of the prosecution.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=230}} The jury retired to consider its verdict at 8:30&nbsp;am on Christmas Day and returned fifty minutes later. It delivered a guilty verdict against Burke for the murder of Docherty; the same charge against McDougal they found [[not proven]].{{efn|On hearing the not proven verdict Burke turned to McDougal and said \"Nelly, you are out of the scrape\".{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=230}}}} As he passed the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] against Burke, Boyle told him:\n\n{{Quote|text=Your body should be publicly dissected and anatomized. And I trust, that if it is ever customary to preserve skeletons, yours will be preserved, in order that posterity may keep in remembrance your atrocious crimes.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|pp=257\u201358}}}}\n\n==Aftermath, including execution and dissection==\n[[File:Execution of Burke.jpg|thumb|Burke's execution; from a contemporary print]]\n\nMcDougal was released at the end of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby [[Fountainbridge]] for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=107\u201308}}{{efn|Some accounts of the escape state that she was disguised as a man for her escape from Fountainbridge, which Rosner considers \"picturesque though unlikely\".{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=232}}}} She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=232}} On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=113}}\n\nOn 16 January 1829 a petition on behalf of James Wilson's mother and sister, protesting against Hare's immunity and intended release from prison, was given lengthy consideration by the High Court of Justiciary and rejected by a vote of 4 to 2.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=237\u201338}} Margaret Hare was released on 19 January and travelled to Glasgow to find a passage back to Ireland. While waiting for a ship she was recognised and attacked by a mob. She was given shelter in a police station before being given a police escort onto a Belfast-bound vessel; no clear accounts exist of what became of her after she landed in Ireland.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=236\u201337}}\n\n[[File:William Burke's skeleton.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Burke's preserved skeleton]]\nBurke was [[hanged]] on the morning of 28 January 1829 in front of a crowd possibly as large as 25,000;{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=115\u201316}}{{efn|One contemporary source, A.

A minor riot ensued; calm was restored only after one of the university professors negotiated with the crowd that they would be allowed to pass through the theatre in batches of fifty, after the dissection. During the procedure, which lasted for two hours, Monro dipped his quill pen into Burke's blood and wrote \"This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head\".{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=244}}\n\nBurke's skeleton was given to the Anatomical Museum of the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Edinburgh Medical School]] where, as at 2018, it remains.<ref name=\"EU: skeleton\" /> His [[death mask]] and a book said to be [[Anthropodermic bibliopegy|bound with his tanned skin]] can be seen at [[Surgeons' Hall|Surgeons' Hall Museum]].<ref name=\"RCSEd: Pocketbook\" /><ref name=\"RCSEd: Mask\" />\n\nHare was released on 5 February 1829\u2014his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection\u2014and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to [[Dumfries]]. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, [[Erskine Douglas Sandford]], a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which took him to the town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 [[special constables]] arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|pp=75\u201376}} There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}{{efn|Several tales of Hare's fate exist. These include that he worked at a [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] pit, until he was recognised, upon which point his fellow-workers threw him into the pit, which turned him blind; he may have turned to begging on [[Oxford Street]], London. Other possibilities are that he went to Ireland or America and lived for 40 years after the murders.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}}}\n\n[[File:Cropping a Nox-i-ous Plant; Caricature of Robert Knox.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Knox, harvesting corpses]]\nKnox refused to make any public statements about his dealings with Burke and Hare.

He left Edinburgh in 1842 and lectured in Britain and mainland Europe. While working in London he fell foul of the regulations of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] and was debarred from lecturing; he was removed from the roll of fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1848.{{sfn|Taylor|2004}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=150\u201351}} From 1856 he worked as a pathological anatomist at the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Brompton Cancer Hospital]] and had a medical practice in Hackney until his death in 1862.{{sfn|Taylor|2004}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=268\u201369}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Legislation===\n[[File:Case made of Burke's skin.JPG|thumb|left|Calling-card case made of Burke's skin]]\nThe question of the supply of cadavers for scientific research had been promoted by the English [[philosopher]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] before the crimes of Burke and Hare took place.{{efn|In order to change public opinion on the matter, Bentham donated his body to be publicly dissected and his corpse to be preserved as an \"auto-icon\"; it has been on display in [[University College London]] since 1850.<ref name=\"UCL: Bentham\" /><ref name=\"RCS: Dissection\" />}} A [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|parliamentary select committee]] had drafted a \"Bill for preventing the unlawful disinterment of human bodies, and for regulating Schools of Anatomy\" in mid 1828\u2014six months before the murders were detected.

The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at [[King's College London]] led to an investigation of the [[London Burkers]], who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime.

period of about ten months in 1828 in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. They were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare, who sold the corpses to [[Robert Knox]] for  [[dissection]] at his [[anatomy]] lectures.\n\nEdinburgh was a leading European centre of anatomical study in the early 19th century, in a time when the demand for [[cadaver]]s led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, [[suicide]] victims, or from [[wikt:foundling|foundlings]] and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in [[body snatching]] by what were known as \"resurrection men\". Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed\u2014such as the use of [[mortsafe]]s\u2014exacerbated the shortage. When a lodger in Hare's house died, Hare turned to his friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of \u00a37 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Burke and Hare's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and contacted the police.\n\nA forensic examination of Docherty's body indicated she had probably been suffocated, but this could not be proven. Although the police suspected Burke and Hare of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting [[legal immunity|immunity]] from prosecution if he [[Turn state's evidence|turned king's evidence]]. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. The case against his wife was found [[not proven]]\u2014a Scottish legal [[verdict]] to [[acquittal|acquit]] an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was [[hanged]] shortly afterwards; his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Edinburgh Medical School]] where, as at<!-- PLEASE do not change to \"as of\": \"as at\" is correct in BrEng --> 2020, it remains.\n\nThe murders raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical research and contributed to the passing of the [[Anatomy Act 1832]]. The events have made appearances in literature, and been portrayed on screen, either in heavily fictionalised accounts or as the inspiration for fictional works.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Anatomy in 19th-century Edinburgh===\n{{Main|History of anatomy in the 19th century}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = Two techniques to deter grave robbers\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Watchtower, Dalkeith Cemetery.jpg\n| width1    = 170\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Graveyard watchtower, built in [[Dalkeith]] in 1827\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Mortsafe in Greyfriars Kirkyard.jpg\n| width2    = 182\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Mortsafe]] in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\n}}\n\nIn the early 19th century Edinburgh had several pioneering [[anatomy]] teachers, including [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro]], his son who was [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|also called Alexander]], [[John Bell (surgeon)|John Bell]], [[John Goodsir]] and [[Robert Knox]], all of whom developed the subject into a modern science.<ref name=\"BMJ: Pioneers\" /> Because of their efforts, Edinburgh became one of the leading European centres of anatomical study, alongside [[Leiden]] in the Netherlands and the Italian city of [[Padua]].{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=14}} The teaching of anatomy\u2014crucial in the study of surgery\u2014required a sufficient supply of [[cadaver]]s, the demand for which increased as the science developed.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=3}} Scottish law determined that suitable corpses on which to undertake the dissections were those who died in prison, [[suicide]] victims, and the bodies of [[wikt:foundling|foundlings]] and orphans.<ref name=\"Goodman: BMJ\" /> With the rise in prestige and popularity of medical training in Edinburgh, the legal supply of corpses failed to keep pace with the demand; students, lecturers and grave robbers\u2014also known as [[Body snatching|resurrection men]]\u2014began an illicit trade in exhumed cadavers.{{sfn|Richardson|1987|p=54}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=17}}\n\nThe situation was confused by the legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was the [[Grave robbery|taking of property from the deceased]]. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=97}} The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was \u00a38 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker [[human decomposition|decomposition]], and \u00a310 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=49}}\n\nBy the 1820s the residents of Edinburgh had taken to the streets to protest at the increase in grave robbing.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=229}} To avoid corpses being disinterred, bereaved families used several techniques in order to deter the thieves: guards were hired to watch the graves, and watchtowers were built in several cemeteries; some families hired a large stone slab that could be placed over a grave for a short period\u2014until the body had begun to decay past the point of being useful for an anatomist. Other families used a [[mortsafe]], an iron cage that surrounded the coffin.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=21\u201322}} The high levels of vigilance from the public, and the techniques used to deter the grave robbers, led to what the historian Ruth Richardson describes as \"a growing atmosphere of crisis\" among anatomists because of the shortage of corpses.{{sfn|Richardson|1987|p=101}} The historian Tim Marshall considers the situation meant \"Burke and Hare took graverobbing to its logical conclusion: instead of digging up the dead, they accepted lucrative incentives to destroy the living\".{{sfn|Marshall|1995|p=4}}\n\n===Dr Robert Knox===\n[[File:Dr. Robert Knox.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Knox|Dr Robert Knox]]]]\nKnox was an anatomist who had qualified as a doctor in 1814. After contracting [[smallpox]] as a child, he was blind in one eye and badly disfigured.{{sfn|Taylor|2004}} He undertook service as an army physician at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, followed by a posting in England and then, during the [[Xhosa Wars#Fifth War (1818\u201319)|Cape Frontier War]] (1819), in southern Africa. He eventually settled in his home town of Edinburgh in 1820. In 1825 he became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], where he lectured on anatomy. He undertook dissections twice a day, and his advertising promised \"a full demonstration on fresh anatomical subjects\" as part of every course of lectures he delivered;{{sfn|Bates|2010|p=61}} he stated that his lessons drew over 400 pupils.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=275}} Clare Taylor, his biographer in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', observes that he \"built up a formidable reputation as a teacher and lecturer and almost single-handedly raised the profile of the study of anatomy in Britain\".{{sfn|Taylor|2004}} Another biographer, Isobel Rae, considers that without Knox, the study of anatomy in Britain \"might not have progressed as it did\".{{sfn|Rae|1964|p=126}}\n\n===William Burke and William Hare===\n[[File:Facial reconstruction of William Burke.jpg|alt=Facial reconstruction of William Burke|thumb|upright|Facial reconstruction of William Burke|left]]\nWilliam Burke was born in 1792 in [[Urney, County Tyrone|Urney]], [[County Tyrone]], Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}} Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a comfortable upbringing, and both joined the [[British Army]] as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal militia until he met and married a woman from [[County Mayo]], where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]].{{sfn|Douglas|1973|p=30}} He settled in the small village of [[Maddiston]] near [[Falkirk]], and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife.{{sfn|Douglas|1973|p=31}} After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=262}} They became [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]], selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]], a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of \u00a31 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], Burke became a regular worshipper at [[Presbyterian]] religious meetings held in the [[Grassmarket]]; he was seldom seen without a bible.{{sfn|Douglas|1973|p=31}}\n\n[[File:Masks of Burke and Hare, Edinburgh Medical School.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Death mask]] of Burke ''(left)'' and life mask of Hare ''(right)'']]\nWilliam Hare was probably born in [[County Armagh]], [[County Londonderry]] or in [[Newry]]. His age and year of birth are unknown; when arrested in 1828 he gave his age as 21, but one source states that he was born between 1792 and 1804.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=66}} Information on his earlier life is scant, although it is possible that he worked in Ireland as an agricultural labourer before travelling to Britain. He worked on the Union Canal for seven years before moving to Edinburgh in the mid-1820s, where he worked as a coal man's assistant.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=66}} He lodged at Tanner's Close, in the house of a man named Logue and his wife, Margaret Laird, in the nearby [[West Port, Edinburgh|West Port]] area of the town. When Logue died in 1826, Hare may have married Margaret.{{efn|Gilliland observes that although there is no evidence that the couple had been formally married, they were considered as such under Scottish law.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}}} Based on contemporary accounts, Brian Bailey in his history of the murders describes Hare as \"illiterate and uncouth\u2014a lean, quarrelsome, violent and amoral character with the scars from old wounds about his head and brow\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=14}} Bailey describes Margaret, who was also an Irish immigrant, as a \"hard-featured and debauched [[wikt:virago|virago]]\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=33}}\n\nIn 1827 Burke and McDougal went to [[Penicuik]] in [[Midlothian]] to work on the harvest, where they met Hare. The men became friends; when Burke and McDougal returned to Edinburgh, they moved into Hare's Tanner's Close [[lodging house]], where the two couples soon acquired a reputation for hard drinking and boisterous behaviour.{{sfn|Gilliland|2004}}\n{{-}}\n\n==Events of November 1827 to November 1828==\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = The sites of all but one of the murders\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Burkes House from the Backcourt.jpg\n| width1    = 183\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = View of Burke's house from the rear\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Hares' lodging-house, Tanner's Close.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =Hare's lodging-house in Tanner's Close\n}}\n\nOn 29 November 1827 Donald, a lodger in Hare's house, died of [[edema|dropsy]] shortly before receiving a quarterly army pension while owing \u00a34 of back rent.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=22}} After Hare bemoaned his financial loss to Burke, the pair decided to sell Donald's body to one of the local anatomists. A carpenter provided a coffin for a burial which was to be paid for by the local parish. After he left, the pair opened the coffin, removed the body\u2014which they hid under the bed\u2014filled the coffin with [[Bark (botany)|bark]] from a local [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]]s and resealed it.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=25\u201326}} After dark, on the day the coffin was removed for burial, they took the corpse to Edinburgh University, where they looked for a purchaser. According to Burke's later testimony, they asked for directions to Professor Monro, but a student sent them to Knox's premises in Surgeon's Square.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=100\u201302}}{{efn|It has been suggested that, but for this chance encounter, the public opprobrium which later fell on Knox might have attached to Monro.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=11}}}} Although the men dealt with juniors when discussing the possibility of selling the body, it was Knox who arrived to fix the price at \u00a37 10s.{{efn|\u00a37 10 shillings in 1827 equates to approximately {{Inflation|UK|7.5|1828|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}} Hare received \u00a34 5s while Burke took the balance of \u00a33 5s; Hare's larger share was to cover his loss from Donald's unpaid rent.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=102\u201303}} According to Burke's official confession, as he and Hare left the university, one of Knox's assistants told them that the anatomists \"would be glad to see them again when they had another to dispose of\".{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=251}}\n\nThere is no agreement as to the order in which the murders took place.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=70}} Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the [[sheriff-substitute]], the [[procurator fiscal]] and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was in the form of an interview with the ''[[Edinburgh Courant]]'' that was published on 7 February 1829.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=233\u201334}} These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}}{{efn|The original copy of Hare's confession\u2014given on 1 December and accepted as the basis of his [[Turn state's evidence|turning king's evidence]]\u2014was subsequently lost, although the details were widely reported in the press of the time.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}}}} Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and [[Owen Dudley Edwards]], either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.{{efn|The modern sources that provide a chronological list of the murders are:\n* Brian Bailey, ''Burke and Hare: The Year of the Ghouls''; Bailey also tabulates the order from the two Burke confessions, three contemporary publications and his own;{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=70}}\n* Lisa Rosner, ''The Anatomy Murders'';{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=271\u201372}}\n* [[Owen Dudley Edwards]], ''Burke and Hare''.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=xx\u2013xxi}}}}\n\nMost of the sources agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a [[miller]] named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}} The historian Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=53\u201354}}{{efn|Rosner reflects that the pair were unlikely to change their ''modus operandi'' for the second murder, particularly for a less effective method of smothering a victim.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=54}}}} The novelist [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], who took a keen interest in the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that \"there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed\",{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=106}} as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with [[whisky]], Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=41\u201342}} They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid \u00a310.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|p=108}}{{efn|\u00a310 in 1828 equates to approximately \u00a3875 in 2016.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}} Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight on the victim stifled movement\u2014and thus the ability to make noise\u2014while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been \"practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics\".{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=54}}\n\nThe order of the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the sequence as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire,{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=56\u201357, 79}} while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=41\u201345}}{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=107\u201309}} The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with [[jaundice]] at Hare's lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same ''[[modus operandi]]'' they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=42\u201343}} Simpson was a pensioner who lived in the nearby village of [[Gilmerton]] and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828\u2014the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession\u2014she was invited into the Hares' house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a tea-chest and sold it to Knox.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|p=17}} They received \u00a310 for each body, and Burke's confession records of Simpson's body that \"Dr Knox approved of its being so fresh&nbsp;... but [he] did not ask any questions\".{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=42, 44}} In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave her enough whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman's mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another \u00a310.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=79\u201380}}\n\n[[File:Mary Paterson.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Paterson, killed by Burke while she was intoxicated]]\nBurke met two women in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in [[the Canongate]] area of Edinburgh.{{efn|The two women were described in contemporary accounts as prostitutes, but there is no evidence that this was true.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=116\u201317}}}} He bought the two women alcohol before inviting them back to his lodging for breakfast. The three left the tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother's house. After his brother left for work, Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougal\u2014during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eye\u2014Brown stated that she did not know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep.{{sfnm|Knight|2007|1pp=37\u201339|Bailey|2002|2pp=45\u201347|Lonsdale|1870|3pp=101\u201302}} That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a tea-chest, while McDougal kept Paterson's skirt and petticoats; they were paid \u00a38 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergusson\u2014one of Knox's assistants\u2014asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it \"from an old woman in the Canongate\". Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=41}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=104\u201305}} When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt some point in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke described as \"a stout old woman\", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, she fell asleep in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=133\u201334}} Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid \u00a38.{{sfn|Rosner|2010|pp=126\u201327}} The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her\u2014Hare was not present in the house at the time; her body was sold to Knox for \u00a310.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2014|pp=115\u201316}} Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a \"cinder gatherer\" who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business.

She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further \u00a310 from Knox.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=58}}\n\nBurke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, \"an old woman and a dumb boy, her grandson\", as Burke later recalled in his confession.{{sfn|Bailey|2002|p=182}} While the boy sat by the fire in the kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method.

Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner's Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.{{sfn|Roughead|1921|pp=267\u201328}}\n\nOn 24 June Burke and McDougal departed for Falkirk to visit the latter's father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for \u00a38. It led to an argument between the two men and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=48\u201349}}{{sfn|Rosner|2010|p=149}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = The final two victims\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = James Wilson (Daft Jamie).jpg\n| width1    = 135\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =James Wilson, known locally as Daft Jamie\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2   = Mrs Docherty.jpg\n| width2    = 147\n| alt2   =\n| caption2  = Margaret Docherty\n}}\n\nThe breach between the two men did not last long.

In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke.

As Wilson did not like excess whisky\u2014he preferred [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]]\u2014he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way.

Two other lodgers\u2014Ann and James Gray\u2014were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00&nbsp;pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows at some point in the evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.{{sfn|MacGregor|1884|p=99}}{{sfn|Bailey|2002|pp=72\u201374}}\n\nThe next day the Grays returned, and Ann became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings.

It is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] place which seems to include, primarily, the \"Red Room\" first seen by [[Dale Cooper|Agent Cooper]] in a dream early in the series. As events in the series unfold, it becomes apparent that the characters from the Red Room, the room itself and the Black Lodge, along with the '''White Lodge''', are connected.\n\n==History==\nAt first it is revealed that there is a mysterious dark presence in the woods that the town's Bookhouse Boys have been combatting for generations. Although they do not know what it is, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] policeman [[Deputy Hawk]] says that the Black Lodge is from the mythology of his people, describing it as:\n<blockquote>\nThe shadow-self of the White Lodge. The legend says that every spirit must pass through there on the way to perfection. There, you will meet your own shadow self. My people call it 'The [[Guardian of the Threshold|Dweller on the Threshold]]' ... But it is said, if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate your soul.\n</blockquote>\n\nDuring the second season, [[Windom Earle]] relates a story about the White Lodge:\n<blockquote>\nOnce upon a time, there was a place of great goodness, called the White Lodge. Gentle fawns gamboled there amidst happy, laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and joy filled the air. And when it rained, it rained sweet nectar that infused one's heart with a desire to live life in truth and beauty. Generally speaking, a ghastly place, reeking of virtue's sour smell. Engorged with the whispered prayers of kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools, young and old, compelled to do good without reason ... But, I am happy to point out that our story does not end in this wretched place of saccharine excess. For there's another place, its opposite: A place of almost unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and vicious secrets. No prayers dare enter this frightful maw. The spirits there care not for good deeds or priestly invocations, they're as likely to rip the flesh from your bone as greet you with a happy \"good day.\" And if harnessed, these spirits in this hidden land of unmuffled screams and broken hearts would offer up a power so vast that its bearer might reorder the Earth itself to his liking.\n</blockquote>\n\nAs the Black and White Lodges become more prominent in the story, [[Major Briggs]] claims that during one or more of his disappearances, he had visited the White Lodge and goes on to offer advice regarding it. There is no clear evidence of him being affected by the Black Lodge and it is not clear how he arrives there - aside from a bright flash of light - or what the purpose of his trips were.\n\n==Location==\nAlthough the Red Room began exclusively as a location within Agent [[Dale Cooper]]'s dreams, the inhabitants began appearing in other locations in the town, inciting other elements in the plot, to the point where the Red Room and White/Black Lodge stories became one. After discovering a mysterious map in Owl Cave, it becomes evident to Earle and Cooper\u2014both independently and with different motivations for wanting to visit it\u2014that the entrance to the Black Lodge is located in Ghostwood Forest which surrounds the town of Twin Peaks, at a pool of a substance that smells like scorched [[engine oil]] and surrounded by 12 young [[Platanus|sycamore trees]]. This area is known as Glastonbury Grove.\n\nIt is said that the key to gain entrance to the Black Lodge is fear\u2014usually an act of brutal murder. This is in contrast to the key to the White Lodge, which is love. Another requirement to enter the Black Lodge through the entrance in Glastonbury Grove is that it may only be entered \"...when [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] meet...\" When the above requirements are met and one approaches the pool in Glastonbury Grove, red curtains appear, which the person walks between before the curtains vanish once again.\n\n==Interior==\nThere is little furniture in the Red Room aside from a few armchairs, a wheeled table and a couple of floor lamps. There is also a statue of the [[Venus de Medici]], easily mistaken for the [[Venus de Milo]] (the Venus de Milo can be seen in the hallway). There are no doors to speak of; movement from room to room is accomplished by crossing through another set of red curtains that lead to a narrow hallway. The floor is a chevron pattern of brown and white, and all sides of any room and all walls of any hallway encountered are covered by identical red curtains. In the final episode, a second room in the Lodge is seen, identical to the first. Between the two rooms is a narrow corridor which has the same floor and \"walls\" as the other two rooms.\n\nAlthough the Lodge inhabitants speak English, their voices are warped and strangely clipped and their movements are unnatural (this effect is accomplished by the actors performing in reverse and the footage is then played backwards).

[[Nebraska]] in the [[Midwestern United States]].  The population was 26,397 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Fremont is the county seat and the home of [[Midland University]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Charles Fr\u00e9mont.png|thumb|right|[[John C. Fremont]] is the city's namesake.]]\nFrom the 1830s to the 1860s, the area saw a great deal of traffic due to the [[Mormon Trail]], which passed along the north bank of the [[Platte River]]. A ferry connected the two banks of the [[Elkhorn River]] near Fremont. It was a major overland route for emigrant [[settlers]] going to the West, the military and hunters.\n\nFremont was laid out in 1856 in anticipation that the railroad would be extended to that site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/dodge/fremont/ | title=Fremont, Dodge County | publisher=University of Nebraska | work=Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies | accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> It was named after the American explorer, politician and military official General [[John C.

Original brick portions of the \"[[Lincoln Highway|Old Lincoln Highway]]\" are located east of Fremont, on the way to [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].\n\nFremont is the namesake for the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] neighborhood in Seattle, which was settled by Luther H.

At the time the hotel was being used as apartments, mostly occupied by senior citizens. It also was a meeting place for philanthropic and business organizations, and had a drug store on the northwest corner. The [[explosion]] shattered windows around the city, and the ensuing fire killed 23 people and destroyed most of the city block of the hotel.\n\nFremont gained national attention in 2010 when residents approved a referendum that would ban [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from renting and working in the town.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davey|first=Monica|title=Nebraska Town Votes to Banish Illegal Immigrants|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/us/22fremont.html|accessdate=2010-06-22|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2010-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dwyer Arce|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php|title=Nebraska city voters pass ban on hiring, renting to illegal immigrants|date=2010-06-22|publisher=JURIST - Paper Chase}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nFremont is located along the [[Platte River]], approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} northwest of the largest city in the area, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], and {{convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of the state capitol, [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.85|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|8.80|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-07-02 }}</ref> Fremont is quite flat, lying in the river plain between the Platte and Elkhorn rivers, at an elevation of approximately 366 meters (1,203&nbsp;ft) above sea level.\n\n===Climate===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;\"|Monthly Normal and Record High and Low Temperatures\n|-\n!
