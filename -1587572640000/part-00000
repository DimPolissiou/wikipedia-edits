In 1991, Meadows landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and would go on to become a longtime cast member, appearing on the program until 2000. (Meadows was on the show for ten seasons; this was the record for the longest tenure on the show until it was surpassed by [[Darrell Hammond]] in 2005, whose record was also surpassed by [[Kenan Thompson]] in 2017.) Meadows' lengthy tenure on the show was used as a gag in three monologues when former cast members [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] returned to the show to host, and when [[Alec Baldwin]] hosted for his twelfth time.\n\nMeadows often spoofed famous personalities including [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Tiger Woods]], on SNL, and one time was a quick change artist to pull off an impersonation of both [[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Al Cowlings]] within the timespan of one SNL skit. Some skits had Meadows playing a fictionalized version of himself, such as being a fan of ice hockey on ''Weekend Update'' stating his dissatisfaction with the [[1994 NHL lockout]] and remarking \"What am I supposed to do about this; watch basketball?\" Another sketch as himself was introducing the entire SNL cast as their most famous characters, such as  [[Wayne and Garth]], or Melanie Hutsell as Jan Brady in a sing-a-long denouncing the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which ends with Meadows remarking \"This is personal to me...mainly because I don't have an SNL character to play!\" Eventually he did get an original character with Leon Phelps, \"The Ladies' Man\", a perpetually [[sexual arousal|horny]] [[talk show]] host who falsely believed himself to be the living definition of what women search for in a man. The character was adapted into a 2000 film, ''[[The Ladies Man (2000 film)|The Ladies Man]]'', which followed the character's attempts to find love and a suitable outlet for his beloved radio program. In 2001, he co-starred in ''[[Three Days (2001 film)|Three Days]]''; in 2003 he appeared as Miles McDermott in ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]''.\n[[File:Tim Meadows.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Meadows in 2008]]\nMeadows soon moved on to other projects, including a regular role on the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'' and a supporting role in the 2004 film ''[[The Cookout]]''. He also guest-starred as a client on the hit NBC comedy ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' in the second-season episode \"[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]\". He played a high school principal in ''[[Mean Girls]]'', a film written by (and co-starring) fellow ''SNL'' cast member [[Tina Fey]]. He also had a part in [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]]'s album ''[[White People (album)|White People]]''. In 2007, he appeared in a substantial supporting role in ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]''.\n\nMeadows has appeared in other feature films, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[It's Pat]]'', and ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', all of which were based on popular ''SNL'' characters and had varying degrees of success. He co-starred in the 2006 film ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'' alongside his former ''SNL'' co-stars [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]]. He was also featured in CBS's ''[[Gameshow Marathon (US TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' (summer 2006), has appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' in the recurring role of [[P.K. Winsome]], a conservative pundit and entrepreneur (who made an appearance at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]]), and starred in ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. He was also a frequent guest on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' as a comic field reporter. On May 31, 2008, Meadows threw out a ceremonial first pitch and conducted the seventh-inning stretch at [[Wrigley Field]] during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game against the Colorado Rockies.\n\nIn 2014, Meadows co-starred alongside [[Casey Wilson]] and [[Ken Marino]] in the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Marry Me (U.S. TV series)|Marry Me]]''. He and [[Dan Bucatinsky]] played \"The Kevins\", the gay dads of Annie (played by Wilson) who are both named Kevin.  Since 2013, he has appeared in a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', playing Mr. Glascott, the high school's parrot-owning guidance counselor.  In 2016, he began starring in the [[FOX]] live-action/animation hybrid ''[[Son of Zorn]]'' opposite [[Cheryl Hines]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]]. He also had a recurring role in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' as Jake Peralta's [[cannibal]] prison cellmate.\n\nMeadows continues to perform improv in [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]], most frequently at venues such as the [[ImprovOlympic]] and [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioimprov.com|title=The iO Theater|website=The iO Theater|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref> With [[Heather Anne Campbell]] and [[Miles Stroth]], Meadows frequently performed in the improvised sketch show, ''Heather, Miles, and Tim'' in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMeadows married Michelle Taylor in 1997, together they have two sons.

Meadows' lengthy tenure on the show was used as a gag in three monologues when former cast members [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] returned to the show to host, and when [[Alec Baldwin]] hosted for his twelfth time.\n\nMeadows often spoofed famous personalities including [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Tiger Woods]], on SNL, and one time was a quick change artist to pull off an impersonation of both [[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Al Cowlings]] within the timespan of one SNL skit. Some skits had Meadows playing a fictionalized version of himself, such as being a fan of ice hockey on ''Weekend Update'' stating his dissatisfaction with the [[1994 NHL lockout]] and remarking \"What am I supposed to do about this; watch basketball?\" Another sketch as himself was introducing the entire SNL cast as their most famous characters, such as  [[Wayne and Garth]], or Melanie Hutsell as Jan Brady in a sing-a-long denouncing the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which ends with Meadows remarking \"This is personal to me...mainly because I don't have an SNL character to play!\" Eventually he did get an original character with Leon Phelps, \"The Ladies' Man\", a perpetually [[sexual arousal|horny]] [[talk show]] host who falsely believed himself to be the living definition of what women search for in a man. The character was adapted into a 2000 film, ''[[The Ladies Man (2000 film)|The Ladies Man]]'', which followed the character's attempts to find love and a suitable outlet for his beloved radio program. In 2001, he co-starred in ''[[Three Days (2001 film)|Three Days]]''; in 2003 he appeared as Miles McDermott in ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]''.\n[[File:Tim Meadows.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Meadows in 2008]]\nMeadows soon moved on to other projects, including a regular role on the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'' and a supporting role in the 2004 film ''[[The Cookout]]''. He also guest-starred as a client on the hit NBC comedy ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' in the second-season episode \"[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]\". He played a high school principal in ''[[Mean Girls]]'', a film written by (and co-starring) fellow ''SNL'' cast member [[Tina Fey]]. He also had a part in [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]]'s album ''[[White People (album)|White People]]''. In 2007, he appeared in a substantial supporting role in ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]''.\n\nMeadows has appeared in other feature films, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[It's Pat]]'', and ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', all of which were based on popular ''SNL'' characters and had varying degrees of success. He co-starred in the 2006 film ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'' alongside his former ''SNL'' co-stars [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]]. He was also featured in CBS's ''[[Gameshow Marathon (US TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' (summer 2006), has appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' in the recurring role of [[P.K. Winsome]], a conservative pundit and entrepreneur (who made an appearance at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]]), and starred in ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. He was also a frequent guest on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' as a comic field reporter. On May 31, 2008, Meadows threw out a ceremonial first pitch and conducted the seventh-inning stretch at [[Wrigley Field]] during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game against the Colorado Rockies.\n\nIn 2014, Meadows co-starred alongside [[Casey Wilson]] and [[Ken Marino]] in the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Marry Me (U.S. TV series)|Marry Me]]''. He and [[Dan Bucatinsky]] played \"The Kevins\", the gay dads of Annie (played by Wilson) who are both named Kevin.  Since 2013, he has appeared in a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', playing Mr. Glascott, the high school's parrot-owning guidance counselor.  In 2016, he began starring in the [[FOX]] live-action/animation hybrid ''[[Son of Zorn]]'' opposite [[Cheryl Hines]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]]. He also had a recurring role in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' as Jake Peralta's [[cannibal]] prison cellmate.\n\nMeadows continues to perform improv in [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]], most frequently at venues such as the [[ImprovOlympic]] and [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioimprov.com|title=The iO Theater|website=The iO Theater|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref> With [[Heather Anne Campbell]] and [[Miles Stroth]], Meadows frequently performed in the improvised sketch show, ''Heather, Miles, and Tim'' in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMeadows married Michelle Taylor in 1997, together they have two sons. They divorced in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.people.com/parents/tim-meadows-on-separating-fact-from-fiction-for-sons/amp/ |title = Tim Meadows on Separating Fact from Fiction for Sons}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
