{"title_page": "Culinary linguistics", "text_new": "Culinary linguistics,  a sub-branch of [[applied linguistics]], is the study of food and language across various interdisciplinary fields such as [[linguistic]], [[anthropology]], [[sociolinguistics]], and consumption politics and globalisation.<ref name=\"What words bring to the table\">{{cite journal|last1= Cavanaugh|first1= Jillian R.|last2= Riley|first2= Kathleen C.|last3= Jaffe|first3= Alexandra|last4= Jourdan|first4= Christine|last5= Karreb\u00e6k|first5= Martha|last6= Paugh|first6= Amy|year= 2014|title= What Words Bring to the Table: The Linguistic Anthropological Toolkit as Applied to the Study of Food |journal= Journal of Linguistic Anthropology |volume= 24|pages= 84-97|doi= 10.1111/jola.12038}}</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\n\n=== Written Language ===\nScholarly inquiry that deals with written language employs [[semiotics]] and [[ethnolinguistics]] methodologies, utilizing operational frameworks such as corpus [[linguistics]], [[language ideology]], written [[discourse analysis]], [[dialectology]], and [[theoretical lexicography]]. Research typically engages with various media forms, official documents or [[white papers]], and text found in food production sites - markets, production facilities, restaurants, etc. This generally entails the empirical analysis of words and [[phrases]] (eg. [[idioms]] or [[metaphors]]) to investigate intertextual relations between writer/producer, audience, and sociocultural/political realities.<ref name=\"What words bring to the table\"></ref>\n\n=== Spoken Language ===\nAnother significant fraction of culinary linguistics deals with spoken language in which methodologies such as food-oriented interviews, collaborative translation, participant [[observation]], and [[focus group]] dialogues are used and are more prominent. This usually invokes similar concepts like [[language socialization]], spoken discourse analysis, and [[paralinguistics]].\n\n=== Visual Language ===\nApart from written and spoken means of communicating about foods, one also uses [[body language]] to portray their attitudes towards food. For example, simply from reading one's expressions, the audience can tell whether the food is is \"nice\", \"disgusting\" or \"mmm\" to the taster. Besides expressions, actions such as emptying a glass can inform interlocutors that it is the drinker's final sip, as well as indicating the end of the talk <ref name=\"Food and Language\">{{cite journal|last1= Karrebaek|first1= Martha Sif|last2= Riley|first2= Kathleen C|last3= Cavanaugh|first3= Jilian R|year= 2018|title= Food and Language: Production, Consumption, and Circulation of Meaning and Value|journal= Annual Reviews of Anthropology|pages= 17-26|publisher= Annual Reviews|doi= 10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050109)}}</ref>. \n\n== Food Politics ==\nCulinary linguistics mainly addresses [[persuasive writing]] in [[food politics]], occurred in the processes of production, distribution, labelling, agency, responsibility, and consumption. For example, an excerpt from Guy Cook\u2019s article \u201cSweet talking: food, language, and democracy\u201d <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\">{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Guy|year= 2010|title= Sweet Talking: Food, Language, and Democracy|journal= Language Teaching |volume= 43|issue= 2|pages= 168-181|doi= 10.1017/S0261444809990140}}</ref> reads:\n\n{{quote|\u201cYou can buy the same product at a low price in one aisle, or at a high price in another aisle. The difference is in the description. A loaf of white bread without words, for example, costs \u00a30.75p for 400g, but white breadcrumbs catchily labelled as \u2018a handful of breadcrumbs\u2019 cost \u00a31.19 for 100g. People are sweet-talked into buying such things.\u201d (Cook 2010)}}\n\nProminent topics across food language and politics include product labelling, debates over [[genetically modified food]] (GM foods), and [[organic food]]marketing (see [[food marketing]]).<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== Product Labelling ===\nApplying culinary linguistics to product labelling, research <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> broaches the themes of linguistic ambiguity; [[rhetorical device|rhetorical figures]] - alliteration, metaphor, hyperbole and superlatives, rhythm and \u2018poetic\u2019 phrasing; [[narrative techniques]]; and sociolinguistics that pertains to sensory/sensual connotations associated with food description (see also [[food and sexuality]]).\n\nFor example, the themes of ambiguity and sensual language can be extrapolated via syntactic analysis (eg. noun-modifiers) of labels like:\n\n{{quote|\"masterfully prepared sweetened real fruit juice pieces, made from a blend of pomegranate and other select concentrated fruit juices\", are dipped in \"our extra creamy pure dark chocolate\" to create this \"decadent taste sensation\"\n(Cook 2010)<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>}}\n\n{{quote|Potato chips - \u201cveggie chips\u201d; milk shakes - \u201csmoothies\u201d; sugary drinks - \u201cflavored water\u201d; etc.\n(Irmak et al. 2011)<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\">{{cite journal|last1= Irmak|first1= Caglar|last2= Vallen|first2= Beth|last3= Robinson|first3= Stefanie R.|year= 2011|title= The Impact of Product Name on Dieters\u2019 and Nondieters\u2019 Food Evaluations and Consumption|journal= Journal of Consumer Research |volume= 38|issue= 2|pages= 390-405|doi= 10.1086/660044}}</ref>}}\n\n====Product labelling and Health====\nArguments around vague language in food labelling are also tied to issues of health (see [[nutrition facts label]]). For example, research on [[infant formula]] addresses [[fine print]] as a critical realization of [[multimodality]] and its effects on communication, particularly in conveying the saliency of health information. Research have additionally expounded on the links between \u201cthe ambiguity inherent in the naming of some products\u201d<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref> and the differences in perceptions of healthfulness and taste by dieters and non-dieters. Furthermore, such research broaches [[psycholinguistics]] by noting that these different groups demonstrate differing capacities to subconsciously alter their taste perceptions based on languages in food labels. Existing linguistic research on food labelling and health also addresses objective meal sizes, nutrient content claims (e.g., \u201clow fat\u201d), health benefit claims (e.g., \u201cmay increase bone density\u201d; and brand names. <ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref>\n\n==== Product labelling and Environmentalism ====\nCulinary linguistics further delineates ties with the social and environmental facets of food politics. For example, conventional [[marketing strategies]], that appeal to emotion and self interest, have supplanted rhetorics around [[environmentalism]]\n\n\u201cIn its list of \u2018Ten Reasons to Buy Organic\u2019, The Soil Association (the main UK organic campaign group and certification body) at one time moved its alliterative slogan \u2018Top for Taste\u2019 to first position and demoted \u2018Good for Wildlife\u2019 from number one to number ten\u201d.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== GM and anti-GM debates ===\nMore closely aligned with political discourse analysis, culinary linguistics has also been applied to debates about GM food products, paying particular attention to [[lexical items]] and connotations. Language associated with emotion and hysteria is often employed in pro-GM arguments through referencing anti-GM rhetoric, a linguistic technique that derides their opposition\u2019s persuasions as [[fearmongering]] rather than objectively substantial.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> Furthermore, military metaphors (see [[war as metaphor]]) were noted to be commonplace in these arguments, foregrounding the perception of threat. <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n== Language and Food Service ==\n=== Menus ===\nDan Jurafsky (PhD; Linguistics and Computer Science; [[Stanford University]]) observed the utility of culinary linguistics in his research that analysed thousands of [[menu]]s in the [[United States]], asserting that prices could be accurately predicted simply from looking at the language used to describe dishes in these menus.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/82f41202-27f3-11e4-ae44-00144feabdc0 |title= The secret language of food |author= Jurafsky, Dan |date= August 22, 2014|publisher= Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe more expensive the restaurant, the fancier the words. Difficult foreign words (\u201ctonnarelli\u201d, \u201cchoclo\u201d, \u201cbastilla\u201d, \u201cpersillade\u201d, \u201coyako\u201d) are an implicit signal of the high-educational status of the menu writer and, by extension, the customer \u2026 expensive menus were shorter and more implicit. By contrast, the wordy menus of middle-priced restaurants were stuffed with adjectives (\u201cfresh\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201cmild\u201d, \u201ccrisp\u201d, \u201ctender\u201d, \u201cgolden brown\u201d), while positive but vague words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201csavoury\u201d were used by the cheapest restaurants; high-status restaurants want their customers to presuppose that food will be fresh, crisp and delicious. The surfeit of adjectives on middle-priced menus is thus a kind of overcompensation, a sign of status anxiety, and only the cheapest restaurants, in which the tastiness of the food might be in question, must overly protest the toothsomeness of their treats.\u201d\n\n=== Food Reviews ===\nFood reviews (see [[food critic]]) are written to provide feedback about [[foodservice]] in [[restaurants]]. For \u201ceaters\u201d, reading these reviews help them to decide the places to eat. For linguists, analysing the language such as metaphors and emotions, written in the reviews, increases their understanding about human psychology.<ref name=\"The language of Food\">{{cite book|last = Jurafsky|first = Dan|title = The language of food: A linguist reads the menu|publisher = WW Norton & Company|year = 2014}}</ref>\nStudies about the use of language in food reviews revealed patterns in the word choice for good and bad reviews. Good reviews reflect positive feedback about the customers\u2019 experiences in restaurants while bad reviews show customers\u2019 dissatisfaction about their experiences when they visit the restaurants. However, a comparison of studies conducted with different populations, revealed that these patterns varied across [[cultures]].\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, they discovered patterns in the word choices of American food reviewers, by analysing one million online restaurant reviews on Yelp. Their findings showed that people generally use positive emotional words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d in good reviews while negative emotional words such as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d were found in bad reviews. Specifically, in bad reviews, a phenomenon \u2018negative differentiation\u2019 surfaced. Compared to good reviews that contained positive vague words, in bad reviews, food reviewers describe the taste, smell and appearance with greater precision and wider range of vocabulary. They also used words related to tragedy or trauma, on top of using collective [[pronouns]] such as \u201cwe\u201d to emphasize their victimisation by the poor dining experiences.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed the difference in metaphors used in good reviews to describe dining experiences in expensive and cheap restaurants. Reviews containing metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as \u201cseductively seared foie gras\u201d were often used to describe foods served in expensive restaurants. On the other hand, metaphors of drugs or addiction such as \u201cthe wings are addicting\u201d were used to describe the food in cheap restaurants.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nA similar study was conducted to study the food reviews in [[Turkey]]. Its findings revealed that Turkish food reviewers do not use sexual or drug metaphors in their reviews, possibly due to their culture. Generally, they used expressions related to \u201cto faint\u201d to express delight in all their reviews. Unlike Americans, Turkish food reviewers do not differentiate between the price of the restaurants. Instead, they prioritise authentic and healthy Turkish foods. Hence, reviews containing these words are deemed to be good reviews.<ref>{{cite thesis|last= Cupery|first= Maria Joy|date= 2017|title= Food and Language: Price-Based Lexical Variation in Turkish Online Restaurant Reviews|publisher= ProQuest LLC}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature in food reviews that determines the quality of food is the use of onomatopoeia. Food reviewers use onomatopoeia to express the various degrees of taste, texture and appearance of the foods to help their readers visualise the images. In a study about the usage of [[onomatopoeia]] in food reviews, researchers gathered common words that were used to describe different cuisines. For example, \u201cZuruzuru\u201d (Japanese) was used in reviews to describe noodles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Mori|first3= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Discovering pattern of onomatopoeia used in food reviews|journal= The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems|publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |doi= 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505214}}</ref> Another similar study further explained that since such words resemble the sounds of eating noodles, the food reviews can be understood by foreigners as well. <ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Sato|first3= Tomomasa|last4= Mori|first4= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Extraction of Onomatopoeia Used for Foods from Food Reviews and its Application to Restaurant Search|journal= WWW 2012 Companion|pages= 719-728|publisher= International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)|doi= 10.1145/2187980.2188192)}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistics in Food Preparation ==\n\n=== Food Blogs ===\nFood blogs (see [[food blogging]]) are part of the written and asynchronous genre of CMC [[Computer-mediated communication]] as they revolve around the preparation, consumption and evaluation of food in all varieties and contexts.\n<ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\">{{cite book|editor-last= Gerdhardt|editor-first= Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first= Maximiliane|editor3-last= Ley|editor3-first= Susanne|title= Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company|date= July 4, 2013|pages= 53-82|chapter= \u201cWhen making pie, all ingredients must be chilled.Including you: Lexical, syntactic and interactive features in online discourse\u2014a synchronic study of food blogs\u201d|isbn= 978-9027202932}}</ref> By allowing continuous revisions and comments to be added, food blogs reflect the relations of food with its readers across varied cultural backgrounds <ref name=\"Food and Language\"></ref>. \n==== Special purpose discourse ====\nA prominent [[lexicon|lexical]] feature of food blogs is special purpose vocabulary, or as Crystal in [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Crystal|first1 = David|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher = Cambridge: CUP|year = 1996}}</ref>  terms \u201coccupational variety\u201d, indicated by \u201cthe frequent and central use of special vocabulary and jargon.\u201d The corpus of food blogs include terms from various categories. Diemer and Frobenius distinguish the vocabulary on food blogs into seven categories: 1) food jargon such as recipe or food 2)  ingredients, food and recipe types, such as salt or cream 3) non-English terms like vollkorn and gelato 4) kitchen tools, for example bowl and pan 5) preparation methods, such as heat and bake 6)amounts and measures, like cup or minutes 7) blog-specific terminology such as comments or post. <ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\"></ref>\n\n==== Culinary verb use ====\nThe most common non-auxiliary verbs (see [[auxiliary verb]]) are action verbs that describe activities in the lexical field of [[cooking]], like make, add, cook, serve, take, chop, bake or fry. In addition, there are activities related to food procurement, such as buy or pick, and consumption, such as eat.\n\n=== Recipes ===\n\n[[Recipes]] may come in written or spoken form. Written recipes are considered procedural discourse, which is agency neutral and time neutral.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Wharton|first1 = Tim|year= 2012|title=Recipes: Beyond the Words|journal=Gastronomica:The Journal for Food Studies ,Vol.10No.4|pages=67-73|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|doi= 10.1525/gfc.2010.10.4.67)}}</ref> \u201cThis agency/ time neutrality is reflected in the use of the imperative form\u201d, which has no overt subject and no grammatical tense in English. Spoken recipes can be likened to narratives and sets of instructions, as they \u201ctend to switch back and forth between the first person past tense of the former and the second person imperative of the latter <ref>{{cite journal |last= Norrick |first= Neal |date= 2011 |title= Conversational Recipe Telling |url= https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010|journal= Journal of Pragmatics |volume=43|issue=11 |pages= 2740\u20132761  |doi= 10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010 |access-date= March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooking Shows ===\n\n[[Cooking show]]s or cookery programmes are forms of spoken discourse in culinary linguistics. It involves the performance of food preparation in front of a live or television audience by a host, typically, a [[celebrity chef]].\n\n==== Instructions ====\nAn essential part of cooking shows is the delivery of instructions during food preparation. Such instructions are usually influenced by the linguistic styles of different celebrity chef personalities. For example, British celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] is known for employing slang in his performance of culinary speech. He often substitutes the traditional terms like \u201cto add\u201d with a slang verb, \u201cto chuck\u201d (meaning \u2018to throw\u2019).\n\n==== Expressing Emotions ====\nThe medium of television allows for emotions in culinary discourse to be conveyed through visual and aural signifiers.\n\n===== Visual language =====\nThe use of facial expressions and [[body language]] are visual ways in which emotions arising from food preparation and consumption are communicated to the audience.\n\u201c In humans, the characteristic facial expressions that coincide with the experience of disgust and distaste include behaviors such as gaping and nose wrinkling, are usually elicited by nausea or revulsion. These negative expressions are typically evoked by unpalatable tastes, such as bitter, both in children and in adults. Palatable tastes, such as [[sucrose]], are thought to induce sensory pleasure, which elicits less frequently expressed appetitive reactions, such as facial relaxation and smiling and sucking movements.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Forestell|first1= Catherine A|last2= Menella|first2= Julie A|year= 2012|title=The Relationship between Infant Facial Expressions and Food Acceptance|journal=Curr Nutr Rep|pages= 141-147|publisher=PMC|doi= 10.1007/s13668-017-0205-y)}}</ref>\n\n===== Verbal language =====\nIn terms of verbal cues, vocal sounds such as groaning [\u201cmmmm\u201d sound] often denote a sense of satisfaction and pleasure towards the consumption of food. The personification of food is also a linguistic technique of establishing intimacy and emotional connection in the performance of food preparation and consumption. This may sometimes involve interaction between chefs and their culinary creation.\n\n\u201cJamie is bending the spaghettini so that they will fit tightly into the pan into the boiling water, and as he does so, he addresses the pasta as if it were one of his \u201cmates\u201d: We\u2019ve got some quite good quality pasta here, right, so this is spaghettini it cooks in around 7 minutes right so this goes in boiling salted water it\u2019s supposed to be, just bend it around, get in there, go on mate, get in there,here we go\u2026\u201d\n<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Gerdhardt |editor-first=Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first=Maximiliane|editor3-last=Ley|editor3-first=Susanne|title=Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=July 4, 2013 |pages=53-82 |chapter= Passionate about food: Jamie and Nigella and the performance of food-talk |isbn=978-9027202932}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Research typically engages with various media forms, official documents or [[white papers]], and text found in food production sites - markets, production facilities, restaurants, etc. This generally entails the empirical analysis of words and [[phrases]] (eg. [[idioms]] or [[metaphors]]) to investigate intertextual relations between writer/producer, audience, and sociocultural/political realities.<ref name=\"What words bring to the table\"></ref>\n\n=== Spoken Language ===\nAnother significant fraction of culinary linguistics deals with spoken language in which methodologies such as food-oriented interviews, collaborative translation, participant [[observation]], and [[focus group]] dialogues are used and are more prominent. This usually invokes similar concepts like [[language socialization]], spoken discourse analysis, and [[paralinguistics]].\n\n=== Visual Language ===\nApart from written and spoken means of communicating about foods, one also uses [[body language]] to portray their attitudes towards food. For example, simply from reading one's expressions, the audience can tell whether the food is is \"nice\", \"disgusting\" or \"mmm\" to the taster. Besides expressions, actions such as emptying a glass can inform interlocutors that it is the drinker's final sip, as well as indicating the end of the talk <ref name=\"Food and Language\">{{cite journal|last1= Karrebaek|first1= Martha Sif|last2= Riley|first2= Kathleen C|last3= Cavanaugh|first3= Jilian R|year= 2018|title= Food and Language: Production, Consumption, and Circulation of Meaning and Value|journal= Annual Reviews of Anthropology|pages= 17-26|publisher= Annual Reviews|doi= https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050109)}}</ref>. \n\n== Food Politics ==\nCulinary linguistics mainly addresses [[persuasive writing]] in [[food politics]], occurred in the processes of production, distribution, labelling, agency, responsibility, and consumption. For example, an excerpt from Guy Cook\u2019s article \u201cSweet talking: food, language, and democracy\u201d <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\">{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Guy|year= 2010|title= Sweet Talking: Food, Language, and Democracy|journal= Language Teaching |volume= 43|issue= 2|pages= 168-181|doi= 10.1017/S0261444809990140}}</ref> reads:\n\n{{quote|\u201cYou can buy the same product at a low price in one aisle, or at a high price in another aisle. The difference is in the description. A loaf of white bread without words, for example, costs \u00a30.75p for 400g, but white breadcrumbs catchily labelled as \u2018a handful of breadcrumbs\u2019 cost \u00a31.19 for 100g. People are sweet-talked into buying such things.\u201d (Cook 2010)}}\n\nProminent topics across food language and politics include product labelling, debates over [[genetically modified food]] (GM foods), and [[organic food]]marketing (see [[food marketing]]).<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== Product Labelling ===\nApplying culinary linguistics to product labelling, research <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> broaches the themes of linguistic ambiguity; [[rhetorical device|rhetorical figures]] - alliteration, metaphor, hyperbole and superlatives, rhythm and \u2018poetic\u2019 phrasing; [[narrative techniques]]; and sociolinguistics that pertains to sensory/sensual connotations associated with food description (see also [[food and sexuality]]).\n\nFor example, the themes of ambiguity and sensual language can be extrapolated via syntactic analysis (eg. noun-modifiers) of labels like:\n\n{{quote|\"masterfully prepared sweetened real fruit juice pieces, made from a blend of pomegranate and other select concentrated fruit juices\", are dipped in \"our extra creamy pure dark chocolate\" to create this \"decadent taste sensation\"\n(Cook 2010)<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>}}\n\n{{quote|Potato chips - \u201cveggie chips\u201d; milk shakes - \u201csmoothies\u201d; sugary drinks - \u201cflavored water\u201d; etc.\n(Irmak et al. 2011)<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\">{{cite journal|last1= Irmak|first1= Caglar|last2= Vallen|first2= Beth|last3= Robinson|first3= Stefanie R.|year= 2011|title= The Impact of Product Name on Dieters\u2019 and Nondieters\u2019 Food Evaluations and Consumption|journal= Journal of Consumer Research |volume= 38|issue= 2|pages= 390-405|doi= 10.1086/660044}}</ref>}}\n\n====Product labelling and Health====\nArguments around vague language in food labelling are also tied to issues of health (see [[nutrition facts label]]). For example, research on [[infant formula]] addresses [[fine print]] as a critical realization of [[multimodality]] and its effects on communication, particularly in conveying the saliency of health information. Research have additionally expounded on the links between \u201cthe ambiguity inherent in the naming of some products\u201d<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref> and the differences in perceptions of healthfulness and taste by dieters and non-dieters. Furthermore, such research broaches [[psycholinguistics]] by noting that these different groups demonstrate differing capacities to subconsciously alter their taste perceptions based on languages in food labels. Existing linguistic research on food labelling and health also addresses objective meal sizes, nutrient content claims (e.g., \u201clow fat\u201d), health benefit claims (e.g., \u201cmay increase bone density\u201d; and brand names. <ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref>\n\n==== Product labelling and Environmentalism ====\nCulinary linguistics further delineates ties with the social and environmental facets of food politics. For example, conventional [[marketing strategies]], that appeal to emotion and self interest, have supplanted rhetorics around [[environmentalism]]\n\n\u201cIn its list of \u2018Ten Reasons to Buy Organic\u2019, The Soil Association (the main UK organic campaign group and certification body) at one time moved its alliterative slogan \u2018Top for Taste\u2019 to first position and demoted \u2018Good for Wildlife\u2019 from number one to number ten\u201d.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== GM and anti-GM debates ===\nMore closely aligned with political discourse analysis, culinary linguistics has also been applied to debates about GM food products, paying particular attention to [[lexical items]] and connotations. Language associated with emotion and hysteria is often employed in pro-GM arguments through referencing anti-GM rhetoric, a linguistic technique that derides their opposition\u2019s persuasions as [[fearmongering]] rather than objectively substantial.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> Furthermore, military metaphors (see [[war as metaphor]]) were noted to be commonplace in these arguments, foregrounding the perception of threat. <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n== Language and Food Service ==\n=== Menus ===\nDan Jurafsky (PhD; Linguistics and Computer Science; [[Stanford University]]) observed the utility of culinary linguistics in his research that analysed thousands of [[menu]]s in the [[United States]], asserting that prices could be accurately predicted simply from looking at the language used to describe dishes in these menus.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/82f41202-27f3-11e4-ae44-00144feabdc0 |title= The secret language of food |author= Jurafsky, Dan |date= August 22, 2014|publisher= Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe more expensive the restaurant, the fancier the words. Difficult foreign words (\u201ctonnarelli\u201d, \u201cchoclo\u201d, \u201cbastilla\u201d, \u201cpersillade\u201d, \u201coyako\u201d) are an implicit signal of the high-educational status of the menu writer and, by extension, the customer \u2026 expensive menus were shorter and more implicit. By contrast, the wordy menus of middle-priced restaurants were stuffed with adjectives (\u201cfresh\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201cmild\u201d, \u201ccrisp\u201d, \u201ctender\u201d, \u201cgolden brown\u201d), while positive but vague words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201csavoury\u201d were used by the cheapest restaurants; high-status restaurants want their customers to presuppose that food will be fresh, crisp and delicious. The surfeit of adjectives on middle-priced menus is thus a kind of overcompensation, a sign of status anxiety, and only the cheapest restaurants, in which the tastiness of the food might be in question, must overly protest the toothsomeness of their treats.\u201d\n\n=== Food Reviews ===\nFood reviews (see [[food critic]]) are written to provide feedback about [[foodservice]] in [[restaurants]]. For \u201ceaters\u201d, reading these reviews help them to decide the places to eat. For linguists, analysing the language such as metaphors and emotions, written in the reviews, increases their understanding about human psychology.<ref name=\"The language of Food\">{{cite book|last = Jurafsky|first = Dan|title = The language of food: A linguist reads the menu|publisher = WW Norton & Company|year = 2014}}</ref>\nStudies about the use of language in food reviews revealed patterns in the word choice for good and bad reviews. Good reviews reflect positive feedback about the customers\u2019 experiences in restaurants while bad reviews show customers\u2019 dissatisfaction about their experiences when they visit the restaurants. However, a comparison of studies conducted with different populations, revealed that these patterns varied across [[cultures]].\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, they discovered patterns in the word choices of American food reviewers, by analysing one million online restaurant reviews on Yelp. Their findings showed that people generally use positive emotional words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d in good reviews while negative emotional words such as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d were found in bad reviews. Specifically, in bad reviews, a phenomenon \u2018negative differentiation\u2019 surfaced. Compared to good reviews that contained positive vague words, in bad reviews, food reviewers describe the taste, smell and appearance with greater precision and wider range of vocabulary. They also used words related to tragedy or trauma, on top of using collective [[pronouns]] such as \u201cwe\u201d to emphasize their victimisation by the poor dining experiences.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed the difference in metaphors used in good reviews to describe dining experiences in expensive and cheap restaurants. Reviews containing metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as \u201cseductively seared foie gras\u201d were often used to describe foods served in expensive restaurants. On the other hand, metaphors of drugs or addiction such as \u201cthe wings are addicting\u201d were used to describe the food in cheap restaurants.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nA similar study was conducted to study the food reviews in [[Turkey]]. Its findings revealed that Turkish food reviewers do not use sexual or drug metaphors in their reviews, possibly due to their culture. Generally, they used expressions related to \u201cto faint\u201d to express delight in all their reviews. Unlike Americans, Turkish food reviewers do not differentiate between the price of the restaurants. Instead, they prioritise authentic and healthy Turkish foods. Hence, reviews containing these words are deemed to be good reviews.<ref>{{cite thesis|last= Cupery|first= Maria Joy|date= 2017|title= Food and Language: Price-Based Lexical Variation in Turkish Online Restaurant Reviews|publisher= ProQuest LLC}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature in food reviews that determines the quality of food is the use of onomatopoeia. Food reviewers use onomatopoeia to express the various degrees of taste, texture and appearance of the foods to help their readers visualise the images. In a study about the usage of [[onomatopoeia]] in food reviews, researchers gathered common words that were used to describe different cuisines. For example, \u201cZuruzuru\u201d (Japanese) was used in reviews to describe noodles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Mori|first3= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Discovering pattern of onomatopoeia used in food reviews|journal= The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems|publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |doi= 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505214}}</ref> Another similar study further explained that since such words resemble the sounds of eating noodles, the food reviews can be understood by foreigners as well. <ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Sato|first3= Tomomasa|last4= Mori|first4= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Extraction of Onomatopoeia Used for Foods from Food Reviews and its Application to Restaurant Search|journal= WWW 2012 Companion|pages= 719-728|publisher= International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)|doi= 10.1145/2187980.2188192)}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistics in Food Preparation ==\n\n=== Food Blogs ===\nFood blogs (see [[food blogging]]) are part of the written and asynchronous genre of CMC [[Computer-mediated communication]] as they revolve around the preparation, consumption and evaluation of food in all varieties and contexts.\n<ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\">{{cite book|editor-last= Gerdhardt|editor-first= Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first= Maximiliane|editor3-last= Ley|editor3-first= Susanne|title= Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company|date= July 4, 2013|pages= 53-82|chapter= \u201cWhen making pie, all ingredients must be chilled.Including you: Lexical, syntactic and interactive features in online discourse\u2014a synchronic study of food blogs\u201d|isbn= 978-9027202932}}</ref> By allowing continuous revisions and comments to be added, food blogs reflect the relations of food with its readers across varied cultural backgrounds <ref name=\"Food and Language\"></ref>. \n==== Special purpose discourse ====\nA prominent [[lexicon|lexical]] feature of food blogs is special purpose vocabulary, or as Crystal in [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Crystal|first1 = David|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher = Cambridge: CUP|year = 1996}}</ref>  terms \u201coccupational variety\u201d, indicated by \u201cthe frequent and central use of special vocabulary and jargon.\u201d The corpus of food blogs include terms from various categories.

During the [[French and Indian War]], a group of \"Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan\" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian [[Daniel Li\u00e9nard de Beaujeu]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Empires at War|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company |location=New York|page=68|isbn=9780802719355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqukoiTFL_oC&pg=PA68}}</ref> In the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups to ally with the rebel Continentals.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=400|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA400&lpg=PA400#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, the Native Americans fought the United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]] as part of the [[Council of Three Fires]]. During the [[War of 1812]], they held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack [[Chicago]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Keating|first=Ann|title=Rising Up from Indian Country|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}</ref> in retaliation against American expansion. This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833. In exchange for their ceding their lands in the area, they were to receive monetary payments and lands west of the Mississippi in [[Indian Territory]].\n\n===Milwaukee since European settlement===\n[[File:Solomon Juneau.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Solomon Juneau]], who helped establish the city of Milwaukee]]\n\nEuropeans had arrived in the Milwaukee area prior to the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name=\"St-Pierre, T 1895\">St-Pierre, T.

Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC&id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265\u2013267}}}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Milwaukee birdseye map by Bailey (1872). loc call no g4124m-pm010450.jpg|thumb|Illustrated map of Milwaukee in 1872]]\n\nMilwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C.

In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States.

Milwaukee gained its reputation as the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but for the sense of community which the immigrants established here.<ref name=\"Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860\">Conzen, Kathleen Neils.

The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. \"The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.\" [http://maxkade.iupui.edu/ Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]].

The city celebrates its German culture by annually hosting a German Fest in July and an [[Oktoberfest]] in October.

Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church.

This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.\n\nMilwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the \"Lake Parkway\" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).\n\nOne of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.\n\nThe tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{seealso|Climate change in Wisconsin}}\nMilwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|71.8|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|22.3|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=004627| title=Historical Weather for Milwaukee, Wisconsin| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=October 2, 2006}}</ref>\n\nBecause of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called \"lake breeze\" \u2013 a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].\n\nAs the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.\n\nAside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.\n\nThunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the [[precipitation]].

Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.\n\nThere was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name=\"milwaukeehistory.net\" />\n\n[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]\nBecause of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].\n\nReshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.\n\nIn 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname \"Cream City\", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.\n\n[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.\n\nAlong with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919\u20131922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Brewing===\n{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents.

With the election of Mayor [[John Norquist|John O.

The Common Council consists of 15 members, one from each district in the city.

During the [[French and Indian War]], a group of \"Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan\" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian [[Daniel Li\u00e9nard de Beaujeu]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Empires at War|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company |location=New York|page=68|isbn=9780802719355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqukoiTFL_oC&pg=PA68}}</ref> In the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups to ally with the rebel Continentals.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=400|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA400&lpg=PA400#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, the Native Americans fought the United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]] as part of the [[Council of Three Fires]]. During the [[War of 1812]], they held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack [[Chicago]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Keating|first=Ann|title=Rising Up from Indian Country|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}</ref> in retaliation against American expansion. This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833. In exchange for their ceding their lands in the area, they were to receive monetary payments and lands west of the Mississippi in [[Indian Territory]].\n\n===Milwaukee since European settlement===\n[[File:Solomon Juneau.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Solomon Juneau]], who helped establish the city of Milwaukee]]\n\nEuropeans had arrived in the Milwaukee area prior to the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name=\"St-Pierre, T 1895\">St-Pierre, T.

Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC&id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265\u2013267}}}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Milwaukee birdseye map by Bailey (1872). loc call no g4124m-pm010450.jpg|thumb|Illustrated map of Milwaukee in 1872]]\n\nMilwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C.

In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States.

The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. \"The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.\" [http://maxkade.iupui.edu/ Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]].

Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church.

The north\u2013south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east\u2013west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.\n\nMilwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the \"Lake Parkway\" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).\n\nOne of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.\n\nThe tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{seealso|Climate change in Wisconsin}}\nMilwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|71.8|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|22.3|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=004627| title=Historical Weather for Milwaukee, Wisconsin| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=October 2, 2006}}</ref>\n\nBecause of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called \"lake breeze\" \u2013 a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].\n\nAs the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.\n\nAside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.\n\nThunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the [[precipitation]].

Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.\n\nThere was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name=\"milwaukeehistory.net\" />\n\n[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]\nBecause of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].\n\nReshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.\n\nIn 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname \"Cream City\", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.\n\n[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.\n\nAlong with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919\u20131922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Brewing===\n{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents.

With the election of Mayor [[John Norquist|John O. Norquist]] in 1988, the city adopted a cabinet form of government with the mayor appointing those department heads not otherwise elected or appointed\u2014notably the Fire and Police Chiefs. While this gave the mayor greater control of the day-to-day operations of the city, the Common Council retains almost complete control over the city's finances and the mayor, with the exception of his proposed annual budget, cannot directly introduce legislation. The Common Council consists of 15 members, one from each district in the city. Milwaukee has a history of giving long tenures to its mayors; from [[Frank Zeidler]] to current mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the city has had only four mayors in the last 60 years. When 28-year incumbent [[Henry Maier]] retired in 1988, he held the record for longest term of service for a city of Milwaukee's size.\n\nIn addition to the election of a Mayor and Common Council on the city level, Milwaukee residents elect county representatives to the [[Milwaukee County]] [[Board of Supervisors]], as well as a Milwaukee County Executive. The current [[County Executive]] is [[Chris Abele]].\n\nMilwaukee has been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold for more than a century at the federal level.<ref>{{cite web |last1=O\u2019Neill |first1=Joseph |title=How Milwaukee Could Decide the Next President |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-wins-wisconsin-milwaukee-community-organizing?source=EDT_NYR_EDIT_NEWSLETTER_0_imagenewsletter_Daily_ZZ&bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369&esrc=&mbid= |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=19 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> At the local level, [[Socialist Party of America|Socialists]] frequently won the mayorship and (for briefer periods) other city and county offices during much of the first sixty years of the 20th century.

He kept goal for Arsenal in the [[1927 FA Cup Final]] where a mistake by him saw [[Cardiff City]] win the cup.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Maerdy]], [[Glamorgan]], Lewis first played for local clubs, before moving to [[London]] and joining [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]]. His move to the big time came in 1924 when he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] Arsenal. He made his debut for the Gunners on 15 November 1924 against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]; Arsenal won 3\u20132 and Lewis remained for the next thirteen games. However, after letting in five in a match at home to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 14 February 1925, Lewis was dropped.\n\nAfter [[Herbert Chapman]] arrived as Arsenal manager in 1925, Lewis shared goalkeeping duties with [[Jock Robson]] and [[Bill Harper (footballer, born 1897)|Bill Harper]], but Lewis gradually became the club's No. 1, particularly after Robson and Harper left in 1926 and 1927 respectively. He won his first cap for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in a 3\u20133 draw against [[England national football team|England]] on 12 February 1927. In all he won three caps, the last of which was a 6\u20130 defeat by England at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 20 November 1929.\n\nLewis was the Arsenal goalkeeper in the [[FA Cup Final 1927|1927 FA Cup Final]] against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]; it was the Gunners' first Cup final. In the 74th minute, Cardiff [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Hughie Ferguson]] hit a tame shot straight at Lewis, who dived down to make what should have been a comfortable save. However, Lewis fumbled the ball as he gathered it, and it slipped between his body and the crook of his elbow; Lewis turned around and tried in vain to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it with his elbow into the back of the net. Cardiff won the match 1\u20130, the only time a Welsh club has won the FA Cup. Lewis blamed his brand new [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] for the error, saying the wool was too greasy for him to grip the ball properly; since then, according to club legend, no Arsenal goalkeeper has played in a new jersey before it is washed first.<ref>http://www.goalkeepersaredifferent.com/keepers/getting-shirty.html</ref>\n\nLewis continued to play as Arsenal's regular goalkeeper for the next three seasons. However, when they reached Wembley for their second Cup final in 1930, Lewis was injured and had major surgery on a knee. He never fully recovered from this which effectively finished his football career. Arsenal beat Huddersfield 2\u20130 to claim their first major trophy. Lewis hardly featured at all the following season, particularly after the signings of Bill Harper (for a second spell) and [[Gerard Keizer]].

He kept goal for Arsenal in the [[1927 FA Cup Final]] where a mistake by him saw [[Cardiff City]] win the cup.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Maerdy]], [[Glamorgan]], Lewis first played for local clubs, before moving to [[London]] and joining [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]]. His move to the big time came in 1924 when he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] Arsenal. He made his debut for the Gunners on 15 November 1924 against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]; Arsenal won 3\u20132 and Lewis remained for the next thirteen games. However, after letting in five in a match at home to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 14 February 1925, Lewis was dropped.\n\nAfter [[Herbert Chapman]] arrived as Arsenal manager in 1925, Lewis shared goalkeeping duties with [[Jock Robson]] and [[Bill Harper (footballer, born 1897)|Bill Harper]], but Lewis gradually became the club's No. 1, particularly after Robson and Harper left in 1926 and 1927 respectively. He won his first cap for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in a 3\u20133 draw against [[England national football team|England]] on 12 February 1927. In all he won three caps, the last of which was a 6\u20130 defeat by England at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 20 November 1929.\n\nLewis was the Arsenal goalkeeper in the [[FA Cup Final 1927|1927 FA Cup Final]] against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]; it was the Gunners' first Cup final. In the 74th minute, Cardiff [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Hughie Ferguson]] hit a tame shot straight at Lewis, who dived down to make what should have been a comfortable save. However, Lewis fumbled the ball as he gathered it, and it slipped between his body and the crook of his elbow; Lewis turned around and tried in vain to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it with his elbow into the back of the net. Cardiff won the match 1\u20130, the only time a Welsh club has won the FA Cup. Lewis blamed his brand new [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] for the error, saying the wool was too greasy for him to grip the ball properly; since then, according to club legend, no Arsenal goalkeeper has played in a new jersey before it is washed first.<ref>http://www.goalkeepersaredifferent.com/keepers/getting-shirty.html</ref>\n\nLewis continued to play as Arsenal's regular goalkeeper for the next three seasons. However, when they reached Wembley for their second Cup final in 1930, Lewis was injured and had major surgery on a knee. He never fully recovered from this which effectively finished his football career. Arsenal beat Huddersfield 2\u20130 to claim their first major trophy. Lewis hardly featured at all the following season, particularly after the signings of Bill Harper (for a second spell) and [[Gerard Keizer]]. He was transferred to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in May 1931. In all he played 169 matches for Arsenal.\n\nLewis played only six times for Gillingham and apparently retired from professional football soon after. He died in 1965, at the age of 62.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===As a player===\n;Arsenal\n\n*[[FA Cup]] finalist \u2013 [[FA Cup Final 1927|1927]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book |\n   last=Harris|first=Jeff|editor-last=Hogg|editor-first=Tony |\n   title=Arsenal Who's Who |\n   publisher=Independent UK Sports |\n   year=1995 |\n   isbn=1-899429-03-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060426215553/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/walesonair/database/facup.shtml BBC Wales on Air - 1927 FA Cup Final], with video footage of Lewis's error.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lewis, Dan}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1965 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Rhondda]]\n[[Category:Welsh footballers]]\n[[Category:Association football goalkeepers]]\n[[Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Arsenal F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Gillingham F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Wales international footballers]]\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Lewis_(footballer)"}

They defeated {{cbb link|1992|sex=men|team=Coastal Carolina Chanticleers|school=Coastal Carolina University|title=Coastal Carolina}} in their first game and then were taken to overtime by #9 seed [[1992\u201393 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] before escaping with a victory.\n\nThe Wolverines moved on to the [[Kingdome]] for the regionals. The sub-regional had been littered with upsets, as the #12, #13, and #15 seeds had all won in the first round. Michigan drew #12 seeded {{cbb link|1992|sex=men|team=George Washington Colonials|school=George Washington University|title=George Washington}} and won, then faced {{cbb link|1992|sex=men|team=Temple Owls|school=Temple University|title=Temple}} for the second consecutive year (having defeated them as a #6 seed the year before) and beating them 77&ndash;72 to join [[1992-93 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], [[1992-93 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], and [[1992-93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the Final Four in [[New Orleans]].\nIn their national semifinal at the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] on April 3, the team defeated Southeast Regional winner [[1992\u201393 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] 81&ndash;78 in overtime.\n\nIn the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] at the Superdome on April 5, the Wolverines lost to East Regional winner [[1992\u201393 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] 77&ndash;71. Michigan's final possession of the game went down as one of the most memorable moments in college basketball history. With twenty seconds to go and Michigan trailing by two and out of timeouts, Chris Webber rebounded a missed free throw. Confused as to what to do next, Webber thought about passing to Jalen Rose but did not and took a step without dribbling the basketball. The officials did not see the travel, however, and Webber headed upcourt where North Carolina was set up in a half court trap defense. Webber ran directly into the trap and was double teamed in the corner. He could not break the double team to pass the ball, and called for a timeout that the Wolverines did not have. By rule, Michigan was given a technical foul for calling the extra timeout and North Carolina was given two free throws and possession of the ball. North Carolina made their free throws, then added two more when Michigan was forced to foul again after the change in possession.<ref name=UMNCAA3/><ref name=TTY45/>\n\nThe team established numerous NCAA records for [[three-point field goal]]s in the [[final four]]: fewest single-game three-point field goals made in a final four (0 vs. [[1992\u201393 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] on April 3, 1993, in an [[overtime (sports)|overtime]]) and fewest single-game three-point field goals attempted (4 vs. Kentucky).<ref name=TFF10>{{cite

three-point field goals made surpassed the team's previous record of 1 made against [[1991\u201392 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] the year before in the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]].<ref name=TFF10/>\n\n==Later developments==\nIn 2002, the Wolverines vacated their entire 1992\u201393 season, including their tournament appearance, in the wake of a [[University of Michigan basketball scandal|major scandal]] involving many years of improper payments from a major booster to several former players, among them Webber.\n\n==Statistics==\nThe team

They defeated {{cbb link|1992|sex=men|team=Coastal Carolina Chanticleers|school=Coastal Carolina University|title=Coastal Carolina}} in their first game and then were taken to overtime by #9 seed [[1992\u201393 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] before escaping with a victory.\n\nThe Wolverines moved on to the [[Kingdome]] for the regionals. The sub-regional had been littered with upsets, as the #12, #13, and #15 seeds had all won in the first round. Michigan drew #12 seeded {{cbb link|1992|sex=men|team=George Washington Colonials|school=George Washington University|title=George Washington}} and won, then faced {{cbb link|1992|sex=men|team=Temple Owls|school=Temple University|title=Temple}} for the second consecutive year (having defeated them as a #6 seed the year before) and beating them 77&ndash;72 to join [[1992-93 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], [[1992-93 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], and [[1992-93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the Final Four in [[New Orleans]].\nIn their national semifinal at the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] on April 3, the team defeated Southeast Regional winner [[1992\u201393 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] 81&ndash;78 in overtime.\n\nIn the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] at the Superdome on April 5, the Wolverines lost to East Regional winner [[1992\u201393 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] 77&ndash;71. Michigan's final possession of the game went down as one of the most memorable moments in college basketball history. With twenty seconds to go and Michigan trailing by two and out of timeouts, Chris Webber rebounded a missed free throw. Confused as to what to do next, Webber thought about passing to Jalen Rose but did not and took a step without dribbling the basketball. The officials did not see the travel, however, and Webber headed upcourt where North Carolina was set up in a half court trap defense. Webber ran directly into the trap and was double teamed in the corner. He could not break the double team to pass the ball, and called for a timeout that the Wolverines did not have. By rule, Michigan was given a technical foul for calling the extra timeout and North Carolina was given two free throws and possession of the ball. North Carolina made their free throws, then added two more when Michigan was forced to foul again after the change in possession.<ref name=UMNCAA3/><ref name=TTY45/>\n\nThe team established numerous NCAA records for [[three-point field goal]]s in the [[final four]]: fewest single-game three-point field goals made in a final four (0 vs. [[1992\u201393 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball

His 284 league goals remains a record at the club.\n\nIn 1925, he moved to [[Football League First Division]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and continued his scoring exploits, including scoring the winning goals in the [[1927 FA Cup Final]], in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and the [[1927 FA Charity Shield]], in a 2\u20131 victory over amateur side [[Corinthians F.C.|Corinthians]], making Cardiff the only non-English team to have ever won the [[FA Cup]] or the [[FA Charity Shield]].

He appeared for the side in their victorious 1914\u201315 [[Scottish Junior Cup]] final.\n\n===Motherwell===\nFerguson joined [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John Hunter]]'s [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] for the start of the 1916\u201317 season, scoring both goals in the 2\u20132 draw with [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] on 19 August 1916. He soon established himself as a prolific goalscorer at [[Fir Park]], becoming the top [[Scottish Football League]] goalscorer on three occasions (1917\u201318; 1919\u201320; 1920\u201321), scoring 111 goals in total. His 43 goals in 1921 is the second highest season total of League goals in England or Scotland before the change to the [[Offside (association football)|offside law]] in 1925.
