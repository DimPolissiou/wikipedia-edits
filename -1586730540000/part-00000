The magazine presents essays, poetry, fiction, interviews, and book reviews from all over the world in a format accessible to a broad audience. Its mission is to serve as an engaging, informative index to contemporary international literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Literature Today {{!}} Mission|url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/mission|publisher=World Literature Today|date=2011-11-21}}</ref>  It was founded as '''''Books Abroad''''' in 1927 by Roy Temple House, chair of the Department of Modern Languages at the University of Oklahoma. In January 1977, the journal assumed its present name, ''World Literature Today''.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Literature Today {{!}}History|url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/history|publisher=World Literature Today|date=2011-11-21}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of ''World Literature Today'' is a story of men and women of letters deeply committed to advancing the cause of literature, art, and culture.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A.

The 1980 Nobel Laureate and 1978 [[Neustadt Prize]] winner [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]] once declared, \"If ''WLT'' were not in existence, we would have to invent it. It fulfills the unique role of bringing information about works little known or inaccessible in English-speaking countries.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mi\u0142osz|first=Czes\u0142aw|title=Homages|journal=Books Abroad|date=Autumn 1976|volume=50|issue=4|pages=752|jstor=40130981|doi=10.2307/40130981}}</ref>\n\nThe journal publishes articles, book reviews, and other features, while its offices function as a humanities center for a variety of cultural activities, as the magazine staff organizes conferences and symposia (see [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]]), bestows literary prizes (see [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] and [[NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature]]), and encourages the work of students, scholars, researchers, and readers of world literature everywhere. Devoted to the presentation and discussion of current literature in major and lesser-known languages of the world, ''WLT'' is the only international magazine focused on comprehensive and informative coverage of developments in contemporary literatures worldwide. ''WLT'' frequently represents the sole source available anywhere for information on the less familiar\u2014often unjustly overlooked\u2014literary traditions of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A. Genova|title=Twayne Companion to Contemporary World Literature|year=2003|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8057-1700-6|pages=1600}}</ref>\n\nRoy Temple House's driving idea for the original publication came from his desire to offer non-ideological commentary on a variety of literatures to counter what he saw as America's dangerous trend toward isolationism in the 1920s. House hoped to promote more extensive and more thoughtful international understanding through the communication of a variety of opinions on art, literature, and ideas. As he wrote in the first issue of ''Books Abroad'', he was aware of the difficulties of his new enterprise, of the looming challenges and obstacles, but he could also clearly sense the satisfaction and rewards the future would bring:\n\n<blockquote>[The editors] are undertaking to distribute four times a year a little magazine of really useful information concerning the more important book publications of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, the South American republics, and perhaps other countries. [The editors] are hard-worked modern language teachers in a modest institution, without the leisure, the equipment, or the experience to do this work as well and thoroughly as they wish it might be done. They will be criticized for their omissions and inclusions, for their lack of a hard and fast plan as to just what types of books shall be treated and what types left to other publications, for the amateurish character of some of their matter, for the opportunism which fully expects to change their policy here and there as circumstances may demand it. They offer their first number with fear and trembling, but with the conviction that they are undertaking a work which very much needed doing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=House|first=Roy Temple|title=Foreword to Our First Issue|journal=Books Abroad|date=January 1927|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1\u20132|jstor=40043173}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nIn the recounting of the lore surrounding ''Books Abroad'', colorful tales associated with the frequent visits of literary celebrities who traveled to the University of Oklahoma campus under the auspices of the journal's affiliated programs (see [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]], for example) arise.  One case in point involves [[Michel Butor]], the celebrated French author and critic, who was the featured writer at the 1981 [[Puterbaugh Conference]]; he had already established a productive history with the [[University of Oklahoma]] as he had lectured on the university's campus in 1971 and had served as a juror for the [[Neustadt Prize]] in 1974 (the candidate he championed, [[Francis Ponge]], won the award that year). During the 1981 visit, Butor gave seminars and delivered lectures on such topics as \"Literature and Dream\" and \"The Origin of the Text,\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Butor|first=Michel|title=The Origin of the Text|journal=World Literature Today|date=Spring 1982|volume=56|issue=2|pages=207\u2013208, 210, 212\u2013215|jstor=40137506|doi=10.2307/40137506}}</ref>  but perhaps the most memorable Butor text connected to his visit was the poem he wrote, adapted from the French by [[Ivar Ivask]], entitled \"An Evening in Norman,\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Butor|first=Michel|title=Le Soir \u00e0 Norman/An Evening in Norman|journal=World Literature Today|date=Spring 1982|volume=56|issue=2|pages=199\u2013201|jstor=40137504|doi=10.2307/40137504}}</ref>  of which the first stanza reads: \"My window faces west just as it does in Nice / where it's deep night now / the rays of the moon's first quarter / illuminate the sky both here and there.\"\n\nFor ''Books Abroad'', House and his editors began their work, a genuine labor of love, for no extra compensation or release time from their duties as university professors. Even the initial production costs were paid for from their own pockets. In 1931, these costs became more onerous, and the editors imposed a subscription rate\u2014an amount charming to nostalgic readers and editors of today\u2014of one dollar per year, though the editorial staff still received no extra salary.\n\n[[File:WLT Ship Logo.jpg|thumb|The original WLT logo]]House devised as the journal's Latin motto \"Lux a Peregre,\" which can be translated as \"Light from Abroad,\" or \"Light of Discovery.\" The phrase accompanied the original logo, also conceived by House, of a full-rigged ship, a rich image which calls to mind not only adventure, as in venturing out toward unknown horizons, but also evokes harbor and beacon, as the academic community and university institution are perceived as a safe haven for the journal's daily operation. In 1927 the quarterly began as a short publication of 32 pages. By its fiftieth year, ''Books Abroad'' had grown to more than 250 pages. In 2006 ''WLT'' switched from quarterly to bimonthly publication. It is one of the oldest continuously published literary periodicals in the United States, along with such other publications launched in the early twentieth century as ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' (1902), ''[[Poetry (magazine)]]'' (1912), and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (1925).\n\nAt its origins, the publication was democratic in its selection criteria regarding books to review, even excessively so, and for the first years every kind of publication\u2014from entomological studies and naval histories to grammar books and reissued classics\u2014was reviewed in its pages. Soon a clearer, more sophisticated focus on literary works per se was formulated, as the editors opened the frontiers of their publication to a broader geographical and cultural scope, expanding the parameters of the journal significantly to include reviews and articles addressing the work of non-European writers. House also encouraged the inclusion of features of more popular style and wider appeal, as with the surveys of celebrated writers on questions of general cultural interest and a variety of symposium topics, such as the 1932 discussion, the first of many more to come, on the Nobel Prize. Related topics for symposia included \"Transplanted Writers,\" \"Women Playwrights,\" \"Foster-Mother Tongue,\" and \"Can't Book Reviewers Be Honest?\" By the early 1930s, such celebrated authors as [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[H. L. Mencken]], [[Upton Sinclair]], and [[Henry Van Dyke]] were publishing critical texts in ''Books Abroad''.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A. Genova|title=Twayne Companion to Contemporary World Literature|year=2003|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8057-1700-6|pages=1600}}</ref>\n\nHouse served as editor from 1927 until his retirement in 1949 and was succeeded by the German critic and novelist [[Ernst Erich Noth]], who went on to edit the journal for ten productive and formative years. As a European-born writer and editor, Noth was the first of a series of cosmopolitan, foreign-born intellectuals who would continue to lead the journal's editorial staff for more than forty years. One of Noth's major contributions to the ongoing process of establishing a distinctive identity for the quarterly was the move to narrow the editorial scope to focus solely on writers of the twentieth century, and to review only books that had been published no more than two years earlier. He also introduced a new feature, \"Periodicals in Review\" (sometimes appearing as \"Periodicals at Large\"), which surveyed the policies and initiatives of a number of literary journals from Europe, the Americas, and throughout the world.\n\nIn 1959, Noth was succeeded by [[Wolfgang Bernard Fleischmann]], a Viennese-born scholar who directed the quarterly for two years. His major contribution to the development of Books Abroad was the publication of a continuing symposium on twentieth-century poetry from the Western world. He was followed in 1961 by the Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 Robert Vlach, who had been appointed as a professor in the Department of Modern Languages at the University of Oklahoma. Vlach established a new review section in the journal devoted to Slavic languages, and he also initiated the ''Books Abroad'' symposia which took place at the annual convention of the [[Modern Language Association]]. After Vlach's death in 1966, Assistant Editor [[Bernice Duncan]] carried on with noted success until [[Ivar Ivask]] became editor in 1967.  In 1977, a truly significant initiative was reflected in the change of name from ''Books Abroad'' to ''World Literature Today'', a title that suggests both global and contemporary reflections on a diversity of literary forms and transcends the more limited implications of the former title, which could be interpreted as excessively Eurocentric.\n\nIn 1999, the current executive director at the journal, [[Robert Con Davis-Undiano]], Professor of English at the University of Oklahoma, came to ''WLT'', and was named the Neustadt Professor of Comparative Literature. Today, Davis-Undiano collaborates with the current editorial staff, Daniel Simon (editor in chief, who has been with ''WLT'' since 2002), Michelle Johnson (managing editor), and Rob Vollmar (book review editor), and has worked to enact many modifications\u2014including new directions in magazine content and design\u2014that are among the most significant in the history of the journal.\n\n==Sponsored pfrizes and estivals==\n''WLT'' also sponsors the biennial [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], the [[NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature]], and the annual [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]].\n\n===Neustadt International Prize for Literature===\nThe [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] was launched in 1969 under Ivask.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/blog/once-over/1969-neustadt-prize-charter|title=The 1969 Neustadt Prize Charter|date=2019-09-13|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> This biennial award, which brought an original purse of $10,000 and currently bestows $50,000, is supported by an endowment through the [[University of Oklahoma]], from the Oklahoma- and Texas-based Neustadt family. The Neustadt Prize was the first international prize for literature of this scope to originate in the United States, and it remains one of the very few literary prizes on an international scale for which novelists, playwrights, and poets are equally eligible (the only stipulation dictates that at least a representative portion of the author's work must be available in English). Each Neustadt Prize winner is selected by a different jury, chosen by the executive director (who is the only permanent member) in consultation with the journal's editors and the president of the University of Oklahoma. Each juror nominates one author, and all nominations are made public several months before the jury convenes on the campus in the fall of odd-numbered years. The group meets for one to two days behind closed doors, and the laureate then receives the award at a banquet the following year. Also, a special section of the journal is subsequently devoted to that author's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neustadt International Prize for Literature|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/neustadt-prize.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>\n\nAn overview of the twenty-five Prizes awarded to date includes the esteemed group of winners selected over the past thirty years: [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] (1970, Italy), [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1972, Colombia), [[Francis Ponge]] (1974, France), [[Elizabeth Bishop]] (1976, USA), [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]] (1978, Poland), [[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]] (1980, Czechoslovakia/Canada), [[Octavio Paz]] (1982, Mexico), [[Paavo Haavikko]] (1984, Finland), [[Max Frisch]] (1986, Switzerland), [[Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer]] (1990, Sweden), [[Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto]] (1992, Brazil), [[Kamau Brathwaite]] (1994, Barbados), [[Assia Djebar]] (1996, Algeria), [[Nuruddin Farah]] (1998, Somalia), [[David Malouf]] (2000, Australia), [[\u00c1lvaro Mutis]] (2002, Colombia), [[Adam Zagajewski]] (2004, Poland), [[Claribel Alegr\u00eda]] (2006, Nicaragua/El Salvador) [[Patricia Grace]] (2008, New Zealand), [[Duo Duo]] (2010, China), and [[Rohinton Mistry]] (2012, India/Canada), Mia Couto (2014, Mozambique), Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107 (2016, transnational), Edwidge Danticat (2018, Haiti), and Ismail Kadare (2020, Albania).<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Laureates of the Neustadt International Prize for Literature|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/past-laureates.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>  In 2009 the week's events were renamed the [[Neustadt Festival of International Literature and Culture]]. During the festivals, ''WLT'' celebrates the culture and achievements of the Neustadt laureate or features readings by the Neustadt jurors, which allows students from the [[University of Oklahoma]] and the [[Norman, OK]] community to interact with world-class writers.\n\n===Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture===\nThe second major event associated with ''WLT'' is the [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]], sponsored by the journal in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma Departments of English and Modern Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics. The Puterbaugh series of conferences began in 1968 and was originally named the Oklahoma Conference on Writers of the Hispanic World. It was endowed in perpetuity in 1978 by the Puterbaugh Foundation of McAlester, Oklahoma. In that year, the scope of the conference was expanded to include writers of the French-speaking world, as well as from Spain and Spanish America.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggan|first=William S.|title=The Puterbaugh Conferences|journal=Sooner Magazine|date=Summer 1983|volume=3|issue=4|pages=26\u201331|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p26-31_1983v3n4_OCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, all restrictions were removed, and, since that date, all living writers have been potentially eligible for the honor. The Puterbaugh Festival brings a prominent author to the Norman campus for approximately one week, during which he or she visits classes, gives public lectures and readings, and is honored by a symposium featuring scholars and specialists who discuss the author's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Puterbaugh Tradition at the University of Oklahoma|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/puterbaugh-festival.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>  The list of those who have been featured in the Puterbaugh Festival includes highly visible writers honored (some of whom have also won the Neustadt Prize): [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]] (1968, Spain), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1969, Argentina), [[Octavio Paz]] (1971, Mexico), [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]] (1973, Spain), [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] (1975, Argentina), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (1977, Peru), [[Yves Bonnefoy]] (1979, France), [[Michel Butor]] (1981, France), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (1983, Mexico), [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]] (1987, Cuba), [[Edouard Glissant]] (1989, Martinique), [[Manuel Puig]] (1991, Argentina), [[Maryse Cond\u00e9]] (1993, Guadeloupe), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (1995, Argentina), [[J.M.G.

The award\u2014made possible through the generosity of Nancy Barcelo, Susan Neustadt Schwartz, and Kathy Neustadt, the three daughters of Walter Jr. and Dolores Neustadt\u2014is awarded every other year to a living writer with significant achievement. Laureates receive a check for $35,000, a silver medallion, and a certificate at a public ceremony at the University of Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web|title=NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/nsk-childrens-prize.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>\n\nTo date, the winners of the NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since the inception of ''Books Abroad'', the series of editors associated with the journal has encouraged lively debate about the annual announcement of the Nobel Prize, as with the 1940 \"Super-Nobel\" election sponsored in ''Books Abroad'', in which contributors and other specialists were invited to choose the writer who they felt had offered the most significant contribution to world literature in the first third of the twentieth century, whether or not that writer had won the Nobel Prize. At the top of the \"Super-Nobel\" list were several non-Nobel winners, such as [[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Theodore Dreiser]], but the award went to [[Thomas Mann]], who had, in fact, won the Nobel in 1929 and who became a frequent contributor to ''Books Abroad''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggan|first=William|title=The Nobel Connection|journal=Sooner Magazine|date=Spring 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16\u201317|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p16-20_1981v1n1_OCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, ''WLT'' founding editor Roy Temple House was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  The South Central Modern Language Association held its annual meeting in Norman, Oklahoma in October of that year, and the membership formally endorsed Professor House for the prize on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Daniel|title=Editor's Note|journal=World Literature Today|date=May 2015|volume=89|issue=3|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2015/may/editors-note-may-2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, ''Books Abroad'' often featured the topic of the Nobel Prize, as with the series of symposia published periodically in the journal: \"Prodding the Nobel Prize Committee\" (1932), \"Nominations for the Nobel Prize for Literature\" (1935), \"Books Abroad's Super-Nobel Election\" (1940), \"What's Wrong with the Nobel Prize?\" (1951),  and \"Nobel Prize Symposium\" (1967). In these symposia, critics, scholars, and authors discussed the policies and procedures of the Swedish Academy as well as the very secretive selection process and the sometimes-curious choices of winners for a literary prize (such as Winston Churchill, the 1953 laureate, and Bertrand Russell, the 1951 laureate).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggan|first=William|title=The Nobel Connection|journal=Sooner Magazine|date=Spring 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17\u201318|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p16-20_1981v1n1_OCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Spring 1981 issue of ''WLT'' was devoted entirely to the presentation of the members of the Swedish academy, many of whom were successful creative writers in their own right. In 1951 the Nobel Foundation chose the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] to issue the first English-language edition of its own authoritative volume, entitled ''Nobel: The Man and His Prizes''. Also, the often-synchronistic relationship between the Neustadt Prize, once described by the ''New York Times'' as the \"Oklahoma 'Nobel'\" (February 1982),<ref>{{cite news|last=McDOWELL|first=Edwin|title=PUBLISHING: The Oklahoma 'Nobel'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/26/books/publishing-the-oklahoma-nobel.html?scp=1&sq=Oklahoma+Nobel+Neustadt&st=nyt|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 26, 1982}}</ref> and the Nobel Prize itself is demonstrated in the number of convergences. Between 1970 and 2016, thirty-two writers affiliated with the Neustadt Prize (as jurors, candidates, or winners) went on to receive the Nobel after their association with the Neustadt, including [[Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer]], the 1990 Neustadt laureate and 2011 Nobel laureate.\n\n==Recent history==\n\nIn late 2000, the editors worked with forty scholars to establish a list of the \"Most Important Works in World Literature, 1927-2001,\" a project organized and timed to help celebrate ''WLT'''s seventy-fifth year of uninterrupted publication.  The top 40 list was chosen by specialists, but with the nonspecialist in mind, with the intention of inviting response and debate among readers and writers.\nFurther, a forum for readers' correspondence was also initiated in 2000.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A. Genova|title=Twayne Companion to Contemporary World Literature|year=2003|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8057-1700-6|pages=xxi}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, with its combination of award-winning editing and design along with special sections on broad contemporary topics like Belief in an Age of Intolerance, Speculative Fiction, and Literary Activism, ''WLT'' functions as a hybrid academic/creative magazine to chronicle and interpret the most current developments in world literature\u2014topics generally outside the purview of purely academic journals or popular magazines.\n\n=== What to Read Now ===\nWLT invites prominent writers from different regions of the world to be guest editors of the popular column \"What to Read Now\". The writers select the most relevant and timely books on a genre, country, cultural theme, or political topic, such as the Puerto Rican poet [[Giannina Braschi]] on \"What to Read Now: Mixed-Genre Literature\" or the London-based Zimbabwean novelist [[Brian Chikwava]] on \"What to Read Now: Zimbabwe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=World Literature Today |url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2012/september/what-read-now-mixed-genre-literature-giannina-braschi|publisher=World Literature Today|date=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Articles style ===\nIn \"Back to the Essay: World Literature Today in the Twenty-First Century,\" Davis-Undiano  argued for a move away from the stilted academic style of the scholarly article, favoring instead the more creative, experimental, and unrestrained form of the essay. He explains:\n\n<blockquote>The essay tradition is not a prescriptive one of writing in a certain mold, but a capacious one defined mainly by a strategy for maintaining effective ties among writing form, the material being discussed, and the intended audience. Essays in the main tradition tend to have a definable perspective, even on occasion a personal one, and they speak in an idiom that reaches a broad audience.

The 1980 Nobel Laureate and 1978 [[Neustadt Prize]] winner [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]] once declared, \"If ''WLT'' were not in existence, we would have to invent it. It fulfills the unique role of bringing information about works little known or inaccessible in English-speaking countries.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mi\u0142osz|first=Czes\u0142aw|title=Homages|journal=Books Abroad|date=Autumn 1976|volume=50|issue=4|pages=752|jstor=40130981|doi=10.2307/40130981}}</ref>\n\nThe journal publishes articles, book reviews, and other features, while its offices function as a humanities center for a variety of cultural activities, as the magazine staff organizes conferences and symposia (see [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]]), bestows literary prizes (see [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] and [[NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature]]), and encourages the work of students, scholars, researchers, and readers of world literature everywhere. Devoted to the presentation and discussion of current literature in major and lesser-known languages of the world, ''WLT'' is the only international magazine focused on comprehensive and informative coverage of developments in contemporary literatures worldwide. ''WLT'' frequently represents the sole source available anywhere for information on the less familiar\u2014often unjustly overlooked\u2014literary traditions of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A.

House hoped to promote more extensive and more thoughtful international understanding through the communication of a variety of opinions on art, literature, and ideas. As he wrote in the first issue of ''Books Abroad'', he was aware of the difficulties of his new enterprise, of the looming challenges and obstacles, but he could also clearly sense the satisfaction and rewards the future would bring:\n\n<blockquote>[The editors] are undertaking to distribute four times a year a little magazine of really useful information concerning the more important book publications of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, the South American republics, and perhaps other countries. [The editors] are hard-worked modern language teachers in a modest institution, without the leisure, the equipment, or the experience to do this work as well and thoroughly as they wish it might be done. They will be criticized for their omissions and inclusions, for their lack of a hard and fast plan as to just what types of books shall be treated and what types left to other publications, for the amateurish character of some of their matter, for the opportunism which fully expects to change their policy here and there as circumstances may demand it. They offer their first number with fear and trembling, but with the conviction that they are undertaking a work which very much needed doing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=House|first=Roy Temple|title=Foreword to Our First Issue|journal=Books Abroad|date=January 1927|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1\u20132|jstor=40043173}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nIn the recounting of the lore surrounding ''Books Abroad'', colorful tales associated with the frequent visits of literary celebrities who traveled to the University of Oklahoma campus under the auspices of the journal's affiliated programs (see [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]], for example) arise.  One case in point involves [[Michel Butor]], the celebrated French author and critic, who was the featured writer at the 1981 [[Puterbaugh Conference]]; he had already established a productive history with the [[University of Oklahoma]] as he had lectured on the university's campus in 1971 and had served as a juror for the [[Neustadt Prize]] in 1974 (the candidate he championed, [[Francis Ponge]], won the award that year). During the 1981 visit, Butor gave seminars and delivered lectures on such topics as \"Literature and Dream\" and \"The Origin of the Text,\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Butor|first=Michel|title=The Origin of the Text|journal=World Literature Today|date=Spring 1982|volume=56|issue=2|pages=207\u2013208, 210, 212\u2013215|jstor=40137506|doi=10.2307/40137506}}</ref>  but perhaps the most memorable Butor text connected to his visit was the poem he wrote, adapted from the French by [[Ivar Ivask]], entitled \"An Evening in Norman,\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Butor|first=Michel|title=Le Soir \u00e0 Norman/An Evening in Norman|journal=World Literature Today|date=Spring 1982|volume=56|issue=2|pages=199\u2013201|jstor=40137504|doi=10.2307/40137504}}</ref>  of which the first stanza reads: \"My window faces west just as it does in Nice / where it's deep night now / the rays of the moon's first quarter / illuminate the sky both here and there.\"\n\nFor ''Books Abroad'', House and his editors began their work, a genuine labor of love, for no extra compensation or release time from their duties as university professors. Even the initial production costs were paid for from their own pockets. In 1931, these costs became more onerous, and the editors imposed a subscription rate\u2014an amount charming to nostalgic readers and editors of today\u2014of one dollar per year, though the editorial staff still received no extra salary.\n\n[[File:WLT Ship Logo.jpg|thumb|The original WLT logo]]House devised as the journal's Latin motto \"Lux a Peregre,\" which can be translated as \"Light from Abroad,\" or \"Light of Discovery.\" The phrase accompanied the original logo, also conceived by House, of a full-rigged ship, a rich image which calls to mind not only adventure, as in venturing out toward unknown horizons, but also evokes harbor and beacon, as the academic community and university institution are perceived as a safe haven for the journal's daily operation. In 1927 the quarterly began as a short publication of 32 pages. By its fiftieth year, ''Books Abroad'' had grown to more than 250 pages. In 2006 ''WLT'' switched from quarterly to bimonthly publication. It is one of the oldest continuously published literary periodicals in the United States, along with such other publications launched in the early twentieth century as ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' (1902), ''[[Poetry (magazine)]]'' (1912), and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (1925).\n\nAt its origins, the publication was democratic in its selection criteria regarding books to review, even excessively so, and for the first years every kind of publication\u2014from entomological studies and naval histories to grammar books and reissued classics\u2014was reviewed in its pages. Soon a clearer, more sophisticated focus on literary works per se was formulated, as the editors opened the frontiers of their publication to a broader geographical and cultural scope, expanding the parameters of the journal significantly to include reviews and articles addressing the work of non-European writers. House also encouraged the inclusion of features of more popular style and wider appeal, as with the surveys of celebrated writers on questions of general cultural interest and a variety of symposium topics, such as the 1932 discussion, the first of many more to come, on the Nobel Prize. Related topics for symposia included \"Transplanted Writers,\" \"Women Playwrights,\" \"Foster-Mother Tongue,\" and \"Can't Book Reviewers Be Honest?\" By the early 1930s, such celebrated authors as [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[H. L. Mencken]], [[Upton Sinclair]], and [[Henry Van Dyke]] were publishing critical texts in ''Books Abroad''.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A. Genova|title=Twayne Companion to Contemporary World Literature|year=2003|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8057-1700-6|pages=1600}}</ref>\n\nHouse served as editor from 1927 until his retirement in 1949 and was succeeded by the German critic and novelist [[Ernst Erich Noth]], who went on to edit the journal for ten productive and formative years. As a European-born writer and editor, Noth was the first of a series of cosmopolitan, foreign-born intellectuals who would continue to lead the journal's editorial staff for more than forty years. One of Noth's major contributions to the ongoing process of establishing a distinctive identity for the quarterly was the move to narrow the editorial scope to focus solely on writers of the twentieth century, and to review only books that had been published no more than two years earlier. He also introduced a new feature, \"Periodicals in Review\" (sometimes appearing as \"Periodicals at Large\"), which surveyed the policies and initiatives of a number of literary journals from Europe, the Americas, and throughout the world.\n\nIn 1959, Noth was succeeded by [[Wolfgang Bernard Fleischmann]], a Viennese-born scholar who directed the quarterly for two years. His major contribution to the development of Books Abroad was the publication of a continuing symposium on twentieth-century poetry from the Western world. He was followed in 1961 by the Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 Robert Vlach, who had been appointed as a professor in the Department of Modern Languages at the University of Oklahoma. Vlach established a new review section in the journal devoted to Slavic languages, and he also initiated the ''Books Abroad'' symposia which took place at the annual convention of the [[Modern Language Association]]. After Vlach's death in 1966, Assistant Editor [[Bernice Duncan]] carried on with noted success until [[Ivar Ivask]] became editor in 1967.  In 1977, a truly significant initiative was reflected in the change of name from ''Books Abroad'' to ''World Literature Today'', a title that suggests both global and contemporary reflections on a diversity of literary forms and transcends the more limited implications of the former title, which could be interpreted as excessively Eurocentric.\n\nIn 1999, the current executive director at the journal, [[Robert Con Davis-Undiano]], Professor of English at the University of Oklahoma, came to ''WLT'', and was named the Neustadt Professor of Comparative Literature. Today, Davis-Undiano collaborates with the current editorial staff, Daniel Simon (editor in chief, who has been with ''WLT'' since 2002), Michelle Johnson (managing editor), and Rob Vollmar (book review editor), and has worked to enact many modifications\u2014including new directions in magazine content and design\u2014that are among the most significant in the history of the journal.\n\n==Sponsored pfrizes and estivals==\n''WLT'' also sponsors the biennial [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], the [[NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature]], and the annual [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]].\n\n===Neustadt International Prize for Literature===\nThe [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] was launched in 1969 under Ivask.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/blog/once-over/1969-neustadt-prize-charter|title=The 1969 Neustadt Prize Charter|date=2019-09-13|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> This biennial award, which brought an original purse of $10,000 and currently bestows $50,000, is supported by an endowment through the [[University of Oklahoma]], from the Oklahoma- and Texas-based Neustadt family. The Neustadt Prize was the first international prize for literature of this scope to originate in the United States, and it remains one of the very few literary prizes on an international scale for which novelists, playwrights, and poets are equally eligible (the only stipulation dictates that at least a representative portion of the author's work must be available in English). Each Neustadt Prize winner is selected by a different jury, chosen by the executive director (who is the only permanent member) in consultation with the journal's editors and the president of the University of Oklahoma. Each juror nominates one author, and all nominations are made public several months before the jury convenes on the campus in the fall of odd-numbered years. The group meets for one to two days behind closed doors, and the laureate then receives the award at a banquet the following year. Also, a special section of the journal is subsequently devoted to that author's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neustadt International Prize for Literature|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/neustadt-prize.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>\n\nAn overview of the twenty-five Prizes awarded to date includes the esteemed group of winners selected over the past thirty years: [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] (1970, Italy), [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1972, Colombia), [[Francis Ponge]] (1974, France), [[Elizabeth Bishop]] (1976, USA), [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]] (1978, Poland), [[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]] (1980, Czechoslovakia/Canada), [[Octavio Paz]] (1982, Mexico), [[Paavo Haavikko]] (1984, Finland), [[Max Frisch]] (1986, Switzerland), [[Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer]] (1990, Sweden), [[Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto]] (1992, Brazil), [[Kamau Brathwaite]] (1994, Barbados), [[Assia Djebar]] (1996, Algeria), [[Nuruddin Farah]] (1998, Somalia), [[David Malouf]] (2000, Australia), [[\u00c1lvaro Mutis]] (2002, Colombia), [[Adam Zagajewski]] (2004, Poland), [[Claribel Alegr\u00eda]] (2006, Nicaragua/El Salvador) [[Patricia Grace]] (2008, New Zealand), [[Duo Duo]] (2010, China), and [[Rohinton Mistry]] (2012, India/Canada), Mia Couto (2014, Mozambique), Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107 (2016, transnational), Edwidge Danticat (2018, Haiti), and Ismail Kadare (2020, Albania).<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Laureates of the Neustadt International Prize for Literature|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/past-laureates.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>  In 2009 the week's events were renamed the [[Neustadt Festival of International Literature and Culture]]. During the festivals, ''WLT'' celebrates the culture and achievements of the Neustadt laureate or features readings by the Neustadt jurors, which allows students from the [[University of Oklahoma]] and the [[Norman, OK]] community to interact with world-class writers.\n\n===Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture===\nThe second major event associated with ''WLT'' is the [[Puterbaugh Conference on World Literature|Puterbaugh Festival of International Literature and Culture]], sponsored by the journal in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma Departments of English and Modern Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics. The Puterbaugh series of conferences began in 1968 and was originally named the Oklahoma Conference on Writers of the Hispanic World. It was endowed in perpetuity in 1978 by the Puterbaugh Foundation of McAlester, Oklahoma. In that year, the scope of the conference was expanded to include writers of the French-speaking world, as well as from Spain and Spanish America.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggan|first=William S.|title=The Puterbaugh Conferences|journal=Sooner Magazine|date=Summer 1983|volume=3|issue=4|pages=26\u201331|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p26-31_1983v3n4_OCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, all restrictions were removed, and, since that date, all living writers have been potentially eligible for the honor. The Puterbaugh Festival brings a prominent author to the Norman campus for approximately one week, during which he or she visits classes, gives public lectures and readings, and is honored by a symposium featuring scholars and specialists who discuss the author's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Puterbaugh Tradition at the University of Oklahoma|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/puterbaugh-festival.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>  The list of those who have been featured in the Puterbaugh Festival includes highly visible writers honored (some of whom have also won the Neustadt Prize): [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]] (1968, Spain), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1969, Argentina), [[Octavio Paz]] (1971, Mexico), [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]] (1973, Spain), [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] (1975, Argentina), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (1977, Peru), [[Yves Bonnefoy]] (1979, France), [[Michel Butor]] (1981, France), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (1983, Mexico), [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]] (1987, Cuba), [[Edouard Glissant]] (1989, Martinique), [[Manuel Puig]] (1991, Argentina), [[Maryse Cond\u00e9]] (1993, Guadeloupe), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (1995, Argentina), [[J.M.G.

The award\u2014made possible through the generosity of Nancy Barcelo, Susan Neustadt Schwartz, and Kathy Neustadt, the three daughters of Walter Jr. and Dolores Neustadt\u2014is awarded every other year to a living writer with significant achievement. Laureates receive a check for $35,000, a silver medallion, and a certificate at a public ceremony at the University of Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web|title=NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature|url=http://www.ou.edu/worldlit/nsk-childrens-prize.html|publisher=World Literature Today}}</ref>\n\nTo date, the winners of the NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since the inception of ''Books Abroad'', the series of editors associated with the journal has encouraged lively debate about the annual announcement of the Nobel Prize, as with the 1940 \"Super-Nobel\" election sponsored in ''Books Abroad'', in which contributors and other specialists were invited to choose the writer who they felt had offered the most significant contribution to world literature in the first third of the twentieth century, whether or not that writer had won the Nobel Prize. At the top of the \"Super-Nobel\" list were several non-Nobel winners, such as [[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Theodore Dreiser]], but the award went to [[Thomas Mann]], who had, in fact, won the Nobel in 1929 and who became a frequent contributor to ''Books Abroad''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggan|first=William|title=The Nobel Connection|journal=Sooner Magazine|date=Spring 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16\u201317|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p16-20_1981v1n1_OCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, ''WLT'' founding editor Roy Temple House was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  The South Central Modern Language Association held its annual meeting in Norman, Oklahoma in October of that year, and the membership formally endorsed Professor House for the prize on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Daniel|title=Editor's Note|journal=World Literature Today|date=May 2015|volume=89|issue=3|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2015/may/editors-note-may-2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, ''Books Abroad'' often featured the topic of the Nobel Prize, as with the series of symposia published periodically in the journal: \"Prodding the Nobel Prize Committee\" (1932), \"Nominations for the Nobel Prize for Literature\" (1935), \"Books Abroad's Super-Nobel Election\" (1940), \"What's Wrong with the Nobel Prize?\" (1951),  and \"Nobel Prize Symposium\" (1967). In these symposia, critics, scholars, and authors discussed the policies and procedures of the Swedish Academy as well as the very secretive selection process and the sometimes-curious choices of winners for a literary prize (such as Winston Churchill, the 1953 laureate, and Bertrand Russell, the 1951 laureate).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggan|first=William|title=The Nobel Connection|journal=Sooner Magazine|date=Spring 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17\u201318|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p16-20_1981v1n1_OCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Spring 1981 issue of ''WLT'' was devoted entirely to the presentation of the members of the Swedish academy, many of whom were successful creative writers in their own right. In 1951 the Nobel Foundation chose the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] to issue the first English-language edition of its own authoritative volume, entitled ''Nobel: The Man and His Prizes''. Also, the often-synchronistic relationship between the Neustadt Prize, once described by the ''New York Times'' as the \"Oklahoma 'Nobel'\" (February 1982),<ref>{{cite news|last=McDOWELL|first=Edwin|title=PUBLISHING: The Oklahoma 'Nobel'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/26/books/publishing-the-oklahoma-nobel.html?scp=1&sq=Oklahoma+Nobel+Neustadt&st=nyt|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 26, 1982}}</ref> and the Nobel Prize itself is demonstrated in the number of convergences. Between 1970 and 2016, thirty-two writers affiliated with the Neustadt Prize (as jurors, candidates, or winners) went on to receive the Nobel after their association with the Neustadt, including [[Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer]], the 1990 Neustadt laureate and 2011 Nobel laureate.\n\n==Recent history==\n\nIn late 2000, the editors worked with forty scholars to establish a list of the \"Most Important Works in World Literature, 1927-2001,\" a project organized and timed to help celebrate ''WLT'''s seventy-fifth year of uninterrupted publication.  The top 40 list was chosen by specialists, but with the nonspecialist in mind, with the intention of inviting response and debate among readers and writers.\nFurther, a forum for readers' correspondence was also initiated in 2000.<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=from the editors of World Literature Today ; Pamela A. Genova|title=Twayne Companion to Contemporary World Literature|year=2003|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8057-1700-6|pages=xxi}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, with its combination of award-winning editing and design along with special sections on broad contemporary topics like Belief in an Age of Intolerance, Speculative Fiction, and Literary Activism, ''WLT'' functions as a hybrid academic/creative magazine to chronicle and interpret the most current developments in world literature\u2014topics generally outside the purview of purely academic journals or popular magazines.\n\n=== What to Read Now ===\nWLT invites prominent writers from different regions of the world to be guest editors of the popular column \"What to Read Now\". The writers select the most relevant and timely books on a genre, country, cultural theme, or political topic, such as the Puerto Rican poet [[Giannina Braschi]] on \"What to Read Now: Mixed-Genre Literature\" or the London-based Zimbabwean novelist [[Brian Chikwava]] on \"What to Read Now: Zimbabwe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=World Literature Today |url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2012/september/what-read-now-mixed-genre-literature-giannina-braschi|publisher=World Literature Today|date=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Articles style ===\nIn \"Back to the Essay: World Literature Today in the Twenty-First Century,\" Davis-Undiano  argued for a move away from the stilted academic style of the scholarly article, favoring instead the more creative, experimental, and unrestrained form of the essay. He explains:\n\n<blockquote>The essay tradition is not a prescriptive one of writing in a certain mold, but a capacious one defined mainly by a strategy for maintaining effective ties among writing form, the material being discussed, and the intended audience. Essays in the main tradition tend to have a definable perspective, even on occasion a personal one, and they speak in an idiom that reaches a broad audience. They tend to emphasize the occasion for foregrounding a question or issue as important, and they tend to demonstrate the argument in the form of the essay itself.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davis-Undiano|first=R.C.|title=Back to the Essay: ''World Literature Today'' in the Twenty-First Century|journal=World Literature Today|date=Winter 2000|volume=74|issue=1|pages=4\u20139|url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/sites/default/files/static/docs/davis-undiano-back-to-the-essay.pdf|doi=10.2307/40155302|jstor=40155302}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe linked the contemporary editorial project embodied in ''WLT'' with a time-honored literary tradition, illustrated by the work of  [[Michel de Montaigne]] and [[Francis Bacon]], emphasizing the etymology of the word \"essay,\" which evokes experimentation, trial and error, and the exploration of a mind faced with the current adventures of world culture.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of literary magazines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org ''World Literature Today'' official site]\n\n{{University of Oklahoma}}\n\n[[Category:American bimonthly magazines]]\n[[Category:American literary magazines]]\n[[Category:Cultural magazines]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1927]]\n[[Category:University of Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Magazines published in Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:1927 establishments in Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Literary translation magazines]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Literature_Today"}

UMKC is one of four campuses that collectively constitute the [[University of Missouri System]], and one of only two with a medical school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umsystem.edu/|title=University of Missouri System|website=www.umsystem.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref> As of 2015, the university's enrollment exceeded 16,000 students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umsystem.edu/|title=University of Missouri System |website=www.umsystem.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref> It is the largest university and third largest college in the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/subscriber-only/2017/12/01/largest-colleges-and-universities-in-kc.html|title=Largest Kansas City-Area Colleges and Universities|last=Diaz-Camacho|first=Vicky|date=2017-12-01|website=Kansas City Business Journal}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Lincoln and Lee University===\nThe school has its roots in the '''Lincoln and Lee University''' movement first put forth by the [[Methodist Church]] and its Bishop [[Ernest Lynn Waldorf]] in the 1920s. The proposed university (which was to honor [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]) was to be built on the [[Missouri]]&ndash;[[Kansas]] border at 75th and State Line Road, where the [[Battle of Westport]] (the largest battle west of the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[American Civil War]]) took place. The centerpiece of the school was to be a [[National Memorial]] marking the tomb of an unknown Union soldier and unknown Confederate soldier. Proponents of the school said it would be a location \"where North met South and East met West.\" The Methodist interest reflected the church's important role in the development of the Kansas City area through the [[Shawnee Methodist Mission]] which was the second capital of Kansas.\n\nAs the Methodists started having problems piecing together the necessary property, other civic leaders including [[J.C. Nichols]] began pushing to create a cultural center on either side of [[Brush Creek (Blue River)|Brush Creek]], just east of the [[Country Club Plaza]]. According to this plan the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] and [[Kansas City Art Institute]] would be built north of Brush Creek around the estate of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' publisher [[William Rockhill Nelson]] and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a [[junior college]]) would be built south of the creek. In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of ''[[Kansas City Journal-Post]]'' publisher [[Walter S. Dickey]]. The hospital was never built.\n\nIn 1930, after the Methodists had brought the Kansas City Dental School into their fold, the two plans were merged. The new school was to be called \"'''Lincoln and Lee, the University of Kansas City'''.\"<ref>Link Names for Schools \u2013 ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' \u2013 December 16, 1930 \u2013 Page 1</ref> and plans were underway to develop it into a four-year school.\n\nThe university was built on a {{convert|40|acre|ha|2|adj=on}} plot, southeast of the Nelson mansion. [[William Volker]] had purchased and donated this land for the University of Kansas City. The original Volker purchase did not include the Dickey mansion itself. Dickey died unexpectedly in 1931 and Volker acquired it to be the first building.\n\n===University of Kansas City===\n[[File:UMKC Nima 31.jpg|thumb|Block School of Executive Management]]\n{{For|the defunct school in Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City University}}\nThe two groups were to squabble back and forth, with [[Ernest H. Newcomb]] attempting to mediate. The Church did not maintain its ties and the Lincoln and Lee name was abandoned.\n\nThe school announced that it would start if 125 students enrolled. The target was met, and the '''University of Kansas City''', or \"KCU\" for short, held its first classes in October 1933 with a faculty of 17 and a student enrollment of 264.\n\nThe campus (now expanded to {{convert|90|acre|ha|1|disp=or}}) is called the Volker Campus. The Dickey mansion is now Scofield Hall. The second building on the campus, the library, was named for Newcomb. A [[Carl Milles]] fountain on Brush Creek opposite the Nelson Gallery is called the Volker Fountain.\n\nThe University of Kansas City grew quickly, and soon incorporated other existing local private institutions of higher learning. The [[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|Kansas City School of Law]], which was founded in the 1890s and located in [[downtown Kansas City]], merged into the university in 1938. The Kansas City-Western Dental College followed in 1941 and the Kansas City College of Pharmacy merged in 1943. This was followed by the Kansas City Conservatory of Music in 1959. During this period, the university also established the School of Administration in 1953, the School of Education in 1954, and the Division for Continuing Education in 1958.\n\n===University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City===\nOn July 25, 1963, at the urging of alumnus [[Hilary A. Bush]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121020074450/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=0EAF3DC326BD8AFF&p_docnum=1&s_orderid=NB0109081715312923076&s_dlid=DL0109081715315323152&s_ecproduct=DOC&s_ecprodtype=&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=KC&s_referrer=&s_username=americasroof&s_accountid=AC0108122400392400643&s_upgradeable=no ''The Kansas City Star'' \u2013 May 22, 1992]</ref> the university became part of the [[University of Missouri System]] and $20 million of assets including 23 buildings were transferred to the University of Missouri. At the time of the acquisition, KCU had 3,300 students (2,000 full-time) and 175 full-time faculty.<ref>K.C.U., M.U. Plan a Merger \u2013 ''Kansas City Times'' \u2013 February 26, 1963</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the University of Missouri acquired the Normandy Residence Center in St. Louis to form the [[University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis]]. The acquisitions of the two schools were different in that the privately owned University of Kansas City could be donated to Missouri while the University of Missouri had to buy the St. Louis campus (although for a nominal $60,000) because the St. Louis campus had been purchased for a junior college in a bond election by the public [[Normandy, Missouri]] School District.\n\nAt the time of acquisition Missouri already owned the campuses in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] and [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]]. Accordingly, the university's name was changed to the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City.\n\nAfter this, UMKC established the School of Graduate Studies in 1964, the School of Medicine in 1970, the School of Nursing in 1980, the School of Basic Life Sciences in 1985 (which was renamed the School of Biological Sciences in the mid-1990s), and the School of Computing and Engineering in 2001.\n\nIn 2012, the school conducted studies on whether to rename the school back to the University of Kansas City (but still remaining in the University of Missouri system). In November 2012, the school decided against the change noting at the time, \"while prospective students and the community at large had strong interest in the name change, several other important groups \u2014 current students, faculty/staff, and alumni \u2014 do not favor a name change at this time.\"<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3898418/umkc-says-no-to-name-change.html#storylink=cpy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103211013/http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3898418/umkc-says-no-to-name-change.html|date=2012-11-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid and late 2010s, UMKC came under fire for corruption and cover ups that alleged a pursuit of outside money above all else.<ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article231135763.html \"After hiding details about student\u2019s death, UMKC needs to change its cover-up culture\"]</ref><ref>[https://sentinelksmo.org/still-another-umkc-prof-accused-of-exploiting-foreign-students/ \"UMKC Prof Accused of Modern Slavery\"]</ref> Critics highlighted examples in the management school and pharmaceutical school including a faculty member who required international students to perform personal tasks for him and false information used to rank the business school.<ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article221876590.html \"UMKC widens investigation after Star found professor used his students as servants\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article220872325.html \"Professor used students as servants\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article9640337.html \"UMKC chancellor apologizes for use of flawed data in pursuit of rankings\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article9463514.html \"Bloch School leader: No. 1 ranking lacked credibility\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article811481.html \"A deceptive jobs claim keeps cropping up at Bloch School\"]</ref>\n\n===Chancellors===\n[[File:UMKC Nima 25.jpg|thumb|Grant Hall]]\nPresidents (when the school was independent)/Chancellors (when the school became part of the University of Missouri system) of the school are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/chancellor/former-umkc-chancellors.asp |title=Historical listing of all UMKC Chancellors |publisher=Umkc.edu |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>[[Ernest H.

The \"Hospital Hill\" campus houses the health sciences academic departments.\n\nDirectly across Troost from UMKC is [[Rockhurst University]], a Jesuit university.\n\n===Hospital Hill Campus===\nThe Hospital Hill Campus houses the [[nursing|School of Nursing]], the [[UMKC School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], and the [[pharmacy|School of Pharmacy]].\n\n===Buildings===\n'''Cockefair Hall'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 09.jpg|thumb|Nichols Library]]\nCockefair, (pronounced coke-fair), is located on Rockhill across from Flarsheim Hall. It was built in 1950 and is named for former faculty member Carolyn Cockefair who was a humanities professor at UMKC. The building currently houses the departments of History, English, and Philosophy.\n\n'''Biological Sciences Building'''\n\nBuilt in 1972, the Biological Sciences Building is located north of the Spencer Chemistry Building and east of Katz Hall. The building houses offices, classrooms, and research laboratories of the School of Biological Sciences. The school offers undergrad, grad, and doctoral degrees in the life sciences.  The Biological Sciences Building and Spencer Chemistry Building are connected on four of its floors; in addition to this, the south stairwell on the basement floor of the Biological Sciences Building is the north stairwell of the Spencer Chemistry Building.\n\n'''Spencer Chemistry Building'''\n\nThe building, located at 51st & Rockhill, was built in 1972 using funds donated by Helen Spencer. The purpose of the building was to nurture scientific advancement at UMKC. It currently houses the main office of the Chemistry Department as well as several chemistry laboratories and classrooms. Spencer Chemistry Building and the Biological Sciences Building are connected on four of its floors.\n\n'''The Quad'''\n\nThe majority of UMKC's students regularly attend classes in buildings on the Quad. These buildings are Flarsheim Hall, Newcomb Hall, Manheim Hall, Royall Hall, Haag Hall, and Scofield Hall.\n\n'''Flarsheim Hall'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 03.jpg|thumb|Swinney Rec Center]]\nFlarsheim Hall was built in 1999, and is the largest building on UMKC's campus. The Chemistry, Physics and Geosciences departments, as well as the School of Computing and Engineering, are located in Flarsheim Hall. The hall was named after Robert H. Flarsheim, who left a $9 million endowment to the University in his estate. Flarsheim Hall is located on the northeast corner of the Quad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/flarsheim.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Newcomb Hall'''\n\nNewcomb Hall (built in 1936) was named after the first manager of the University, Ernest H. Newcomb. Originally designed to house the library, Newcomb Hall is now home to offices, the University Archives, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection and the Edgar Snow Collections. Newcomb Hall is located on the extreme west edge of the quad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/newcomb.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Manheim Hall'''\n\nManheim Hall, along with Newcomb Hall were the first two buildings originally built for the University. It is named for [[Ernest Manheim]], a professor of sociology, who taught at the university and founded its sociology program. Currently, Manheim Hall houses offices. It is connected to Royall Hall by a second-floor walkway. Manheim is located on the southwest corner of the Quad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/manheim.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Royall Hall'''\n\nRoyall Hall was built in 1968 and is almost exclusively classrooms. Two large lecture halls are on the ground floor, and an astronomical observatory is on the roof. Also on the ground floor is a lounge area with an [[Einstein Bros. Bagels]]. Royall Hall is connected to both Manheim and Haag Halls, and to a five-level parking structure across the street.

Its most recognizable features are the large murals stretching along the main stairwell. Haag Hall is connected to both Royall and Flarsheim Halls. Haag Hall is located on the southeast corner of the Quad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/haag.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Scofield Hall'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 13.jpg|thumb|Scofield Hall at UMKC]]\nScofield Hall was built in 1912, and was originally a private residence. In 1931, William Volker acquired it and donated it to the University. It was named after Carleton Scofield, who was chancellor of the University when it merged with the [[University of Missouri System]]. The Arts & Sciences advising office as well as the Language Resource Center and the Department of Foreign Languages & Literatures are located in Scofield Hall. Scofield Hall is located on the north end of the Quad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/scofield.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Katz Hall'''\n\nCompleted in 1965, Katz Hall is named in honor of Isaac and Michael Katz, founders of a major Kansas City drug store chain. The building currently houses the Department of Architecture, Urban Planning + Design's offices and classrooms and was once the location for the School of Pharmacy. The Pharmacy School has now moved to the Health Sciences Building on UMKC's Hospital Hill campus, approximately four miles north of the Volker Campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/katz-hall.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City |work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''University Center and Atterbury Student Success Center'''\n\nThe University Center (known to students and alumni as the \"U-Center\") was built in 1961. The student dining hall is located here, as is Pierson Auditorium, an often used site for career fairs or luncheons. In 2012, the University Center underwent renovations and was rededicated as the Atterbury Student Success Center. It was specifically designed to promote student academic success.\n\n'''Swinney Recreation Center'''\n\nSwinney Recreation Center was built in 1941, and was gifted to the University by E. F. Swinney. There are five basketball courts, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, raquetball and squash courts, weight-training center, soccer field, and indoor and outdoor tracks at the recreation center. Along with the [[Kansas City Club]] and the [[Pembroke Hill School]], Swinney is one of only three locations in Kansas City containing squash courts.<ref>[http://www.ussquash.com/ssm/pages/Club_information.asp?orgid=127]''[[U.S. Squash|United States Squash Racquets Association]]: Missouri facility locations'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717181246/http://www.ussquash.com/ssm/pages/Club_information.asp?orgid=127|date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> University students, faculty and staff have privileges at Swinney, and paid memberships are open to others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/swinney.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Fine Arts Building'''\n\nThe Fine Arts Building was built in 1942 and remodeled in 1975.

Student works are often displayed in the building's UMKC Gallery of Art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/finearts.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref>\n\n'''Epperson House'''\n{{Main|Epperson House}}\n\nEpperson House is located south of 52nd St. between Oak and Cherry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/perspectives/features/house-on-the-hill/ |title=House on the hill &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref> The Tudor-Gothic structure was completed in 1923 at a cost of $450,000. Originally built as a private residence, Epperson House contained 48 rooms, six bathrooms, elevators, a swimming pool, and a billiard room, spread throughout it four floors. The residence was built by Uriah S. Epperson, who was a banker, industrialist, and philanthropist who amassed significant wealth from insurance and meat-packing industries. The building was donated to the university in 1942 for use as a men's dormitory until 1956. Epperson is well known for its apparent hauntings, which earned it a spot on [[Unsolved Mysteries]] as one of the top five haunted houses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/VirtualTour/epperson.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref><ref>[http://media.www.unews.com/media/storage/paper274/news/2004/10/25/News/Epperson.House.Shrouded.In.Haunted.History-780629.shtml Epperson House shrouded in haunted history \u2013 News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331221511/http://media.www.unews.com/media/storage/paper274/news/2004/10/25/News/Epperson.House.Shrouded.In.Haunted.History-780629.shtml |date=March 31, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/static/Entertainment/halloween/HalloweenFLASH//spookyhouse.swf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029185203/http://www.kansascity.com/static/Entertainment/halloween/HalloweenFLASH//spookyhouse.swf|date=October 29, 2008}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}'''James C.

It housed approximately 300 students in 168 single, double and triple rooms with each floor being separated by gender and sharing a communal bathroom. Cherry Street Hall was often regarded by students as having better opportunities for social interaction than Oak Street. In August 2009, Cherry Street Hall was closed as a student residence. In May 2011 the Psychology Department moved into the newly renovated Cherry Hall.\n\n'''Twin Oaks Apartments'''\n\nFormerly located at 5000 Oak Street, Twin Oaks Apartments was acquired by the University in 1998 to house students who desired more independent living than the dormitory could provide. In the years since, however, the buildings had begun to show their ages. In 2002, the University decided it would be more cost-effective to demolish Twin Oaks and build a new residence hall in its place. UMKC stopped renting to new prospective tenants in 2005, and to current tenant extended a grace period for them to locate new housing. The buildings were completely vacant by July 2006. In September 2006, the Kansas City Fire Department used Twin Oaks in a firefighters training program. Demolition by wrecking ball followed in November 2006 and was completed in early 2007.\n\n'''Oak Street Hall'''\n\nCompleted in 2004, Oak Street Hall is located at 5051 Oak Street. The five-story building houses approximately 559 students in single room and suite-style two-bedroom suites. The ground level is a large common lobby with a kitchen, laundry facility, music practice rooms, pool tables and a widescreen television set. On floors 2-5, [[kitchenette]]s, vending machines, quiet study rooms and social lounges comprise the common areas. Oak Hall was set as the quality standard for the UMKC 30-year Master Plan.\n\n'''Oak Place Apartments'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 41.jpg|thumb|Student Union, overlooking The Plaza]]\nThe Oak Place Apartments are located at 5050 Oak Street on land once occupied by the demolished Twin Oaks Apartments. Twin Oaks construction on Oak Place was started in 2007 and Oak Place was opened to students in August 2008. Oak Place consists of two four story apartment complexes separated by an above ground parking structure. Oak Place houses around 500 students in 1, 2, and 4 bedroom suite style apartments, each complete with a kitchen. Common areas include lounge areas, an academic room, and 1 computer lab in each building.\n\n'''Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall'''\n\nHerman and Dorothy Johnson Hall is the latest residence hall on the UMKC Volker Campus and is located to the immediate north of Oak Place Apartments. Construction was started in June 2008 and the hall opened in August 2009. The four story hall houses up to 328 students in the traditional dormitory style with suites of single and double occupancy rooms with their own shared suite bathroom. Johnson Hall has gender-segregated by floor housing. Common areas include music practice rooms, a computer lab, laundry rooms, and outdoor green space. The building was designed by Mackey Mitchell Architects of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n==Student activities==\n\n===Greek life===\nGreek Life at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City is administered by the Office of Student Involvement's Fraternity and Sorority Affairs. UMKC is home to 26 Greek Letter Organizations (8 social fraternities, 8 social sororities, and 10 professional fraternities). Although the Greek population is relatively small (4.5% of the overall student population), it maintains a proud heritage, and several chapters have received awards from their organization's international offices.\n\nGreek Life at UMKC traces its origins to 1936, with the establishment of the Bounders Fraternity. The Bounders was the first social organization recognized by the University of Kansas City, and the fraternity originated many of UMKC's school traditions. The Bounders even led the push for the removal of university president Clarence Decker. Decker's resignation in 1953 opened the door for both intercollegiate athletics and national Greek organizations on campus. In 1956, the Bounders petitioned [[Delta Chi]] and received a charter. Delta Chi became the first national fraternity to charter on the UMKC campus. The Delta Rho chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] was founded four years earlier, in 1952; however, it was originally chartered at nearby [[Rockhurst University]] and did not submit its charter for official recognition by UMKC until 1963.<ref name=\"umkc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/commencement/content.cfm?id=20 |title=UMKC Commencement |publisher=Umkc.edu |date=1989-05-12 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!|Panhellenic Council\n!|Interfraternity Council\n!|[[National Pan-Hellenic Council]]\n!|Professional Fraternities\n!|Locals\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*'''[[Chi Omega]]''' (1961\u2013present)\n*'''[[Alpha Delta Pi]]''' (1962\u2013present)\n* ''[[Sigma Delta Tau]]'' (1967\u20131971)\n*'''[[Delta Zeta]]''' (1987\u2013present)\n*'''[[Alpha Sigma Alpha]]''' (2011\u2013present)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* ''[[Delta Chi]]'' (1956\u20132002)\n* ''[[Tau Kappa Epsilon]]'' (1956\u20131980)\n* ''[[Alpha Epsilon Pi]]'' (1956\u20131972)\n* ''[[Sigma Tau Gamma]]'' (1969\u20131991)\n* ''[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]'' (1976\u20132015)\n*'''[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]''' (1977\u2013present)\n*'''[[Beta Theta Pi]]''' (1989\u2013present)\n*'''[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]''' (2006\u2013present)\n*'''[[Lambda Theta Phi]]''' (2010\u2013present)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*'''[[Alpha Phi Alpha]]''' (*1952\u2013present)\n*'''[[Phi Beta Sigma]]''' (1973-?, 2005\u2013present)\n*'''[[Delta Sigma Theta]]''' (1974\u2013present)\n*'''[[Sigma Gamma Rho]]''' (1982-?, 2007\u2013present)\n*'''[[Kappa Alpha Psi]]''' (1987\u2013present)\n* ''[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]'' (1992\u2013present)\n*'''[[Zeta Phi Beta]]''' (2006\u2013present)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* [[Alpha Kappa Psi]] (business)\n* [[Alpha Phi Omega]] (service)\n* [[Delta Sigma Delta]] (dental)\n* [[Delta Theta Phi]] (law)\n* [[Delta Sigma Pi]] (business)\n* [[Kappa Epsilon]] (pharmaceutical)\n* [[Kappa Psi]] (pharmaceutical)\n* [[Xi Psi Phi]] (dental)\n* [[Phi Alpha Delta]] (law)\n* [[Phi Delta Phi]] (law)\n* [[Psi Omega]] (dental)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* [[Delta Rho]] Local Sorority\n|}\n\n===Traditions===\n'''Hobo Day and Bum Friday'''\n\nOne of the best known traditions in the history of UMKC was Hobo Day, later known as Bum Friday. The campus-wide event was created as Hobo Day, and it first occurred on May 8, 1935, to celebrate the end of the spring semester. Students dressed as hobos throughout the day, and various events and competitions took place. The day started with the Hobo parade, and then everyone gathered in the quad where university president Clarence Decker would read a proclamation that he was cancelling classes and turning the university over to the students. President Decker was an appropriate master of ceremonies for the day, as he had lived the life of a [[hobo]] during a portion of his younger years. Events throughout the day included beard growing contests, pie eating contests, glee club performances, skits satirizing campus life, car rallies, talent shows, and athletic contests. The Bum Friday Queen and the Most Fascinating Man were crowned, and the day ended with a dance in which students switched out their bum attire for formal wear. Awards for the daytime activities were presented at the dance. A bonfire closed out the evening. In 1951, Hobo Day was renamed Bum Friday, although the activities essentially remained the same. In 1982, the Student Life Office put a stop to Bum Friday and replaced it with \"Roo Fest\", which lacked many of the activities and traditions of Bum Friday and its predecessor, Hobo Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/unews/hobo-day-a-tradition-of-the-past/ |title=Hobo Day: a tradition of the past \u2013 University News &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/perspectives/campus-news/2606/ |title=Birth and death of a tradition &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=1935-05-08 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n'''The Bounder Bells'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 45.jpg|thumb|Spencer Chemistry]]\nAlumni members of the former Bounders Fraternity raised nearly $30,000 in donations for the purchase of a Van Bergen 49-bell [[carillon]].

The proposed university (which was to honor [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]) was to be built on the [[Missouri]]&ndash;[[Kansas]] border at 75th and State Line Road, where the [[Battle of Westport]] (the largest battle west of the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[American Civil War]]) took place. The centerpiece of the school was to be a [[National Memorial]] marking the tomb of an unknown Union soldier and unknown Confederate soldier. Proponents of the school said it would be a location \"where North met South and East met West.\" The Methodist interest reflected the church's important role in the development of the Kansas City area through the [[Shawnee Methodist Mission]] which was the second capital of Kansas.\n\nAs the Methodists started having problems piecing together the necessary property, other civic leaders including [[J.C. Nichols]] began pushing to create a cultural center on either side of [[Brush Creek (Blue River)|Brush Creek]], just east of the [[Country Club Plaza]]. According to this plan the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] and [[Kansas City Art Institute]] would be built north of Brush Creek around the estate of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' publisher [[William Rockhill Nelson]] and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a [[junior college]]) would be built south of the creek. In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of ''[[Kansas City Journal-Post]]'' publisher [[Walter S. Dickey]]. The hospital was never built.\n\nIn 1930, after the Methodists had brought the Kansas City Dental School into their fold, the two plans were merged. The new school was to be called \"'''Lincoln and Lee, the University of Kansas City'''.\"<ref>Link Names for Schools \u2013 ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' \u2013 December 16, 1930 \u2013 Page 1</ref> and plans were underway to develop it into a four-year school.\n\nThe university was built on a {{convert|40|acre|ha|2|adj=on}} plot, southeast of the Nelson mansion. [[William Volker]] had purchased and donated this land for the University of Kansas City. The original Volker purchase did not include the Dickey mansion itself. Dickey died unexpectedly in 1931 and Volker acquired it to be the first building.\n\n===University of Kansas City===\n[[File:UMKC Nima 31.jpg|thumb|Block School of Executive Management]]\n{{For|the defunct school in Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City University}}\nThe two groups were to squabble back and forth, with [[Ernest H. Newcomb]] attempting to mediate. The Church did not maintain its ties and the Lincoln and Lee name was abandoned.\n\nThe school announced that it would start if 125 students enrolled. The target was met, and the '''University of Kansas City''', or \"KCU\" for short, held its first classes in October 1933 with a faculty of 17 and a student enrollment of 264.\n\nThe campus (now expanded to {{convert|90|acre|ha|1|disp=or}}) is called the Volker Campus. The Dickey mansion is now Scofield Hall. The second building on the campus, the library, was named for Newcomb. A [[Carl Milles]] fountain on Brush Creek opposite the Nelson Gallery is called the Volker Fountain.\n\nThe University of Kansas City grew quickly, and soon incorporated other existing local private institutions of higher learning. The [[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|Kansas City School of Law]], which was founded in the 1890s and located in [[downtown Kansas City]], merged into the university in 1938. The Kansas City-Western Dental College followed in 1941 and the Kansas City College of Pharmacy merged in 1943. This was followed by the Kansas City Conservatory of Music in 1959. During this period, the university also established the School of Administration in 1953, the School of Education in 1954, and the Division for Continuing Education in 1958.\n\n===University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City===\nOn July 25, 1963, at the urging of alumnus [[Hilary A.

At the time of the acquisition, KCU had 3,300 students (2,000 full-time) and 175 full-time faculty.<ref>K.C.U., M.U. Plan a Merger \u2013 ''Kansas City Times'' \u2013 February 26, 1963</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the University of Missouri acquired the Normandy Residence Center in St. Louis to form the [[University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis]]. The acquisitions of the two schools were different in that the privately owned University of Kansas City could be donated to Missouri while the University of Missouri had to buy the St. Louis campus (although for a nominal $60,000) because the St. Louis campus had been purchased for a junior college in a bond election by the public [[Normandy, Missouri]] School District.\n\nAt the time of acquisition Missouri already owned the campuses in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] and [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]]. Accordingly, the university's name was changed to the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City.\n\nAfter this, UMKC established the School of Graduate Studies in 1964, the School of Medicine in 1970, the School of Nursing in 1980, the School of Basic Life Sciences in 1985 (which was renamed the School of Biological Sciences in the mid-1990s), and the School of Computing and Engineering in 2001.\n\nIn 2012, the school conducted studies on whether to rename the school back to the University of Kansas City (but still remaining in the University of Missouri system). In November 2012, the school decided against the change noting at the time, \"while prospective students and the community at large had strong interest in the name change, several other important groups \u2014 current students, faculty/staff, and alumni \u2014 do not favor a name change at this time.\"<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3898418/umkc-says-no-to-name-change.html#storylink=cpy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103211013/http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3898418/umkc-says-no-to-name-change.html|date=2012-11-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid and late 2010s, UMKC came under fire for corruption and cover ups that alleged a pursuit of outside money above all else.<ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article231135763.html \"After hiding details about student\u2019s death, UMKC needs to change its cover-up culture\"]</ref><ref>[https://sentinelksmo.org/still-another-umkc-prof-accused-of-exploiting-foreign-students/ \"UMKC Prof Accused of Modern Slavery\"]</ref> Critics highlighted examples in the management school and pharmaceutical school including a faculty member who required international students to perform personal tasks for him and false information used to rank the business school.<ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article221876590.html \"UMKC widens investigation after Star found professor used his students as servants\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article220872325.html \"Professor used students as servants\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article9640337.html \"UMKC chancellor apologizes for use of flawed data in pursuit of rankings\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article9463514.html \"Bloch School leader: No. 1 ranking lacked credibility\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article811481.html \"A deceptive jobs claim keeps cropping up at Bloch School\"]</ref>\n\n===Chancellors===\n[[File:UMKC Nima 25.jpg|thumb|Grant Hall]]\nPresidents (when the school was independent)/Chancellors (when the school became part of the University of Missouri system) of the school are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/chancellor/former-umkc-chancellors.asp |title=Historical listing of all UMKC Chancellors |publisher=Umkc.edu |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>[[Ernest H.

Most of UMKC's main campus (Volker campus) is inside a square formed by Volker Boulevard (north), Oak Street (west), 53rd Street (south) and Troost (east). The \"Hospital Hill\" campus houses the health sciences academic departments.\n\nDirectly across Troost from UMKC is [[Rockhurst University]], a Jesuit university.\n\n===Hospital Hill Campus===\nThe Hospital Hill Campus houses the [[nursing|School of Nursing]], the [[UMKC School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], and the [[pharmacy|School of Pharmacy]].\n\n===Buildings===\n'''Cockefair Hall'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 09.jpg|thumb|Nichols Library]]\nCockefair, (pronounced coke-fair), is located on Rockhill across from Flarsheim Hall. It was built in 1950 and is named for former faculty member Carolyn Cockefair who was a humanities professor at UMKC. The building currently houses the departments of History, English, and Philosophy.\n\n'''Biological Sciences Building'''\n\nBuilt in 1972, the Biological Sciences Building is located north of the Spencer Chemistry Building and east of Katz Hall. The building houses offices, classrooms, and research laboratories of the School of Biological Sciences. The school offers undergrad, grad, and doctoral degrees in the life sciences.  The Biological Sciences Building and Spencer Chemistry Building are connected on four of its floors; in addition to this, the south stairwell on the basement floor of the Biological Sciences Building is the north stairwell of the Spencer Chemistry Building.\n\n'''Spencer Chemistry Building'''\n\nThe building, located at 51st & Rockhill, was built in 1972 using funds donated by Helen Spencer. The purpose of the building was to nurture scientific advancement at UMKC. It currently houses the main office of the Chemistry Department as well as several chemistry laboratories and classrooms. Spencer Chemistry Building and the Biological Sciences Building are connected on four of its floors.\n\n'''The Quad'''\n\nThe majority of UMKC's students regularly attend classes in buildings on the Quad. These buildings are Flarsheim Hall, Newcomb Hall, Manheim Hall, Royall Hall, Haag Hall, and Scofield Hall.\n\n'''Flarsheim Hall'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 03.jpg|thumb|Swinney Rec Center]]\nFlarsheim Hall was built in 1999, and is the largest building on UMKC's campus. The Chemistry, Physics and Geosciences departments, as well as the School of Computing and Engineering, are located in Flarsheim Hall. The hall was named after Robert H. Flarsheim, who left a $9 million endowment to the University in his estate.

Originally built as a private residence, Epperson House contained 48 rooms, six bathrooms, elevators, a swimming pool, and a billiard room, spread throughout it four floors. The residence was built by Uriah S. Epperson, who was a banker, industrialist, and philanthropist who amassed significant wealth from insurance and meat-packing industries. The building was donated to the university in 1942 for use as a men's dormitory until 1956. Epperson is well known for its apparent hauntings, which earned it a spot on [[Unsolved Mysteries]] as one of the top five haunted houses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umkc.edu/VirtualTour/epperson.asp|title=PAGE NOT FOUND : University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City|work=umkc.edu}}</ref><ref>[http://media.www.unews.com/media/storage/paper274/news/2004/10/25/News/Epperson.House.Shrouded.In.Haunted.History-780629.shtml Epperson House shrouded in haunted history \u2013 News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331221511/http://media.www.unews.com/media/storage/paper274/news/2004/10/25/News/Epperson.House.Shrouded.In.Haunted.History-780629.shtml |date=March 31, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/static/Entertainment/halloween/HalloweenFLASH//spookyhouse.swf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029185203/http://www.kansascity.com/static/Entertainment/halloween/HalloweenFLASH//spookyhouse.swf|date=October 29, 2008}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}'''James C.

It housed approximately 300 students in 168 single, double and triple rooms with each floor being separated by gender and sharing a communal bathroom. Cherry Street Hall was often regarded by students as having better opportunities for social interaction than Oak Street. In August 2009, Cherry Street Hall was closed as a student residence. In May 2011 the Psychology Department moved into the newly renovated Cherry Hall.\n\n'''Twin Oaks Apartments'''\n\nFormerly located at 5000 Oak Street, Twin Oaks Apartments was acquired by the University in 1998 to house students who desired more independent living than the dormitory could provide. In the years since, however, the buildings had begun to show their ages. In 2002, the University decided it would be more cost-effective to demolish Twin Oaks and build a new residence hall in its place. UMKC stopped renting to new prospective tenants in 2005, and to current tenant extended a grace period for them to locate new housing. The buildings were completely vacant by July 2006. In September 2006, the Kansas City Fire Department used Twin Oaks in a firefighters training program. Demolition by wrecking ball followed in November 2006 and was completed in early 2007.\n\n'''Oak Street Hall'''\n\nCompleted in 2004, Oak Street Hall is located at 5051 Oak Street. The five-story building houses approximately 559 students in single room and suite-style two-bedroom suites. The ground level is a large common lobby with a kitchen, laundry facility, music practice rooms, pool tables and a widescreen television set. On floors 2-5, [[kitchenette]]s, vending machines, quiet study rooms and social lounges comprise the common areas. Oak Hall was set as the quality standard for the UMKC 30-year Master Plan.\n\n'''Oak Place Apartments'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 41.jpg|thumb|Student Union, overlooking The Plaza]]\nThe Oak Place Apartments are located at 5050 Oak Street on land once occupied by the demolished Twin Oaks Apartments. Twin Oaks construction on Oak Place was started in 2007 and Oak Place was opened to students in August 2008. Oak Place consists of two four story apartment complexes separated by an above ground parking structure. Oak Place houses around 500 students in 1, 2, and 4 bedroom suite style apartments, each complete with a kitchen. Common areas include lounge areas, an academic room, and 1 computer lab in each building.\n\n'''Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall'''\n\nHerman and Dorothy Johnson Hall is the latest residence hall on the UMKC Volker Campus and is located to the immediate north of Oak Place Apartments. Construction was started in June 2008 and the hall opened in August 2009. The four story hall houses up to 328 students in the traditional dormitory style with suites of single and double occupancy rooms with their own shared suite bathroom. Johnson Hall has gender-segregated by floor housing. Common areas include music practice rooms, a computer lab, laundry rooms, and outdoor green space. The building was designed by Mackey Mitchell Architects of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n==Student activities==\n\n===Greek life===\nGreek Life at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City is administered by the Office of Student Involvement's Fraternity and Sorority Affairs. UMKC is home to 26 Greek Letter Organizations (8 social fraternities, 8 social sororities, and 10 professional fraternities). Although the Greek population is relatively small (4.5% of the overall student population), it maintains a proud heritage, and several chapters have received awards from their organization's international offices.\n\nGreek Life at UMKC traces its origins to 1936, with the establishment of the Bounders Fraternity. The Bounders was the first social organization recognized by the University of Kansas City, and the fraternity originated many of UMKC's school traditions. The Bounders even led the push for the removal of university president Clarence Decker. Decker's resignation in 1953 opened the door for both intercollegiate athletics and national Greek organizations on campus. In 1956, the Bounders petitioned [[Delta Chi]] and received a charter. Delta Chi became the first national fraternity to charter on the UMKC campus. The Delta Rho chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] was founded four years earlier, in 1952; however, it was originally chartered at nearby [[Rockhurst University]] and did not submit its charter for official recognition by UMKC until 1963.<ref name=\"umkc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/commencement/content.cfm?id=20 |title=UMKC Commencement |publisher=Umkc.edu |date=1989-05-12 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!|Panhellenic Council\n!|Interfraternity Council\n!|[[National Pan-Hellenic Council]]\n!|Professional Fraternities\n!|Locals\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*'''[[Chi Omega]]''' (1961\u2013present)\n*'''[[Alpha Delta Pi]]''' (1962\u2013present)\n* ''[[Sigma Delta Tau]]'' (1967\u20131971)\n*'''[[Delta Zeta]]''' (1987\u2013present)\n*'''[[Alpha Sigma Alpha]]''' (2011\u2013present)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* ''[[Delta Chi]]'' (1956\u20132002)\n* ''[[Tau Kappa Epsilon]]'' (1956\u20131980)\n* ''[[Alpha Epsilon Pi]]'' (1956\u20131972)\n* ''[[Sigma Tau Gamma]]'' (1969\u20131991)\n* ''[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]'' (1976\u20132015)\n*'''[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]''' (1977\u2013present)\n*'''[[Beta Theta Pi]]''' (1989\u2013present)\n*'''[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]''' (2006\u2013present)\n*'''[[Lambda Theta Phi]]''' (2010\u2013present)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*'''[[Alpha Phi Alpha]]''' (*1952\u2013present)\n*'''[[Phi Beta Sigma]]''' (1973-?, 2005\u2013present)\n*'''[[Delta Sigma Theta]]''' (1974\u2013present)\n*'''[[Sigma Gamma Rho]]''' (1982-?, 2007\u2013present)\n*'''[[Kappa Alpha Psi]]''' (1987\u2013present)\n* ''[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]'' (1992\u2013present)\n*'''[[Zeta Phi Beta]]''' (2006\u2013present)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* [[Alpha Kappa Psi]] (business)\n* [[Alpha Phi Omega]] (service)\n* [[Delta Sigma Delta]] (dental)\n* [[Delta Theta Phi]] (law)\n* [[Delta Sigma Pi]] (business)\n* [[Kappa Epsilon]] (pharmaceutical)\n* [[Kappa Psi]] (pharmaceutical)\n* [[Xi Psi Phi]] (dental)\n* [[Phi Alpha Delta]] (law)\n* [[Phi Delta Phi]] (law)\n* [[Psi Omega]] (dental)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* [[Delta Rho]] Local Sorority\n|}\n\n===Traditions===\n'''Hobo Day and Bum Friday'''\n\nOne of the best known traditions in the history of UMKC was Hobo Day, later known as Bum Friday. The campus-wide event was created as Hobo Day, and it first occurred on May 8, 1935, to celebrate the end of the spring semester. Students dressed as hobos throughout the day, and various events and competitions took place. The day started with the Hobo parade, and then everyone gathered in the quad where university president Clarence Decker would read a proclamation that he was cancelling classes and turning the university over to the students. President Decker was an appropriate master of ceremonies for the day, as he had lived the life of a [[hobo]] during a portion of his younger years. Events throughout the day included beard growing contests, pie eating contests, glee club performances, skits satirizing campus life, car rallies, talent shows, and athletic contests. The Bum Friday Queen and the Most Fascinating Man were crowned, and the day ended with a dance in which students switched out their bum attire for formal wear. Awards for the daytime activities were presented at the dance. A bonfire closed out the evening. In 1951, Hobo Day was renamed Bum Friday, although the activities essentially remained the same. In 1982, the Student Life Office put a stop to Bum Friday and replaced it with \"Roo Fest\", which lacked many of the activities and traditions of Bum Friday and its predecessor, Hobo Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/unews/hobo-day-a-tradition-of-the-past/ |title=Hobo Day: a tradition of the past \u2013 University News &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/perspectives/campus-news/2606/ |title=Birth and death of a tradition &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=1935-05-08 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n'''The Bounder Bells'''\n[[File:UMKC Nima 45.jpg|thumb|Spencer Chemistry]]\nAlumni members of the former Bounders Fraternity raised nearly $30,000 in donations for the purchase of a Van Bergen 49-bell [[carillon]]. The Bounder Bells was dedicated on the UMKC campus in May 1989. The carillon is located in the tower of the Swinney Recreation Center. The bells controlled by an electronic keyboard, and they ring on the hour. The bells can also can be programmed to play melodies.<ref name=\"umkc.edu\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/news/congratulations-graduates-2/attachment/8650/|title=Ringing of the Bounder Bells|work=UMKC Today}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni and faculty==\n{{main|List of University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City people}}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Kansas City Roos}}\n\nUMKC's mascot is Kasey [[Kangaroo]] (originally drawn by [[Walt Disney]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/unews/a-pouch-of-roo-history-umkc-mascot-was-born-in-walt-disneys-studio/ |title=A pouch of 'Roo history: UMKC mascot was born in Walt Disney's studio \u2013 University News &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref> Historically, UMKC athletics had used the identity of UMKC Kangaroos, but the short form \"Roos\" was widely used both within and outside of the program.

the most successful competitive [[sailors]] in history, with dozens of national and international championships and in many different classes, including two Olympic medals.<ref name=\"A\" />\n\n==Olympic career ==\n\n=== Representing Denmark ===\nFogh represented his country of birth for the first time during the [[Sailing at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Naples]] as helmsman in the Danish [[Sailing at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman|Flying Dutchman]] ''Skum'' with [[Ole Gunnar Petersen]] as crew, and won the silver medal. In [[Sailing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] Fogh returned to the Olympics in [[Enoshima]] again with Ole Gunnar Petersen as crew, Fogh took 4th place in the [[Sailing at the 1964 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman]] ''Miss Denmark 1964''. With crew [[Niels Jensen]] and again in the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman]], Fogh took 16th place in the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] in [[Acapulco]]. The last time Fogh represented Denmark at the Olympics was in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman|Flying Dutchman]] during the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]] in [[Kiel]]. With [[Ulrik Brock]] as crew, Fogh took 7th place.\n\n=== Representing Canada ===\nAfter Fogh emigrated to [[Canada]] he was selected to represent his new country at the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. With [[Evert Bastet]] as crew, Fogh took 4th place in the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman]]. His final Olympic appearance came in the [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Soling|Soling]] at the [[Los Angeles]] [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics]]. With fellow crew members [[Stephen Calder|Steve Calder]] and [[John Kerr (sailor)|John Kerr]] Fogh, as helmsman took the bronze medal.\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn on 8 March 1938 in R\u00f8dovre, Denmark, Fogh grew up in a family of gardeners and was expected to take over the family business. With the encouragement and support of long-time friend and fellow sailor [[Paul Henderson (sailor)|Paul Henderson,]] who managed to lever Fogh\u2019s former career as a gardener, Fogh emigrated to Canada in the 1969 and gained Canadian citizenship in 1975. Fogh was married to Kirsten for 49 years. They have two sons (Morten and Thomas) and five grandchildren. Hans Fogh died from [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] on 14 March 2014 in Toronto.<ref name=\"D\" />\n\n== Professional life ==\nExpected to work in gardening, like the rest of his family, Fogh took a job at ''Elvstrom sailmakers'' where he learned the skills of sailmaking. In 1969 he set up a new sailmaking loft in Canada: ''Elvstrom Canada''. Later he produced sails under the labels: ''Fogh Sails'' and ''North Sails''. His involvement in the development of the standard [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser sail]] and the subsequent [[Laser Radial]] sail, as well as the [[Laser 28]] sails are of his many well-known accomplishments in his profession.<ref name=\"E\" />\n\n== Sailing career ==\nHans Fogh won countless World, Continental, and National Championships in even so many Olympic, International, and National Classes. Hans took part of six Olympic Games (1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976 and 1984) and took a silver medal in the [[Soling]] during the [[Pan Am Games]] in 1987.\nA list of major championships is given on the right.\n\nHe helmed ''Evergreen'' for Don Green during the 1978 [[Canada's Cup]].<ref name=green>[https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2238176-reliving-the-ill-fated-fastnet/ thespec.com: \"Reliving the ill-fated Fastnet\"], 12 May 2007.

The term often includes the [[Julian calendar]] established by the reforms of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Roman emperor|emperor]] [[Augustus]] in the late 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and sometimes includes any system dated by [[inclusive counting]] towards months' [[kalends]], [[nones (calendar)|nones]], and [[ides (calendar)|ides]] in the Roman manner. The term usually excludes the [[Alexandrian calendar]] of [[Roman Egypt]], which continued the unique months of that land's [[Egyptian calendar|former calendar]]; the [[Byzantine calendar]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|later Roman Empire]], which usually dated the Roman months in the simple count of the [[ancient Greek calendar]]s; and the [[Gregorian calendar]], which refined the Julian system to bring it into still closer alignment with the [[tropical year]].\n\nRoman dates were [[inclusive counting|counted inclusively]] forward to the next of three principal days: the first of the month (the kalends), a day shortly before the middle of the month (the ides), and eight days\u2014nine, counting inclusively\u2014before this (the nones). The original calendar consisted of ten months beginning in spring with [[March]]; winter was left as an unassigned span of days. These months ran for 38 [[nundinae|nundinal]] cycles, each forming an eight-day [[week]] (nine days [[inclusive counting|counted inclusively]], hence the name) ended by religious rituals and a public market. The winter period was later divided into two months, [[Ianuarius|January]] and [[Februarius|February]]. The [[Roman legend|legendary]] [[list of kings of Rome|early kings]] [[Romulus]] and [[Numa Pompilius]] were traditionally credited with establishing this early fixed calendar, which bears traces of its origin as an observational [[lunar calendar|lunar one]]. In particular, the kalends, nones, and ides seem to have derived from the first sighting of the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]], the [[first-quarter moon]], and the [[full moon]] respectively. The system ran well short of the solar year, and it needed constant [[wikt:intercalation|intercalation]] to keep [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and other activities in their proper [[season]]s. This is a typical element of [[lunisolar calendar]]s. For superstitious reasons, such intercalation occurred within the month of February even after it was no longer considered the last month.\n\nAfter the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy|establishment]] of the [[Roman Republic]], years began to be dated by [[Roman consul|consulships]] and control over intercalation was granted to the [[pontifex maximus|pontifices]], who eventually abused their power by lengthening years controlled by their political allies and shortening the years in their rivals' terms of office. Having won [[Caesar's civil war|his war]] with [[Pompey the Great|Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] used his position as Rome's [[pontifex maximus|chief pontiff]] to enact a [[Julian reform|calendar reform]] in 46{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, coincidentally making the year of his third consulship last for 446 days. In order to avoid interfering with Rome's religious ceremonies, the reform added all its days towards the ends of months and did not adjust any nones or ides, even in months which came to have 31 days. The Julian calendar was supposed to have a single [[leap day]] on [[February 24|24 February]] (a doubled ''{{lang|la|VI {{linktext|Kal.}} {{linktext|Mart.}}}}'') every fourth year but following [[Assassination of Caesar|Caesar's assassination]] the priests figured this using inclusive counting and mistakenly added the bissextile day every three years. In order to bring the calendar back to its proper place, [[Augustus]] was obliged to suspend intercalation for one or two decades. The revised calendar remained slightly longer than the solar year; by the 16th century the date of [[Easter]] had shifted so far away from the [[vernal equinox]] that [[Pope Gregory&nbsp;XIII]] ordered the calendar\u2019s adjustment, resulting in the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fasti Praenestini Massimo n1.jpg|thumb|The remains of the ''{{lang|la|[[Fasti Praenestini]]}}'']]\n{{anchor|Lunar|Lunar calendar|Prehistory}}\n===Prehistoric lunar calendar===\nThe original Roman [[calendar]] is believed to have been an observational [[lunar calendar]]{{sfnp|Mommsen & al.|1864|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n242/mode/2up 216]}} whose months began from the first signs of a new crescent moon. Because a [[lunar phase|lunar cycle]] is about {{frac|29|1|2}} days long, such months would have varied between 29 and 30 days. Twelve such months would have fallen 10 or 11 days short of the [[solar year]]; without adjustment, such a year would have quickly rotated out of alignment with the seasons in the manner of the [[Islamic calendar]]. Given the seasonal aspects of the later calendar and its associated religious festivals, this was presumably avoided through some form of [[wikt: intercalation|intercalation]] or the suspension of the calendar during winter.\n\nRome's 8-day week, the [[nundinal cycle]], was shared with the [[Etruscans]], who used it as the schedule of royal audiences. It was presumably a part of the early calendar and was credited in [[Roman legend]] variously to [[Romulus]] and [[Servius Tullius]].\n\n{{anchor|Romulus|Romulan calendar|Calendar of Romulus}}\n\n===Legendary 10&nbsp;month calendar===\nThe Romans themselves described their first organized year as one with ten fixed months, each of 30 or 31&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Macrobius|loc=Book I, Ch. 12, \u00a73}}{{sfnp|Kaster|2011|p=137}} Such a decimal division fitted general Roman practice.{{sfnp|Mommsen & al.|1864|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n242/mode/2up 217]}} The four 31&nbsp;day months were called \"full\" (''{{lang|la|[[wikt:pleni menses#Latin|pleni]]}}'') and the others \"hollow\" (''{{lang|la|[[wikt:cavi menses#Latin|cavi]]}}'').<ref>[[Censorinus]], [[Macrobius]], and [[Solinus]], cited in {{harvp|Key|1875}}</ref><ref name=mommy>{{harvp|Mommsen & al.|1864|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n244/mode/2up 218]}}.</ref> Its 304&nbsp;days made up exactly 38&nbsp;[[nundinal cycle]]s.

The total of these months over 4 years differed from the Greeks by 5 days, meaning the Roman intercalary month always had 27 days. Similarly, within each month, the weeks did not vary in the Greek fashion between 7 and 8 days; instead, the full months had two additional days in their first week and the other three weeks of every month ran for 8 days (\"nine\" by Roman reckoning).<ref name=momma>{{harvp|Mommsen & al.|1864|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n244/mode/2up 219]}}.</ref> Still more unusually, the intercalary month was not placed at the end of the year but ''within'' the month of February after the [[Terminalia]] on the 23rd (''{{lang|la|{{linktext|a.d.}} {{linktext|VII}} {{linktext|Kal.}} {{linktext|Mart.}}}}''); the remaining days of February followed its completion.

By Roman [[inclusive counting]], they were reckoned as \"ninth days\" although they actually occurred every eighth day. Because the republican and Julian years were not evenly divisible into eight-day periods, [[fasti|Roman calendars]] included a column giving every day of the year a [[nundinal letter]] from A to H marking its place in the cycle of market days. Each year, the letter used for the markets would shift 2\u20135 letters along the cycle. As a day when the city swelled with rural [[plebeians]], they were overseen by the [[aedile]]s and took on an important role in Roman legislation, which was supposed to be announced for three nundinal weeks (between 17 and 24 days) in advance of its coming to a vote. The [[patricians]] and their [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]] sometimes exploited this fact as a kind of [[filibuster]], since the [[tribunes of the plebs]] were required to wait another three-week period if their proposals could not receive a vote before dusk on the day they were introduced. Superstitions arose concerning the bad luck that followed a nundinae on the nones of a month or, later, on the [[January Kalends|first day]] of [[January (Roman month)|January]]. Intercalation was supposedly used to avoid such coincidences, even after the Julian reform of the calendar.\n\nThe [[7-day week]] began to be observed in [[Roman Italy|Italy]] in the early imperial period,{{sfnp|Brind'Amour|1983|pp=256\u2013275}} as practitioners and converts to eastern religions introduced [[planetary hours|Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology]], the [[Judaism in ancient Rome|Jewish]] [[Saturday]] [[Jewish sabbath|sabbath]], and the [[Christianity in ancient Rome|Christian]] [[Lord's Day]]. The system was originally used for private worship and astrology but had replaced the nundinal week by the time [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] made [[Sunday]] (''{{lang|la|dies Solis}}'') an official day of rest in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;321. The hebdomadal week was also reckoned as a cycle of letters from A to G; these were adapted for Christian use as the [[dominical letter]]s.\n\n==Months==\nThe names of Roman months originally functioned as adjectives (e.g., the January kalends occur in the January month) before being treated as substantive nouns in their own right (e.g., the kalends of January occur in January).

For example, March 19 was expressed as \"the 14th day before the April Kalends\" (''{{lang|la|a.d. XIV Kal. Apr.}}''), without a mention of March itself. The day after a kalends, nones, or ides was also often expressed as the \"day after\" (''{{lang|la|postridie}}'') owing to their special status as particularly unlucky \"black days\".\n\nThe anomalous status of the new 31-day months under the Julian calendar was an effect of Caesar's desire to avoid affecting the [[Roman festivals|festivals]] tied to the nones and ides of various months. However, because the dates at the ends of the month all counted forward to the next kalends, they were all shifted by one or two days by the change. This created confusion with regard to certain anniversaries. For instance, [[Augustus]]'s birthday on the 23rd day of September was ''{{lang|la|a.d. VIII Kal. Oct.}}'' in the old calendar but ''{{lang|la|a.d. IX Kal. Oct.}}'' under the new system. The ambiguity caused honorary festivals to be held on either or both dates.\n\n==Intercalation==\n{{main|Mercedonius}}\nThe Republican calendar only had 355 days, which meant that it would quickly unsynchronize from the solar year, causing, for example, agricultural festivals to occur out of season. The Roman solution to this problem was to periodically lengthen the calendar by adding [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra days]] ''within'' February. February was broken into two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the [[Terminalia]] on the 23rd (''{{lang|la|a.d. VII Kal. Mart.}}''), which was considered the end of the religious year; the five remaining days beginning with the [[Regifugium]] on the 24th (''{{lang|la|a.d. VI Kal. Mart.}}'') formed the second part; and the intercalary month [[Mercedonius]] was inserted between them. In such years, the days between the ides and the Regifugium were counted down to either the Intercalary Kalends or to the Terminalia. The intercalary month counted down to nones and ides on its 5th and 13th day in the manner of the other short months. The remaining days of the month counted down towards the March Kalends, so that the end of Mercedonius and the second part of February were indistinguishable to the Romans, one ending on ''{{lang|la|a.d. VII Kal. Mart.}}'' and the other picking up at ''{{lang|la|a.d. VI Kal. Mart.}}'' and bearing the normal festivals of such dates.\n\nApparently because of the confusion of these changes or uncertainty as to whether an intercalary month would be ordered, dates after the February ides are attested as sometimes counting down towards the [[Quirinalia]] (Feb. 17), the [[Feralia]] (Feb. 21), or [[Terminalia]] (Feb. 23)<ref>A 94{{nbsp|bc}} inscription.{{which|date=March 2017}}</ref> rather than the intercalary or March kalends. \n\nThe third-century writer Censorinus says:\n\n<blockquote>When it was thought necessary to add (every two years) an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural (solar) year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia [23rd] and Regifugium [24th].<ref>Censorinus, ''The Natal Day'', 20.28, tr. William Maude, New York 1900, available at [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html].</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe fifth-century writer Macrobius says that the Romans intercalated 22 and 23 days in alternate years (''Saturnalia'', 1.13.12); the intercalation was placed after 23 February and the remaining five days of February followed (''Saturnalia'', 1.13.15). To avoid the nones falling on a nundine, where necessary an intercalary day was inserted \"in the middle of the Terminalia, where they placed the intercalary month\".{{sfnp|Macrobius|loc=Book I, Ch. 13, \u00a716, 19}}\n\nThis is historically correct. In 167 BC [[Mercedonius|Intercalaris]] began on the day after 23 February <ref>Livy 45.44.3.</ref> and in 170 BC it began on the second day after 23 February.<ref>Livy 43.11.13.</ref> [[Varro]], writing in the first century BC, says \"the twelfth month was February, and when intercalations take place the five last days of this month are removed.\"<ref>Varro, ''On the Latin language'', 6.13, tr. Roland Kent, London 1938, available at [https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus-data/L333.pdf].</ref> Since all the days after the Ides of Intercalaris were counted down to the beginning of March Intercalaris had either 27 days (making 377 for the year) or 28 (making 378 for the year).\n\nThere is another theory which says that in intercalary years February had 23 or 24 days and Intercalaris had 27. No date is offered for the Regifugium in 378-day years.{{sfnp|Michels|1967}} Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days. This refinement brings the calendar back in line with the seasons, and averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\n\nThe Pontifex Maximus determined when an intercalary month was to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: the first time was during and after the [[Second Punic War]]. It led to the reform of the 191&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} [[Lex Acilia de Intercalando|Acilian Law on Intercalation]], the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown was in the middle of the first century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected [[Magistratus ordinarii / extraordinarii|Roman magistrates]] was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.\n\nAlthough there are many stories to interpret the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always \u00be synodic month. Obviously, the month beginning shifts forward (from the new moon, to the third quarter, to the full moon, to the first quarter, back the new moon) after intercalation.\n\n==Years==\n[[File:Kalender.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fragment of an imperial [[list of Roman consuls|consular list]]<ref>[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] I, CIL VI.</ref>]]\n{{main|list of Roman consuls}}\nAs mentioned above, Rome's legendary 10-month calendar notionally lasted for 304 days but was usually thought to make up the rest of the [[solar year]] during an unorganized winter period. The unattested but almost certain lunar year and the pre-Julian civil year were 354 or 355 days long, with the difference from the solar year more or less corrected by an irregular intercalary month. The [[Julian calendar|Julian year]] was 365 days long, with a [[leap day]] doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian system]].\n\nThe [[calendar era]] before and under the [[Roman kingdom|Roman king]]s is uncertain but dating by [[regnal year]]s was common in antiquity. Under the [[Roman Republic]], from 509{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, years were most commonly described in terms of their reigning [[Roman consul|ordinary consuls]].<ref name=matlock/> ([[Suffect consul|Temporary]] and honorary consuls were sometimes elected or appointed but were not used in dating.)<ref name=matlock/> [[List of Roman consuls|Consular lists]] were displayed on the [[fasti|public calendars]]. After the institution of the [[Roman Empire]], regnal dates based on the emperors' terms in office became more common. Some historians of the later republic and early imperial eras dated from the legendary founding of the city of Rome (''{{lang|la|[[ab urbe condita]]}}'' or {{sc|avc}}).<ref name=matlock/> [[Varro]]'s date for this was 753{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} but other writers used different dates, varying by several decades.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Such dating was, however, never widespread. After the consuls waned in importance, most Roman dating was regnal<ref name=matchlock>{{harvp|Mathieson|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=krcp3GU2MssC&pg=PA15 15]}}.</ref> or followed [[Diocletian]]'s 15-year [[Indiction]] tax cycle.<ref name=matlock/> These cycles were not distinguished, however, so that \"year 2 of the indiction\" may refer to any of 298, 313, 328, &c.<ref name=matlock/> The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] subjects of the [[Byzantine Empire]] used various Christian eras, including [[Anno Martyrum|those based on Diocletian's persecutions]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Christ's incarnation]], and [[Anno Mundi|the supposed age of the world]].\n\nThe Romans did not have records of their early calendars but, like modern historians, assumed the year originally began in March on the basis of the names of the months following June. The consul [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior|M. Fulvius Nobilior]] (r.{{nbsp}}189{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) wrote a commentary on the calendar at the Temple of Hercules Musarum that claimed January had been named for [[Janus (god)|Janus]] because the god faced both ways,{{sfnp|Varro}}{{where|date=April 2017}} suggesting it had been instituted as a first month.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It was, however, usually said to have been instituted along with February, whose nature and festivals suggest it had originally been considered the last month of the year. The consuls' term of office\u2014and thus the order of the years under the republic\u2014seems to have changed several times. Their inaugurations were finally moved to [[1 January|1{{nbsp}}January]] (''{{lang|la|Kal. Ian.}}'') in 153{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to allow [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior|Q. Fulvius Nobilior]] to attack [[Segeda]] in [[Prehistoric Spain|Spain]] during the [[Celtiberian Wars]], before which they had occurred on [[15 March|15{{nbsp}}March]] (''{{lang|la|[[Ides of March|Eid. Mart]].}}'').{{sfnp|Livy|loc=Book XLVII}} There is reason to believe the inauguration date had been [[1 May|1{{nbsp}}May]] during the {{nowrap|3rd century {{sc|bc}}}} until 222{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and [[Livy]] mentions earlier inaugurations on 15{{nbsp}}May (''{{lang|la|Eid. Mai.}}''), 1{{nbsp}}July (''{{lang|la|Kal. Qui.}}''), 1{{nbsp}}August (''{{lang|la|Kal. Sex.}}''), 1{{nbsp}}October (''{{lang|la|Kal. Oct.}}''), and 15{{nbsp}}December (''{{lang|la|Eid. Dec.}}'').{{sfnp|Livy}}{{where|date=April 2017}} Under the Julian calendar, the year began on 1{{nbsp}}January but years of the [[Indiction]] cycle began on 1{{nbsp}}September.\n\nIn addition to [[Egyptian calendar|Egypt's separate calendar]], some provinces maintained their records using a local era.<ref name=matlock/> [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] dated its records sequentially from 39{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}};<ref name=matchlock/> [[Roman Spain|Spain]] from {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}38.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This dating system continued as the [[Spanish era]] used in [[medieval Spain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Conversion to Julian or Gregorian dates==\nThe continuity of names from the Roman to the [[Gregorian calendar]] can lead to the mistaken belief that Roman dates correspond to Julian or Gregorian ones. In fact, the essentially complete [[list of Roman consuls]] allows general certainty of years back to [[expulsion of Tarquin|the establishment]] of the [[Roman Republic|republic]] but the uncertainty as to the end of lunar dating and the irregularity of Roman intercalation means that dates which can be independently verified are invariably weeks to months outside of their \"proper\" place. Two astronomical events dated by [[Livy]] show the calendar 4 months out of alignment with the Julian date in 190{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and 2 months out of alignment in 168{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Thus, \"the year of the consulship of [[Publius Cornelius Sciopio Africanus]] and [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius Crassus]]\" (usually given as \"205{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}\") actually began on 15{{nbsp}}March 205{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and ended on 14{{nbsp}}March 204{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} according to the Roman calendar but may have begun as early as November or December 206{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} owing to its misalignment. Even following the establishment of the [[Julian calendar]], the leap years were not applied correctly by the Roman priests, meaning dates are a few days out of their \"proper\" place until a few decades into Augustus's reign.\n\nGiven the paucity of records regarding the state of the calendar and its intercalation, historians have reconstructed the correspondence of Roman dates to their Julian and Gregorian equivalents from disparate sources. There are detailed accounts of the decades leading up to the Julian reform, particularly the speeches and letters of [[Cicero]], which permit an established chronology back to about 58{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. The [[nundinal cycle]] and a few known synchronisms\u2014e.g., a Roman date in terms of the [[Attic calendar]] and [[Olympiad]]\u2014are used to generate contested chronologies back to the start of the [[First Punic War]] in 264{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Beyond that, dates are roughly known based on clues such as the dates of [[harvest]]s and seasonal [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of calendars]]\n* [[Julian calendar|Julian]], [[Alexandrian calendar|Alexandrian]], [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine]], & [[Gregorian calendar]]s\n* [[List of Roman consuls]] and ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' dating\n* [[General Roman Calendar]] of the Catholic Church\n* [[Roman festivals]]\n* [[Undecimber]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation |last=Beck |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clMQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=Latin Syntax, Chiefly from the German of C.G.

The term often includes the [[Julian calendar]] established by the reforms of the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Roman emperor|emperor]] [[Augustus]] in the late 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and sometimes includes any system dated by [[inclusive counting]] towards months' [[kalends]], [[nones (calendar)|nones]], and [[ides (calendar)|ides]] in the Roman manner. The term usually excludes the [[Alexandrian calendar]] of [[Roman Egypt]], which continued the unique months of that land's [[Egyptian calendar|former calendar]]; the [[Byzantine calendar]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|later Roman Empire]], which usually dated the Roman months in the simple count of the [[ancient Greek calendar]]s; and the [[Gregorian calendar]], which refined the Julian system to bring it into still closer alignment with the [[tropical year]].\n\nRoman dates were [[inclusive counting|counted inclusively]] forward to the next of three principal days: the first of the month (the kalends), a day shortly before the middle of the month (the ides), and eight days\u2014nine, counting inclusively\u2014before this (the nones). The original calendar consisted of ten months beginning in spring with [[March]]; winter was left as an unassigned span of days. These months ran for 38 [[nundinae|nundinal]] cycles, each forming an eight-day [[week]] (nine days [[inclusive counting|counted inclusively]], hence the name) ended by religious rituals and a public market. The winter period was later divided into two months, [[Ianuarius|January]] and [[Februarius|February]]. The [[Roman legend|legendary]] [[list of kings of Rome|early kings]] [[Romulus]] and [[Numa Pompilius]] were traditionally credited with establishing this early fixed calendar, which bears traces of its origin as an observational [[lunar calendar|lunar one]]. In particular, the kalends, nones, and ides seem to have derived from the first sighting of the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]], the [[first-quarter moon]], and the [[full moon]] respectively. The system ran well short of the solar year, and it needed constant [[wikt:intercalation|intercalation]] to keep [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and other activities in their proper [[season]]s. This is a typical element of [[lunisolar calendar]]s. For superstitious reasons, such intercalation occurred within the month of February even after it was no longer considered the last month.\n\nAfter the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy|establishment]] of the [[Roman Republic]], years began to be dated by [[Roman consul|consulships]] and control over intercalation was granted to the [[pontifex maximus|pontifices]], who eventually abused their power by lengthening years controlled by their political allies and shortening the years in their rivals' terms of office. Having won [[Caesar's civil war|his war]] with [[Pompey the Great|Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] used his position as Rome's [[pontifex maximus|chief pontiff]] to enact a [[Julian reform|calendar reform]] in 46{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, coincidentally making the year of his third consulship last for 446 days. In order to avoid interfering with Rome's religious ceremonies, the reform added all its days towards the ends of months and did not adjust any nones or ides, even in months which came to have 31 days. The Julian calendar was supposed to have a single [[leap day]] on [[February 24|24 February]] (a doubled ''{{lang|la|VI {{linktext|Kal.}} {{linktext|Mart.}}}}'') every fourth year but following [[Assassination of Caesar|Caesar's assassination]] the priests figured this using inclusive counting and mistakenly added the bissextile day every three years. In order to bring the calendar back to its proper place, [[Augustus]] was obliged to suspend intercalation for one or two decades. The revised calendar remained slightly longer than the solar year; by the 16th century the date of [[Easter]] had shifted so far away from the [[vernal equinox]] that [[Pope Gregory&nbsp;XIII]] ordered the calendar\u2019s adjustment, resulting in the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fasti Praenestini Massimo n1.jpg|thumb|The remains of the ''{{lang|la|[[Fasti Praenestini]]}}'']]\n{{anchor|Lunar|Lunar calendar|Prehistory}}\n===Prehistoric lunar calendar===\nThe original Roman [[calendar]] is believed to have been an observational [[lunar calendar]]{{sfnp|Mommsen & al.|1864|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n242/mode/2up 216]}} whose months began from the first signs of a new crescent moon. Because a [[lunar phase|lunar cycle]] is about {{frac|29|1|2}} days long, such months would have varied between 29 and 30 days. Twelve such months would have fallen 10 or 11 days short of the [[solar year]]; without adjustment, such a year would have quickly rotated out of alignment with the seasons in the manner of the [[Islamic calendar]]. Given the seasonal aspects of the later calendar and its associated religious festivals, this was presumably avoided through some form of [[wikt: intercalation|intercalation]] or the suspension of the calendar during winter.\n\nRome's 8-day week, the [[nundinal cycle]], was shared with the [[Etruscans]], who used it as the schedule of royal audiences. It was presumably a part of the early calendar and was credited in [[Roman legend]] variously to [[Romulus]] and [[Servius Tullius]].\n\n{{anchor|Romulus|Romulan calendar|Calendar of Romulus}}\n\n===Legendary 10&nbsp;month calendar===\nThe Romans themselves described their first organized year as one with ten fixed months, each of 30 or 31&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Macrobius|loc=Book I, Ch. 12, \u00a73}}{{sfnp|Kaster|2011|p=137}} Such a decimal division fitted general Roman practice.{{sfnp|Mommsen & al.|1864|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n242/mode/2up 217]}} The four 31&nbsp;day months were called \"full\" (''{{lang|la|[[wikt:pleni menses#Latin|pleni]]}}'') and the others \"hollow\" (''{{lang|la|[[wikt:cavi menses#Latin|cavi]]}}'').<ref>[[Censorinus]], [[Macrobius]], and [[Solinus]], cited in {{harvp|Key|1875}}</ref><ref name=mommy>{{harvp|Mommsen & al.|1864|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n244/mode/2up 218]}}.</ref> Its 304&nbsp;days made up exactly 38&nbsp;[[nundinal cycle]]s.

Instead, their 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 10th months{{efn|That is, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 8th months before the introduction and repositioning of January and February.}} had 31 days each; all the other months had 29 days except February, which had 28 days for three years and then 29 every fourth year. The total of these months over 4 years differed from the Greeks by 5 days, meaning the Roman intercalary month always had 27 days. Similarly, within each month, the weeks did not vary in the Greek fashion between 7 and 8 days; instead, the full months had two additional days in their first week and the other three weeks of every month ran for 8 days (\"nine\" by Roman reckoning).<ref name=momma>{{harvp|Mommsen & al.|1864|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyrome00dickgoog#page/n244/mode/2up 219]}}.</ref> Still more unusually, the intercalary month was not placed at the end of the year but ''within'' the month of February after the [[Terminalia]] on the 23rd (''{{lang|la|{{linktext|a.d.}} {{linktext|VII}} {{linktext|Kal.}} {{linktext|Mart.}}}}''); the remaining days of February followed its completion.

The public Roman calendars were the ''[[fasti]]'', which designated the religious and legal character of each month's days. The Romans marked each day of such calendars with the letters:{{sfnp|Scullard|1981|pp=44\u201345}}\n\n* '''F''' (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fasti|fastus]]'', \"permissible\") on days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law (''{{lang|la|dies fasti}}'', \"allowed days\")\n* '''C''' (''comitialis'') on ''fasti'' days during which the Roman people could hold [[Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic|assemblies]] (''{{lang|la|dies comitiales}}'')\n* '''N''' (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#nefastus|nefastus]]'') on days when political and judicial activities were prohibited (''{{lang|la|dies nefasti}}'')\n* '''NP''' (uncertain){{efn|The NP days are sometimes thought to mark days when political and judicial activities were prohibited only until [[noon]], standing for ''{{lang|la|nefastus priore}}''.}} on public holidays (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'')\n* '''QRCF''' (uncertain){{efn|The QRCF days are sometimes supposed, on the basis of the ''Fasti Viae Lanza'' which gives it as ''{{lang|la|Q.

By Roman [[inclusive counting]], they were reckoned as \"ninth days\" although they actually occurred every eighth day. Because the republican and Julian years were not evenly divisible into eight-day periods, [[fasti|Roman calendars]] included a column giving every day of the year a [[nundinal letter]] from A to H marking its place in the cycle of market days. Each year, the letter used for the markets would shift 2\u20135 letters along the cycle. As a day when the city swelled with rural [[plebeians]], they were overseen by the [[aedile]]s and took on an important role in Roman legislation, which was supposed to be announced for three nundinal weeks (between 17 and 24 days) in advance of its coming to a vote. The [[patricians]] and their [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]] sometimes exploited this fact as a kind of [[filibuster]], since the [[tribunes of the plebs]] were required to wait another three-week period if their proposals could not receive a vote before dusk on the day they were introduced. Superstitions arose concerning the bad luck that followed a nundinae on the nones of a month or, later, on the [[January Kalends|first day]] of [[January (Roman month)|January]]. Intercalation was supposedly used to avoid such coincidences, even after the Julian reform of the calendar.\n\nThe [[7-day week]] began to be observed in [[Roman Italy|Italy]] in the early imperial period,{{sfnp|Brind'Amour|1983|pp=256\u2013275}} as practitioners and converts to eastern religions introduced [[planetary hours|Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology]], the [[Judaism in ancient Rome|Jewish]] [[Saturday]] [[Jewish sabbath|sabbath]], and the [[Christianity in ancient Rome|Christian]] [[Lord's Day]]. The system was originally used for private worship and astrology but had replaced the nundinal week by the time [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] made [[Sunday]] (''{{lang|la|dies Solis}}'') an official day of rest in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;321. The hebdomadal week was also reckoned as a cycle of letters from A to G; these were adapted for Christian use as the [[dominical letter]]s.\n\n==Months==\nThe names of Roman months originally functioned as adjectives (e.g., the January kalends occur in the January month) before being treated as substantive nouns in their own right (e.g., the kalends of January occur in January). Some of their etymologies are well-established: January and March honor the gods [[Janus (god)|Janus]]<ref>{{citation |contribution=January, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> and [[Mars (god)|Mars]];<ref>{{citation |contribution=March, ''n.<small><sup>2</sup></small>'' |title=OED }}.</ref> July and August honor the [[dictator (Rome)|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]]<ref>{{citation |contribution=July, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> and his successor, the [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Augustus]];<ref>{{citation |contribution=August, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> and the months Quintilis,<ref>{{citation |contribution=\u2020quintile, ''n.<sup><small>2</small></sup>'' |title=OED }}.</ref> Sextilis,<ref>{{citation |contribution=sextile, ''adj.'' and ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> September,<ref name=septime>{{citation |contribution=September, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> October,<ref>{{citation |contribution=October, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> November,<ref>{{citation |contribution=November, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> and December<ref>{{citation |contribution=December, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> are archaic adjectives formed from the [[ordinal numeral|ordinal number]]s from 5 to 10, their position in the calendar when it began around the spring equinox in March.<ref name=septime/> Others are uncertain. February may derive from the Februa festival or its eponymous ''{{lang|la|februa}}'' (\"purifications, expiatory offerings\"), whose name may be either [[Sabine language|Sabine]] or preserve an archaic word for [[sulphur]]ic.<ref>{{citation |contribution=February, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> April may relate to the [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] goddess Apru or the verb ''{{lang|la|aperire}}'' (\"to open\").{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} May and June may honor [[Maia (goddess)|Maia]]<ref>{{citation |contribution=May, ''n.<sup><small>2</small></sup>'' |title=OED }}.</ref> and [[Juno (goddess)|Juno]]<ref>{{citation |contribution=June, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.</ref> or derive from archaic terms for \"senior\" and \"junior\". A few [[list of Roman emperors|emperors]] attempted to add themselves to the calendar after Augustus, but without enduring success.\n\nIn classical Latin, the days of each month were usually reckoned as:<ref name=perdedor/>\n\n<center>\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

For example, March 19 was expressed as \"the 14th day before the April Kalends\" (''{{lang|la|a.d. XIV Kal. Apr.}}''), without a mention of March itself. The day after a kalends, nones, or ides was also often expressed as the \"day after\" (''{{lang|la|postridie}}'') owing to their special status as particularly unlucky \"black days\".\n\nThe anomalous status of the new 31-day months under the Julian calendar was an effect of Caesar's desire to avoid affecting the [[Roman festivals|festivals]] tied to the nones and ides of various months. However, because the dates at the ends of the month all counted forward to the next kalends, they were all shifted by one or two days by the change. This created confusion with regard to certain anniversaries. For instance, [[Augustus]]'s birthday on the 23rd day of September was ''{{lang|la|a.d. VIII Kal. Oct.}}'' in the old calendar but ''{{lang|la|a.d. IX Kal. Oct.}}'' under the new system. The ambiguity caused honorary festivals to be held on either or both dates.\n\n==Intercalation==\n{{main|Mercedonius}}\nThe Republican calendar only had 355 days, which meant that it would quickly unsynchronize from the solar year, causing, for example, agricultural festivals to occur out of season. The Roman solution to this problem was to periodically lengthen the calendar by adding [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra days]] ''within'' February. February was broken into two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the [[Terminalia]] on the 23rd (''{{lang|la|a.d. VII Kal. Mart.}}''), which was considered the end of the religious year; the five remaining days beginning with the [[Regifugium]] on the 24th (''{{lang|la|a.d. VI Kal. Mart.}}'') formed the second part; and the intercalary month [[Mercedonius]] was inserted between them. In such years, the days between the ides and the Regifugium were counted down to either the Intercalary Kalends or to the Terminalia. The intercalary month counted down to nones and ides on its 5th and 13th day in the manner of the other short months. The remaining days of the month counted down towards the March Kalends, so that the end of Mercedonius and the second part of February were indistinguishable to the Romans, one ending on ''{{lang|la|a.d. VII Kal. Mart.}}'' and the other picking up at ''{{lang|la|a.d. VI Kal. Mart.}}'' and bearing the normal festivals of such dates.\n\nApparently because of the confusion of these changes or uncertainty as to whether an intercalary month would be ordered, dates after the February ides are attested as sometimes counting down towards the [[Quirinalia]] (Feb. 17), the [[Feralia]] (Feb. 21), or [[Terminalia]] (Feb. 23)<ref>A 94{{nbsp|bc}} inscription.{{which|date=March 2017}}</ref> rather than the intercalary or March kalends. \n\nThe third-century writer Censorinus says:\n\n<blockquote>When it was thought necessary to add (every two years) an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural (solar) year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia [23rd] and Regifugium [24th].<ref>Censorinus, ''The Natal Day'', 20.28, tr. William Maude, New York 1900, available at [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html].</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe fifth-century writer Macrobius says that the Romans intercalated 22 and 23 days in alternate years (''Saturnalia'', 1.13.12); the intercalation was placed after 23 February and the remaining five days of February followed (''Saturnalia'', 1.13.15). To avoid the nones falling on a nundine, where necessary an intercalary day was inserted \"in the middle of the Terminalia, where they placed the intercalary month\".{{sfnp|Macrobius|loc=Book I, Ch. 13, \u00a716, 19}}\n\nThis is historically correct. In 167 BC [[Mercedonius|Intercalaris]] began on the day after 23 February <ref>Livy 45.44.3.</ref> and in 170 BC it began on the second day after 23 February.<ref>Livy 43.11.13.</ref> [[Varro]], writing in the first century BC, says \"the twelfth month was February, and when intercalations take place the five last days of this month are removed.\"<ref>Varro, ''On the Latin language'', 6.13, tr. Roland Kent, London 1938, available at [https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus-data/L333.pdf].</ref> Since all the days after the Ides of Intercalaris were counted down to the beginning of March Intercalaris had either 27 days (making 377 for the year) or 28 (making 378 for the year).\n\nThere is another theory which says that in intercalary years February had 23 or 24 days and Intercalaris had 27. No date is offered for the Regifugium in 378-day years.{{sfnp|Michels|1967}} Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days. This refinement brings the calendar back in line with the seasons, and averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\n\nThe Pontifex Maximus determined when an intercalary month was to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: the first time was during and after the [[Second Punic War]]. It led to the reform of the 191&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} [[Lex Acilia de Intercalando|Acilian Law on Intercalation]], the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown was in the middle of the first century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected [[Magistratus ordinarii / extraordinarii|Roman magistrates]] was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.\n\nAlthough there are many stories to interpret the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always \u00be synodic month. Obviously, the month beginning shifts forward (from the new moon, to the third quarter, to the full moon, to the first quarter, back the new moon) after intercalation.\n\n==Years==\n[[File:Kalender.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fragment of an imperial [[list of Roman consuls|consular list]]<ref>[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] I, CIL VI.</ref>]]\n{{main|list of Roman consuls}}\nAs mentioned above, Rome's legendary 10-month calendar notionally lasted for 304 days but was usually thought to make up the rest of the [[solar year]] during an unorganized winter period. The unattested but almost certain lunar year and the pre-Julian civil year were 354 or 355 days long, with the difference from the solar year more or less corrected by an irregular intercalary month. The [[Julian calendar|Julian year]] was 365 days long, with a [[leap day]] doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian system]].\n\nThe [[calendar era]] before and under the [[Roman kingdom|Roman king]]s is uncertain but dating by [[regnal year]]s was common in antiquity. Under the [[Roman Republic]], from 509{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, years were most commonly described in terms of their reigning [[Roman consul|ordinary consuls]].<ref name=matlock/> ([[Suffect consul|Temporary]] and honorary consuls were sometimes elected or appointed but were not used in dating.)<ref name=matlock/> [[List of Roman consuls|Consular lists]] were displayed on the [[fasti|public calendars]]. After the institution of the [[Roman Empire]], regnal dates based on the emperors' terms in office became more common. Some historians of the later republic and early imperial eras dated from the legendary founding of the city of Rome (''{{lang|la|[[ab urbe condita]]}}'' or {{sc|avc}}).<ref name=matlock/> [[Varro]]'s date for this was 753{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} but other writers used different dates, varying by several decades.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Such dating was, however, never widespread. After the consuls waned in importance, most Roman dating was regnal<ref name=matchlock>{{harvp|Mathieson|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=krcp3GU2MssC&pg=PA15 15]}}.</ref> or followed [[Diocletian]]'s 15-year [[Indiction]] tax cycle.<ref name=matlock/> These cycles were not distinguished, however, so that \"year 2 of the indiction\" may refer to any of 298, 313, 328, &c.<ref name=matlock/> The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] subjects of the [[Byzantine Empire]] used various Christian eras, including [[Anno Martyrum|those based on Diocletian's persecutions]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Christ's incarnation]], and [[Anno Mundi|the supposed age of the world]].\n\nThe Romans did not have records of their early calendars but, like modern historians, assumed the year originally began in March on the basis of the names of the months following June. The consul [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior|M. Fulvius Nobilior]] (r.{{nbsp}}189{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) wrote a commentary on the calendar at the Temple of Hercules Musarum that claimed January had been named for [[Janus (god)|Janus]] because the god faced both ways,{{sfnp|Varro}}{{where|date=April 2017}} suggesting it had been instituted as a first month.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It was, however, usually said to have been instituted along with February, whose nature and festivals suggest it had originally been considered the last month of the year. The consuls' term of office\u2014and thus the order of the years under the republic\u2014seems to have changed several times. Their inaugurations were finally moved to [[1 January|1{{nbsp}}January]] (''{{lang|la|Kal. Ian.}}'') in 153{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to allow [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior|Q. Fulvius Nobilior]] to attack [[Segeda]] in [[Prehistoric Spain|Spain]] during the [[Celtiberian Wars]], before which they had occurred on [[15 March|15{{nbsp}}March]] (''{{lang|la|[[Ides of March|Eid. Mart]].}}'').{{sfnp|Livy|loc=Book XLVII}} There is reason to believe the inauguration date had been [[1 May|1{{nbsp}}May]] during the {{nowrap|3rd century {{sc|bc}}}} until 222{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and [[Livy]] mentions earlier inaugurations on 15{{nbsp}}May (''{{lang|la|Eid. Mai.}}''), 1{{nbsp}}July (''{{lang|la|Kal. Qui.}}''), 1{{nbsp}}August (''{{lang|la|Kal. Sex.}}''), 1{{nbsp}}October (''{{lang|la|Kal. Oct.}}''), and 15{{nbsp}}December (''{{lang|la|Eid. Dec.}}'').{{sfnp|Livy}}{{where|date=April 2017}} Under the Julian calendar, the year began on 1{{nbsp}}January but years of the [[Indiction]] cycle began on 1{{nbsp}}September.\n\nIn addition to [[Egyptian calendar|Egypt's separate calendar]], some provinces maintained their records using a local era.<ref name=matlock/> [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] dated its records sequentially from 39{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}};<ref name=matchlock/> [[Roman Spain|Spain]] from {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}38.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This dating system continued as the [[Spanish era]] used in [[medieval Spain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Conversion to Julian or Gregorian dates==\nThe continuity of names from the Roman to the [[Gregorian calendar]] can lead to the mistaken belief that Roman dates correspond to Julian or Gregorian ones. In fact, the essentially complete [[list of Roman consuls]] allows general certainty of years back to [[expulsion of Tarquin|the establishment]] of the [[Roman Republic|republic]] but the uncertainty as to the end of lunar dating and the irregularity of Roman intercalation means that dates which can be independently verified are invariably weeks to months outside of their \"proper\" place. Two astronomical events dated by [[Livy]] show the calendar 4 months out of alignment with the Julian date in 190{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and 2 months out of alignment in 168{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Thus, \"the year of the consulship of [[Publius Cornelius Sciopio Africanus]] and [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius Crassus]]\" (usually given as \"205{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}\") actually began on 15{{nbsp}}March 205{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and ended on 14{{nbsp}}March 204{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} according to the Roman calendar but may have begun as early as November or December 206{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} owing to its misalignment. Even following the establishment of the [[Julian calendar]], the leap years were not applied correctly by the Roman priests, meaning dates are a few days out of their \"proper\" place until a few decades into Augustus's reign.\n\nGiven the paucity of records regarding the state of the calendar and its intercalation, historians have reconstructed the correspondence of Roman dates to their Julian and Gregorian equivalents from disparate sources. There are detailed accounts of the decades leading up to the Julian reform, particularly the speeches and letters of [[Cicero]], which permit an established chronology back to about 58{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. The [[nundinal cycle]] and a few known synchronisms\u2014e.g., a Roman date in terms of the [[Attic calendar]] and [[Olympiad]]\u2014are used to generate contested chronologies back to the start of the [[First Punic War]] in 264{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Beyond that, dates are roughly known based on clues such as the dates of [[harvest]]s and seasonal [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of calendars]]\n* [[Julian calendar|Julian]], [[Alexandrian calendar|Alexandrian]], [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine]], & [[Gregorian calendar]]s\n* [[List of Roman consuls]] and ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' dating\n* [[General Roman Calendar]] of the Catholic Church\n* [[Roman festivals]]\n* [[Undecimber]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation |last=Beck |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clMQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=Latin Syntax, Chiefly from the German of C.G.

Today, as its name suggests, it is published quarterly.<ref name=\"WP 2013\" />\n\nWhen Peter Braestrup left the magazine in 1989 to join Billington at the [[Library of Congress]], he was succeeded by Jay Tolson, the magazine's literary editor. Tolson added a successful poetry section designed to introduce readers to significant poets of the past and present. The section was initially co-edited by [[Joseph Brodsky]] and poet laureate [[Anthony Hecht]].\n\nThe magazine continued to focus on public questions, exemplified by the 1998 cluster \"Is Everything Relative?\" with articles by [[E.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;Wilson]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Paul R.

By 1950 punched cards had become ubiquitous in industry and government. \"Do not fold, [[Spindle (stationery)|spindle]] or mutilate,\" a warning that appeared on some punched cards distributed as documents such as checks and utility bills to be returned for processing, became a motto for the post-[[World War II]] era.<ref>Lubar, Steven, 1991, ''Do Not Fold, Spindle or Mutilate: A Cultural History of the Punch Card'', Smithsonian Institution</ref><!--- parts of this paragraph copied from [[History of computing hardware#801: punched card technology]] ---><ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/tutorial/history-of-the-punch-card.html |title=History of the punch card |publisher=Whatis.techtarget.com |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955 IBM signed a [[consent decree]] requiring, amongst other things, that IBM would by 1962 have no more than one-half of the punched card manufacturing capacity in the United States.

The card shown in {{US patent|src=uspto|395781}} of January 8 was printed with a template and had hole positions arranged close to the edges so they could be reached by a [[railroad conductor]]'s [[ticket punch]], with the center reserved for written descriptions. Hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let the conductor encode a rough description of the passenger:\n\n: \"I was traveling in the West and I had a ticket with what I think was called a punch photograph...the conductor...punched out a description of the individual, as light hair, dark eyes, large nose, etc. So you see, I only made a punch photograph of each person.\"<ref>(Austrian 1982, p.15)</ref>\n\nWhen use of the ticket punch proved tiring and error prone Hollerith developed the [[pantograph]] \"keyboard punch\".

His tabulating machine had up to 40 counters, each with a dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution.

By 1950 punched cards had become ubiquitous in industry and government. \"Do not fold, [[Spindle (stationery)|spindle]] or mutilate,\" a warning that appeared on some punched cards distributed as documents such as checks and utility bills to be returned for processing, became a motto for the post-[[World War II]] era.<ref>Lubar, Steven, 1991, ''Do Not Fold, Spindle or Mutilate: A Cultural History of the Punch Card'', Smithsonian Institution</ref><!--- parts of this paragraph copied from [[History of computing hardware#801: punched card technology]] ---><ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/tutorial/history-of-the-punch-card.html |title=History of the punch card |publisher=Whatis.techtarget.com |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955 IBM signed a [[consent decree]] requiring, amongst other things, that IBM would by 1962 have no more than one-half of the punched card manufacturing capacity in the United States.

The terminals that replaced the punched cards, the [[IBM 3270]] for example, displayed 80 [[Characters per line|columns of text]] in [[text mode]], for compatibility with existing software.

These patents described both [[paper tape]] and rectangular cards as possible recording media. The card shown in {{US patent|src=uspto|395781}} of January 8 was printed with a template and had hole positions arranged close to the edges so they could be reached by a [[railroad conductor]]'s [[ticket punch]], with the center reserved for written descriptions. Hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let the conductor encode a rough description of the passenger:\n\n: \"I was traveling in the West and I had a ticket with what I think was called a punch photograph...the conductor...punched out a description of the individual, as light hair, dark eyes, large nose, etc. So you see, I only made a punch photograph of each person.\"<ref>(Austrian 1982, p.15)</ref>\n\nWhen use of the ticket punch proved tiring and error prone Hollerith developed the [[pantograph]] \"keyboard punch\". It featured an enlarged diagram of the card, indicating the positions of the holes to be punched. A printed reading board could be placed under a card that was to be read manually.<ref>(Truesdell 1965, p.43)</ref>\n\nHollerith envisioned a number of card sizes. In an article he wrote describing his proposed system for tabulating the 1890 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census]], Hollerith suggested a card 3&nbsp;inches by 5\u00bd inches of [[Manila paper|Manila stock]] \"would be sufficient to answer all ordinary purposes.\"<ref name=minesquarterly>{{cite journal |last=Hollerith|first=Herman|editor-last=da Cruz|editor-first=Frank|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/hh/index.html#%5B-245-%5D |title=An Electric Tabulating System |journal=The Quarterly |publisher=Columbia University School of Mines |volume=10 |issue=16 |date=April 1889 |page=245}}</ref>  The cards used in the 1890 census had round holes, 12 rows and 24 columns.

His tabulating machine had up to 40 counters, each with a dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution. This arrangement allowed a count up to 9,999.  During a given tabulating run counters were assigned specific holes or, using [[relay logic]], combination of holes.<ref name=minesquarterly/>\n\nLater designs led to a card with ten rows, each row assigned a digit value, 0 through 9, and 45 columns.<ref name = \"Bashe\">{{cite book |last=Bashe |first=Charles J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Lyle R. |last3=Palmer |first3=John H. |last4=Pugh |first4=Emerson W. |title=IBM's Early Computers |publisher=[[The MIT Press]] |year=1986 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=[https://archive.org/details/ibmsearlycompute00bash/page/5 5] |isbn=978-0-262-02225-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/ibmsearlycompute00bash/page/5 }} Also see  pages 5-14 for additional information on punched cards.</ref>  \nThis card provided for fields to record multi-digit numbers that tabulators could sum, instead of their simply counting cards.

[[Thomas J. Watson|Thomas J. Watson Sr.]], IBM\u2019s head, asked two of his top inventors, [[Clair D. Lake]] and [[J.

Lake suggested rectangular holes, which could be spaced more tightly, allowing 80 columns per punched card, thereby nearly doubling the capacity of the older format.<ref>[http://ibm-1401.info/Patent1772492.pdf U.S. Patent 1,772,492, Record Sheet for Tabulating Machines], C.

Data is stored in 6-bit [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]], with three rows of 32 characters each, or 8-bit [[EBCDIC]]. In this format, each column of the top tiers are combined with two punch rows from the bottom tier to form an 8-bit byte, and the middle tier is combined with two more punch rows, so that each card contains 64 bytes of 8-bit-per-byte binary coded data.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Winter\n  | first = Dik T\n  | title = 96-column Punched Card Code\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415041458/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/96col.html\n  | archivedate = April 15, 2007\n  | url = http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/96col.html#start\n  | accessdate = November 6, 2012\n  }}</ref>\n\n===Powers/Remington Rand/UNIVAC 90-column punched card format===\n[[File:RemingtonRandCard.agr.jpg|thumb|left|A blank [[Remington Rand]] [[UNIVAC]] format card.

They had many rights and requests that they pushed to be fulfilled by the Government of Canada. The following is a list of some of the Red River M\u00e9tis' demands for the ''Act''.<ref>Lawrence Barkwell, \u201cMetis Lists of Rights: The Evolution of the List from the First to Fourth Iteration\u201d (Louis Riel Institute).</ref><blockquote>'''Fourth list of rights'''\n\n'''May 9, 1870'''\n\n# That this province be governed:\n## By a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General of Canada;\n## By a Senate;\n## By a Legislature chosen by the people with a responsible ministry.\n# That, until such time as the increase of the population in this country entitle us to a greater number, we have two representatives in the Senate and four in the Commons of Canada.\n# That in entering the Confederation the Province of the Northwest be completely free from the public debt of Canada; and if called upon to assume a part of the said debt of Canada, that it be only after having received from Canada the same amount for which the said Province of the Northwest should be held responsible.\n# That the annual sum of $80,000 be allotted by the Dominion of Canada to the Legislature of the Province of the Northwest.\n# That all properties, rights and privileges enjoyed by us up to this day be respected, and that the recognition and settlement of customs, usages and privileges be left exclusively to the decision of the Local Legislature.\n# That this country be submitted to no direct taxation except such as may be imposed by the local legislature for municipal or other local purposes.\n# That the schools be separate, and that the public money for schools be distributed among the different religious denominations in proportion to their respective populations according to the system of the Province of Quebec.\n# That the determination of the qualifications of members for the parliament of the province or for the parliament of Canada be left to the local legislature.\n# That in this province, with the exception of the Indians, who are neither civilized nor settled, every man having attained the age of 21 years, and every foreigner being a British subject, after having resided three years in this country, and being Possessed of a house, be entitled to vote at the elections for the members of the local legislature and of the Canadian Parliament, and that every foreigner other than a British subject, having resided here during the same period, and being proprietor of a house, be likewise entitled to vote on condition of taking the oath of allegiance.

The ''Act'' also set aside land for the M\u00e9tis, with each family receiving scrip, a certificate, saying they owned 96 hectares of land, amount to a total of about 5{{Spaces|1|thin}}600 km<sup>2</sup>. The number of applications that the government was going to receive was greatly underestimated. The 1.4 million acres of land was not enough for the number of applications. The Canadian government began giving money for land, the equivalent value of $1 per acre, which was the current land value at that time.\n\nSection 31 reads in part:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/metis-scrip/005005-3100-e.html|title=Manitoba Commissions: Claims Under Section 31|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{block quote|And whereas, it is expedient, towards the extinguishment of the Indian Title to the lands in the Province, to appropriate a portion of such ungranted lands, to the extent of one million four hundred thousand acres thereof, for the benefit of the families of the half-breed residents, it is hereby enacted, that, under regulations to be from time to time made by the Governor General in Council, the Lieutenant-Governor shall select such lots or tracts in such parts of the Province as he may deem expedient, to the extent aforesaid, and divide the same among the children of the half-breed heads of families residing in the Province at the time of the said transfer to Canada, and the same shall be granted to the said children respectively, in such mode and on such conditions as to settlement and otherwise. as the Governor General in Council may from time to time determine.|sign=|source=}}\n\n=== Religious and language rights ===\nThe ''Act'' covered an array of topics. It contained religious and language rights.<ref name=\":53\" /> It allowed the M\u00e9tis to have rights to have [[Separate schools|denominational schools]]. The ''Act'' stated that laws had to be written and enforced in both French and English, either English or French can be used in the Legislature of Manitoba and any courts established by either Canada or the Province must use both languages. These have led to political controversy such as the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] in the nineteenth century, as denominational school rights were curtailed. \n\n=== Parliament of Canada ===\nThe ''Act'' also provided for Manitoba to send four members to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and two members to the [[Senate of Canada]].\n\n== Controversies ==\nSince the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' was put into action it has been adjusted and under review multiple times. Historian D. N. Sprague notes that the land assigned to the [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] in the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' was later revised by government laws, which took land away from the M\u00e9tis.<ref name=\":8\" /> In order to receive scrip for children living or deceased, proof of birth in Manitoba prior to 1871 was required. Proof could be in the form of a baptismal or death certificate from the church, or a letter from an employer such as the Hudson's Bay Company.<ref name=\":8\" /> The legislature also enacted English-only laws, which were later found unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the case ''[[Reference re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' (1985). The ''Manitoba Act, 1870'', and Section 31 in particular, was also used in the 2013 Supreme Court case ''Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation v. Canada and Manitoba''.<ref name=\":6\">[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-13.html#anchorsc:7-bo-ga:l_VII ''Constitution Act, 1982'', s. 52] and [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-14.html#anchorsc:8 Schedule, Item 2].</ref>\n\n=== The Manitoba School Crisis ===\nMost clauses in the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' were agreed upon apart from one. Topics such as language and religion were safeguarded by the government and recognized by the Canadian court system. The clause on the right to [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] in educational systems was not safeguarded and was instead disputed amongst political figures. Notable people such as: Honourable Mr. [[Chauveau]] and Liberal leader Mr. Mackenzie had opposing views on the clause that would affect the right to education in French or English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Section 31 ===\nSection 31 required the government to provide a tract of land to each M\u00e9tis child upon reaching the age of 21 years, from a notional pool of 1.4 million acres of land appropriated for this purpose. M\u00e9tis families were promised a large amount of land through the ''Manitoba Act, 1870''. The government, however, did not grant the land until the land had been surveyed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The confrontations at Riviere aux Ilets-de-Bois. Manitoba History|last=McCullough|first=A.B|publisher=Winnipeg : G. Bourdeau|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=67}}</ref> The ''Act'', therefore, would ensure this process. However, the [[Canadian government]] later realized that the amount of land that was promised fell short compared to the number of M\u00e9tis children entitled. This issue is what changed the process of receiving land by lottery draw through the Land Titles Office to money scrips. The government decided to allot money scrips in place of land, which could only be provided for the purchase of lands in government-owned parts of the [[Northwest Territories]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Toole|first=D.|date=2014|title=Section 31 of the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'': A Land Claim Agreement|url=|journal=Manitoba Law Journal|volume=38|issue=1|pages=73\u2013117|postscript=.|via=}}</ref> In subsequent legal case regarding Section 31, the Court claimed that \u201cthere was no request for, expectation of or consideration by Canada to create a M\u00e9tis homeland or land base.\u201d<ref>[http://canlii.ca/t/2bgpf ''Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation'' v.

The execution of Thomas Scott had a great impact on how the Canadian government and its supporters viewed the M\u00e9tis. People were so outraged that when Riel was to make appearances at Parliament he did not attend in fear of getting himself killed.<ref name=\":53\">{{Cite journal|last=Richtik|first=James M.|date=1975|title=The Policy Framework for Settling the Canadian West 1870-1880|jstor=3741487|journal=Agricultural History|volume=49|issue=4|pages=613\u2013628}}</ref> Despite the execution, the Canadian government was still working towards sovereignty. \n\nThe ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' made the Red River Colony a part of Canada and created the province of Manitoba. Even with the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' in place, much work was to be done with the settling of land rights. Before land rights were settled [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. MacDonald]] convinced the British to send a military expedition to Manitoba, led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley. This Red River Expedition became known as the [[Wolseley expedition]]. The government portrayed this expedition as non-punitive; however, the militiamen wanted to avenge the death of Thomas Scott. The ensuing chaos and retribution against the M\u00e9tis population was labelled \"The Reign of Terror\" by newspapers in eastern Canada and the U.S.A.<ref>http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/149078.THE%20REIGN%20OF%20TERROR%20revised.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/red-river-expedition</ref> Many M\u00e9tis fled to Saskatchewan, while Louis Riel fled to the United States at this time.<ref name=\":53\" />\n\n=== The Government ===\nA district called [[Assiniboia (provincial electoral district)]] became a part of the Canadian Federation for the purpose of receiving 1.4 million acres of land that was specifically for the betterment of the M\u00e9tis nation. <ref>{{Citation|chapter=6.

They had many rights and requests that they pushed to be fulfilled by the Government of Canada. The following is a list of some of the Red River M\u00e9tis' demands for the ''Act''.<ref>Lawrence Barkwell, \u201cMetis Lists of Rights: The Evolution of the List from the First to Fourth Iteration\u201d (Louis Riel Institute).</ref><blockquote>'''Fourth list of rights'''\n\n'''May 9, 1870'''\n\n# That this province be governed:\n## By a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General of Canada;\n## By a Senate;\n## By a Legislature chosen by the people with a responsible ministry.\n# That, until such time as the increase of the population in this country entitle us to a greater number, we have two representatives in the Senate and four in the Commons of Canada.\n# That in entering the Confederation the Province of the Northwest be completely free from the public debt of Canada; and if called upon to assume a part of the said debt of Canada, that it be only after having received from Canada the same amount for which the said Province of the Northwest should be held responsible.\n# That the annual sum of $80,000 be allotted by the Dominion of Canada to the Legislature of the Province of the Northwest.\n# That all properties, rights and privileges enjoyed by us up to this day be respected, and that the recognition and settlement of customs, usages and privileges be left exclusively to the decision of the Local Legislature.\n# That this country be submitted to no direct taxation except such as may be imposed by the local legislature for municipal or other local purposes.\n# That the schools be separate, and that the public money for schools be distributed among the different religious denominations in proportion to their respective populations according to the system of the Province of Quebec.\n# That the determination of the qualifications of members for the parliament of the province or for the parliament of Canada be left to the local legislature.\n# That in this province, with the exception of the Indians, who are neither civilized nor settled, every man having attained the age of 21 years, and every foreigner being a British subject, after having resided three years in this country, and being Possessed of a house, be entitled to vote at the elections for the members of the local legislature and of the Canadian Parliament, and that every foreigner other than a British subject, having resided here during the same period, and being proprietor of a house, be likewise entitled to vote on condition of taking the oath of allegiance.

The ''Act'' also set aside land for the M\u00e9tis, with each family receiving scrip, a certificate, saying they owned 96 hectares of land, amount to a total of about 5{{Spaces|1|thin}}600 km<sup>2</sup>. The number of applications that the government was going to receive was greatly underestimated. The 1.4 million acres of land was not enough for the number of applications. The Canadian government began giving money for land, the equivalent value of $1 per acre, which was the current land value at that time.\n\nSection 31 reads in part:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/metis-scrip/005005-3100-e.html|title=Manitoba Commissions: Claims Under Section 31|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{block quote|And whereas, it is expedient, towards the extinguishment of the Indian Title to the lands in the Province, to appropriate a portion of such ungranted lands, to the extent of one million four hundred thousand acres thereof, for the benefit of the families of the half-breed residents, it is hereby enacted, that, under regulations to be from time to time made by the Governor General in Council, the Lieutenant-Governor shall select such lots or tracts in such parts of the Province as he may deem expedient, to the extent aforesaid, and divide the same among the children of the half-breed heads of families residing in the Province at the time of the said transfer to Canada, and the same shall be granted to the said children respectively, in such mode and on such conditions as to settlement and otherwise. as the Governor General in Council may from time to time determine.|sign=|source=}}\n\n=== Religious and language rights ===\nThe ''Act'' covered an array of topics. It contained religious and language rights.<ref name=\":53\" /> It allowed the M\u00e9tis to have rights to have [[Separate schools|denominational schools]]. The ''Act'' stated that laws had to be written and enforced in both French and English, either English or French can be used in the Legislature of Manitoba and any courts established by either Canada or the Province must use both languages. These have led to political controversy such as the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] in the nineteenth century, as denominational school rights were curtailed. \n\n=== Parliament of Canada ===\nThe ''Act'' also provided for Manitoba to send four members to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and two members to the [[Senate of Canada]].\n\n== Controversies ==\nSince the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' was put into action it has been adjusted and under review multiple times. Historian D. N. Sprague notes that the land assigned to the [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] in the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' was later revised by government laws, which took land away from the M\u00e9tis.<ref name=\":8\" /> In order to receive scrip for children living or deceased, proof of birth in Manitoba prior to 1871 was required. Proof could be in the form of a baptismal or death certificate from the church, or a letter from an employer such as the Hudson's Bay Company.<ref name=\":8\" /> The legislature also enacted English-only laws, which were later found unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the case ''[[Reference re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' (1985). The ''Manitoba Act, 1870'', and Section 31 in particular, was also used in the 2013 Supreme Court case ''Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation v. Canada and Manitoba''.<ref name=\":6\">[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-13.html#anchorsc:7-bo-ga:l_VII ''Constitution Act, 1982'', s. 52] and [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-14.html#anchorsc:8 Schedule, Item 2].</ref>\n\n=== The Manitoba School Crisis ===\nMost clauses in the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'' were agreed upon apart from one. Topics such as language and religion were safeguarded by the government and recognized by the Canadian court system. The clause on the right to [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] in educational systems was not safeguarded and was instead disputed amongst political figures. Notable people such as: Honourable Mr. [[Chauveau]] and Liberal leader Mr. Mackenzie had opposing views on the clause that would affect the right to education in French or English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Section 31 ===\nSection 31 required the government to provide a tract of land to each M\u00e9tis child upon reaching the age of 21 years, from a notional pool of 1.4 million acres of land appropriated for this purpose. M\u00e9tis families were promised a large amount of land through the ''Manitoba Act, 1870''. The government, however, did not grant the land until the land had been surveyed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The confrontations at Riviere aux Ilets-de-Bois. Manitoba History|last=McCullough|first=A.B|publisher=Winnipeg : G. Bourdeau|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=67}}</ref> The ''Act'', therefore, would ensure this process. However, the [[Canadian government]] later realized that the amount of land that was promised fell short compared to the number of M\u00e9tis children entitled. This issue is what changed the process of receiving land by lottery draw through the Land Titles Office to money scrips. The government decided to allot money scrips in place of land, which could only be provided for the purchase of lands in government-owned parts of the [[Northwest Territories]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Toole|first=D.|date=2014|title=Section 31 of the ''Manitoba Act, 1870'': A Land Claim Agreement|url=|journal=Manitoba Law Journal|volume=38|issue=1|pages=73\u2013117|postscript=.|via=}}</ref> In subsequent legal case regarding Section 31, the Court claimed that \u201cthere was no request for, expectation of or consideration by Canada to create a M\u00e9tis homeland or land base.\u201d<ref>[http://canlii.ca/t/2bgpf ''Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation'' v.

[...] The problem is [...] that (as the definition indicates) snapshots have come to be known, at least in some circles, not as snapshots at all but as materialized views. But snapshots aren't views; views are virtual and snapshots aren't, and 'materialized view' is a contradiction in terms (at least as far as the model is concerned). Worse yet, the unqualified term ''view'' is often taken to mean a materialized view specifically, and thus we're in danger of no longer having a good term for a view in the original sense.}}</ref>\n\nIn any [[database management system]] following the [[relational model]], a [[view (database)|view]] is a virtual [[table (database)|table]] representing the result of a [[database]] [[Information retrieval|query]]. Whenever a query or an update addresses an ordinary view's virtual table, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying base tables. A materialized view takes a different approach: the query result is [[database cache|cached]] as a concrete (\"materialized\") table (rather than a view as such) that may be updated from the original base tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of extra storage and of some data being potentially out-of-date. Materialized views find use especially in [[data warehousing]] scenarios, where frequent queries of the actual base tables can be expensive. \n\nIn a materialized view, [[index (database)|indexes]] can be built on any column. In contrast, in a normal view, it's typically only possible to exploit indexes on columns that come directly from (or have a mapping to) indexed columns in the base tables; often this functionality is not offered at all.\n\n==Implementations==\n\n===Oracle===\nMaterialized views were implemented first by the [[Oracle Database]]: the Query rewrite feature was added from version 8i.<ref>[http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~melody/courses/Fall2001CSCI379/DOC/server.815/a67775/ch2.htm Oracle8i Tuning Release 8.1.5].

The main difference is that such views do not require a refresh because they are in fact always synchronized to the original data of the tables that compound the view. To achieve this, it is necessary that the lines of origin and destination are \"deterministic\" in their mapping which limits the types of possible queries to do this.

Whenever a query or an update addresses an ordinary view's virtual table, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying base tables. A materialized view takes a different approach: the query result is [[database cache|cached]] as a concrete (\"materialized\") table (rather than a view as such) that may be updated from the original base tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of extra storage and of some data being potentially out-of-date. Materialized views find use especially in [[data warehousing]] scenarios, where frequent queries of the actual base tables can be expensive. \n\nIn a materialized view, [[index (database)|indexes]] can be built on any column. In contrast, in a normal view, it's typically only possible to exploit indexes on columns that come directly from (or have a mapping to) indexed columns in the base tables; often this functionality is not offered at all.\n\n==Implementations==\n\n===Oracle===\nMaterialized views were implemented first by the [[Oracle Database]]: the Query rewrite feature was added from version 8i.<ref>[http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~melody/courses/Fall2001CSCI379/DOC/server.815/a67775/ch2.htm Oracle8i Tuning Release 8.1.5].

The main difference is that such views do not require a refresh because they are in fact always synchronized to the original data of the tables that compound the view.

Farming began earliest on the southern tips of the Sahara, eventually giving rise to village settlements. Toward the end of the classical era, larger regional kingdoms had formed in West Africa, one of which was the [[Kingdom of Ghana]], north of what is today the nation of Ghana.  Before its fall at the beginning of the 10th century [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] migrants moved southward and founded several nation-states, including the first empire of [[Bono state|Bono]] founded in the 11th century and for which the [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]] (Bono Ahafo) region is named.  Later Akan [[ethnic group]]s such as the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] empire-kingdom and [[Fante people|Fante]] states are thought to possibly have roots in the original Bono settlement at Bono Manso. Much of the area was united under the [[Empire of Ashanti]] by the 16th century. The Ashanti government operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralized empire-kingdom with an advanced, highly specialized bureaucracy centred on the capital [[Kumasi]].\n\n== Precolonial period ==\n[[File:Akan face.jpg|thumb|150px|A 16th\u201317th-century [[kwame kwame people|Akan]] Terracotta, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.]]\nBy the end of the 16th century, most of the ethnic groups constituting the modern Ghanaian population had settled in their present locations. Archaeological remains found in the coastal zone indicate that the area has been inhabited since the [[Bronze Age]] (ca. 2000 BC), but these societies, based on fishing in the extensive lagoons and rivers, have left few traces. Archaeological work also suggests that central Ghana north of the forest zone was inhabited as early as 3,000 to 4,000 years ago.<ref name=pc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Pre-Colonial. Peter is a ''national'' '''citizen''' of Ghana and is the dictator.</ref>\n\nThese migrations resulted in part from the formation and disintegration of a series of large states in the [[western Sudan]] (the region north of modern Ghana drained by the [[Niger River]]). Strictly speaking, ''ghana'' was the title of the king, but the [[Arabs]], who left records of the kingdom, applied the term to the king, the capital, and the state. The 9th-century [[Berber people|Berber]] historian and geographer [[Al Yaqubi]] described ancient Ghana as one of the three most organized states in the region (the others being [[Gao]] and [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] in the central Sudan).<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Nehemia Levtzion|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia|title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen & Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIts rulers were renowned for their wealth in gold, the opulence of their courts, and their warrior/hunting skills. They were also masters of the trade in gold, which drew North African merchants to the western Sudan. The military achievements of these and later western Sudanic rulers, and their control over the region's gold mines, constituted the nexus of their historical relations with merchants and rulers in North Africa and the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name=pc />\n\n[[File:Kumasi.png|thumb|300px|An image of an [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] home from the 18th century.]]\nGhana succumbed to attacks by its neighbors in the 11th century, but its name and reputation endured. In 1957, when the leaders of the former British colony of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] sought an appropriate name for their newly independent state\u2014the first black African nation to gain its independence from [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule\u2014they named their new country after ancient Ghana. The choice was more than merely symbolic, because modern Ghana, like its namesake, was equally famed for its wealth and trade in gold.<ref name=pc />\n\nAlthough none of the states of the western Sudan controlled territories in the area that is modern Ghana, several small kingdoms that later developed such as [[Bonoman]], were ruled by nobles believed to have immigrated from that region. The trans-[[Sahara]]n trade that contributed to the expansion of kingdoms in the western Sudan also led to the development of contacts with regions in northern modern Ghana, and in the forest to the south.<ref name=pc />\n\nThe growth of trade stimulated the development of early Akan states located on the trade route to the goldfields, in the forest zone of the south. The forest itself was thinly populated, but Akan-speaking peoples began to move into it toward the end of the 15th century, with the arrival of crops from South-east Asia and the New World that could be adapted to forest conditions. These new crops included [[sorghum]], bananas, and [[cassava]]. By the beginning of the 16th century, European sources noted the existence of the gold-rich states of Akan and [[Twifo Praso|Twifu]] in the [[Ofin River Valley]].<ref name=pc />\n\nAccording to oral traditions and archaeological evidence, the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] states were the earliest kingdoms to emerge in present-day Ghana as early as the 11th century, being well established by the close of the 16th century.<ref name=pc /> Although the rulers of the Dagomba states were not usually Muslim, they brought with them, or welcomed, Muslims as scribes and medicine men. As a result of their presence, [[Islam]] influenced the north and Muslim influence spread by the activities of merchants and clerics.<ref name=pc />\n\nIn the broad belt of rugged country between the northern boundaries of the Muslim-influenced state of Dagomba, and the southernmost outposts of the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] (of present-day northern Ghana and southern [[Burkina Faso]]), were peoples who were not incorporated into the Dagomba entity. Among these peoples were the [[Kassena]] agriculturalists. They lived in a so-called segmented society, bound together by kinship tie, and ruled by the head of their clan. Trade between Akan kingdoms and the Mossi kingdoms to the north flowed through their homeland, subjecting them to Islamic influence, and to the depredations of these more powerful control.\n\n== Ashanti Empire ==\n{{Main|Ashanti Empire}}\n\n[[File:Asante map.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of the [[Ashanti Empire]].]]\nUnder Chief <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[Oti Akenten]], Please create a article if you can.

At the end of the 17th century, [[Osei Tutu]] (died 1712 or 1717) became Asantehene (king of Ashanti). Under Osei Tutu's rule, the confederacy of Ashanti states was transformed into an [[Ashanti Empire|empire]] with its capital at Kumasi. Political and military consolidation ensued, resulting in firmly established centralized authority.<ref>Robin Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'' (University of Michigan Press: Ann Arbor, 1970) p. 69.</ref>\n\nOsei Tutu was strongly influenced by the high priest, [[Anokye]], who, tradition asserts, caused a stool of gold to descend from the sky to seal the union of Ashanti states. Stools already functioned as traditional symbols of chieftainship, but the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] represented the united spirit of all the allied states and established a dual allegiance that superimposed the confederacy over the individual component states. The Golden Stool remains a respected national symbol of the traditional past and figures extensively in Ashanti ritual.<ref name=pc />\n\nOsei Tutu permitted newly conquered territories that joined the confederation to retain their own customs and chiefs, who were given seats on the Ashanti state council. Tutu's gesture made the process relatively easy and nondisruptive, because most of the earlier conquests had subjugated other Akan peoples. Within the Ashanti portions of the confederacy, each minor state continued to exercise internal self-rule, and its chief jealously guarded the state's prerogatives against encroachment by the central authority. A strong unity developed, however, as the various communities subordinated their individual interests to central authority in matters of national concern.<ref name=pc />\n\nBy the mid-18th century, Ashanti was a highly organized state. The wars of expansion that brought the northern states of Dagomba,<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 153.</ref> Mamprusi, and Gonja<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', pp. 153-154.</ref> under Ashanti influence were won during the reign of [[Opoku Ware I]] (died 1750), successor to [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]]. By the 1820s, successive rulers had extended Ashanti boundaries southward. Although the northern expansions linked Ashanti with trade networks across the desert and in [[Hausaland]] to the east, movements into the south brought the Ashanti into contact, sometimes antagonistic, with the coastal [[Fante people|Fante]], as well as with the various European merchants whose fortresses dotted the Gold Coast.<ref name=pc />\n\n== Early European contact and the slave trade ==\n{{See also|Portuguese Gold Coast}}\nWhen the first Europeans arrived in the late 15th century, many inhabitants of the Gold Coast area were striving to consolidate their newly acquired territories and to settle into a secure and permanent environment. Initially, the Gold Coast did not participate in the export slave trade, rather as [[Ivor Wilks]], a leading colonial historian of Ghana, noted, the Akan purchased slaves from Portuguese traders operating from other parts of Africa, including the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] and [[Benin]] in order to augment the labour needed for the state formation that was characteristic of this period.<ref name=eec>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Early European Contact and the Slave Trade\".</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive. By 1471, they had reached the area that was to become known as the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Hallett 164\">Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 164.</ref> The Gold Coast was so-named because it was an important source of gold. The Portuguese interest in trading for gold, ivory, and pepper so increased that in 1482 the Portuguese built their first permanent trading post on the western coast of present-day Ghana. This fortress, a trade castle called [[S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] (later called [[Elmina Castle]]), was constructed to protect Portuguese trade from European competitors, and after frequent rebuildings and modifications, still stands.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe Portuguese position on the Gold Coast remained secure for over a century. During that time, [[Lisbon]] sought to monopolize all trade in the region in royal hands, though appointed officials at S\u00e3o Jorge, and used force to prevent English, French, and Flemish efforts to trade on the coast. By 1598, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] began trading on the Gold Coast.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 219.</ref> The Dutch built forts at Komenda and Kormantsi by 1612. In 1637 they captured Elmina Castle from the Portuguese and Axim in 1642 (Fort St Anthony). Other European traders joined in by the mid-17th century, largely English, [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danes]], and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Swedes]]. The coastline was dotted by more than 30 forts and castles built by Dutch, British, and Danish merchants primarily to protect their interests from other Europeans and pirates. The Gold Coast became the highest concentration of European military architecture outside of Europe. Sometimes they were also drawn into conflicts with local inhabitants as Europeans developed commercial alliances with local political authorities. These alliances, often complicated, involved both Europeans attempting to enlist or persuade their closest allies to attack rival European ports and their African allies, or conversely, various African powers seeking to recruit Europeans as mercenaries in their inter-state wars, or as diplomats to resolve conflicts.<ref name=eec />\n\n[[File:Guinea map 1725.jpg|thumb|350px|A map of the [[Swedish Gold Coast]].]]\nForts were built, abandoned, attacked, captured, sold, and exchanged, and many sites were selected at one time or another for fortified positions by contending European nations.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe [[Dutch West India Company]] operated throughout most of the 18th century.

These enterprises built and manned new installations as the companies pursued their trading activities and defended their respective jurisdictions with varying degrees of government backing. There were short-lived ventures by the Swedes and the [[Prussia]]ns. The Danes remained until 1850, when they withdrew from the Gold Coast. The British gained possession of all Dutch coastal forts by the last quarter of the 19th century, thus making them the dominant European power on the Gold Coast.<ref name=eec />\n\nIn the late 17th century, social changes within the polities of the Gold Coast led to transformations in warfare, and to the shift from being a gold exporting and slave importing economy to being a major local slave exporting economy.<ref>[[Walter Rodney]], \"From Gold to Slaves on the Gold Coast\", in ''Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Triangular trade.svg|thumb|The triangular Atlantic slave trade routes.]]\nSome scholars have challenged the premise that rulers on the Gold Coast engaged in wars of expansion for the sole purpose of acquiring slaves for the export market. For example, the Ashanti waged war mainly to pacify territories that in were under Ashanti control, to exact tribute payments from subordinate kingdoms, and to secure access to trade routes\u2014particularly those that connected the interior with the coast.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe supply of slaves to the Gold Coast was entirely in African hands. Most rulers, such as the kings of various Akan states engaged in the slave trade, as well as individual local merchants.<ref name=eec /> A good number of the Slaves were also brought from various countries in the region and sold to middle men.\n\nThe demographic impact of the slave trade on West Africa was probably substantially greater than the number actually enslaved because a significant number of Africans perished during wars and bandit attacks or while in captivity awaiting transshipment. All nations with an interest in West Africa participated in the slave trade. Relations between the Europeans and the local populations were often strained, and distrust led to frequent clashes. Disease caused high losses among the Europeans engaged in the slave trade, but the profits realized from the trade continued to attract them.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe growth of [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] sentiment among Europeans made slow progress against vested African and European interests that were reaping profits from the traffic. Although individual clergymen condemned the slave trade as early as the 17th century, major Christian denominations did little to further early efforts at abolition. The [[Quakers]], however, publicly declared themselves against slavery as early as 1727.

According to historian [[Eric Williams]], for example, Europe abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade only because its profitability was undermined by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Williams argued that mass unemployment caused by the new industrial machinery, the need for new raw materials, and European competition for markets for finished goods are the real factors that brought an end to the trade in human cargo and the beginning of competition for colonial territories in Africa. Other scholars, however, disagree with Williams, arguing that humanitarian concerns as well as social and economic factors were instrumental in ending the African slave trade.<ref name=eec />\n\n== British Gold Coast ==\n{{Main|Gold Coast (British colony)}}\n\n=== Britain and the Gold Coast: the early years ===\n[[File:FortsSekondi.JPG|thumb|300px|Neighbouring British and Dutch forts at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Sekondi]].]]\nBy the later part of the 19th century the Dutch and the British were the only traders left and after the Dutch withdrew in 1874, Britain made the Gold Coast a protectorate\u2014a British Crown Colony. During the previous few centuries parts of the area were controlled by British, Portuguese, and Scandinavian powers, with the British ultimately prevailing. These nation-states maintained varying alliances with the colonial powers and each other, which resulted in the 1806 [[Ashanti-Fante War]], as well as an ongoing struggle by the [[Empire of Ashanti]] against the British, the four [[Anglo-Ashanti Wars]].\n\nBy the early 19th century the British acquired most of the forts along the coast. About one tenth of the total slave trades that occurred happened on the Gold Coast.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Joerg |last2=Austin |first2=Gareth |last3=Moradi |first3=Alexander |title=Exploring the evolution of living standards in Ghana, 1880-2000: An anthropometric approach |date=January 2007 |pages=3}}</ref> Two major factors laid the foundations of British rule and the eventual establishment of a colony on the Gold Coast: British reaction to the Ashanti wars and the resulting instability and disruption of trade, and Britain's increasing preoccupation with the suppression and elimination of the slave trade.<ref name=bgc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Britain and the Gold Coast: the Early Years\".</ref>\n\nDuring most of the 19th century, Ashanti, the most powerful state of the Akan interior, sought to expand its rule and to promote and protect its trade. The first Ashanti invasion of the coastal regions took place in 1807; the Ashanti moved south again in 1811 and in 1814. These invasions, though not decisive, disrupted trade in such products as gold, timber, and palm oil, and threatened the security of the European forts. Local British, Dutch, and Danish authorities were all forced to come to terms with Ashanti, and in 1817 the African Company of Merchants signed a treaty of friendship that recognized Ashanti claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast and its peoples.<ref name=bgc />\n\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|300px|A battle during the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]].]]\nThe coastal people, primarily some of the Fante and the inhabitants of the new town of [[Accra]] came to rely on British protection against Ashanti incursions, but the ability of the merchant companies to provide this security was limited. The British Crown dissolved the company in 1821, giving authority over British forts on the Gold Coast to Governor [[Charles MacCarthy (British Army officer)|Charles MacCarthy]], governor of [[Sierra Leone]]. The British forts and Sierra Leone remained under common administration for the first half of the century. MacCarthy's mandate was to impose peace and to end the slave trade. He sought to do this by encouraging the coastal peoples to oppose Kumasi rule and by closing the great roads to the coast. Incidents and sporadic warfare continued, however. In 1823, the First [[Anglo-Ashanti War]] broke out and lasted until 1831.<ref name=\"Hallett p. 188\" /> MacCarthy was killed, and most of his force was wiped out in a battle with Ashanti forces in 1824.<ref name=bgc />\n\nWhen the English government allowed control of the Gold Coast settlements to revert to the British African Company of Merchants in the late 1820s, relations with the Ashanti were still problematic. From the Ashanti point of view, the British had failed to control the activities of their local coastal allies. Had this been done, Ashanti might not have found it necessary to attempt to impose peace on the coastal peoples. MacCarthy's encouragement of coastal opposition to Ashanti and the subsequent 1824 British military attack further indicated to the Ashanti authorities that the Europeans, especially the British, did not respect Ashanti.<ref name=bgc />\n\nIn 1830 a London committee of merchants chose Captain George Maclean to become president of a local council of merchants. Although his formal jurisdiction was limited, Maclean's achievements were substantial. For example, a peace treaty was arranged with the Ashanti in 1831. Maclean also supervised the coastal people by holding regular court in Cape Coast where he punished those found guilty of disturbing the peace. Between 1830 and 1843 while Maclean was in charge of affairs on the Gold Coast, no confrontations occurred with Ashanti, and the volume of trade reportedly increased threefold.<ref name=bgc />\n\nMaclean's exercise of limited judicial power on the coast was so effective that a parliamentary committee recommended that the British government permanently administer its settlements and negotiate treaties with the coastal chiefs that would define Britain's relations with them. The government did so in 1843, the same year crown government was reinstated. Commander H. Worsley Hill was appointed first governor of the Gold Coast. Under Maclean's administration, several coastal tribes had submitted voluntarily to British protection. Hill proceeded to define the conditions and responsibilities of his jurisdiction over the protected areas. He negotiated a special treaty with a number of Fante and other local chiefs that became known as the Bond of 1844. This document obliged local leaders to submit serious crimes, such as murder and robbery, to British jurisdiction and laid the legal foundation for subsequent British colonization of the coastal area.<ref name=bgc />\n\n[[File:Viscount Garnet Joseph Wolseley.jpeg|180px|thumb|Major General Sir Garnet Wolseley.]]\nAdditional coastal states as well as other states farther inland eventually signed the Bond, and British influence was accepted, strengthened, and expanded. Under the terms of the 1844 arrangement, the British gave the impression that they would protect the coastal areas; thus, an informal protectorate came into being. As responsibilities for defending local allies and managing the affairs of the coastal protectorate increased, the administration of the Gold Coast was separated from that of Sierra Leone in 1850.<ref name=bgc />\n\nAt about the same time, growing acceptance of the advantages offered by the British presence led to the initiation of another important step. In April 1852, local chiefs and elders met at Cape Coast to consult with the governor on means of raising revenue. With the governor's approval, the council of chiefs constituted itself as a legislative assembly. In approving its resolutions, the governor indicated that the assembly of chiefs should become a permanent fixture of the protectorate's constitutional machinery, but the assembly was given no specific constitutional authority to pass laws or to levy taxes without the consent of the people.<ref name=bgc />\n\nThe Second Anglo-Ashanti War broke out in 1863 and lasted until 1864. In 1872, British influence over the Gold Coast increased further when Britain purchased [[Elmina Castle]], the last of the Dutch forts along the coast.<ref>Robin Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1974), p. 279.</ref> The Ashanti, who for years had considered the Dutch at [[Elmina]] as their allies, thereby lost their last trade outlet to the sea. To prevent this loss and to ensure that revenue received from that post continued, the Ashanti staged their last invasion of the coast in 1873. After early successes, they finally came up against well-trained British forces who compelled them to retreat beyond the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra River]]. Later attempts to negotiate a settlement of the conflict with the British were rejected by the commander of their forces, Major General Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]]. To settle the Ashanti problem permanently, the British invaded Ashanti with a sizable military force. This invasion initiated the Third [[Anglo-Ashanti War]]. The attack, which was launched in January 1874 by 2,500 British soldiers and large numbers of African auxiliaries, resulted in the occupation and burning of Kumasi, the Ashanti capital.<ref name=bgc />\n\nThe subsequent peace treaty of 1875, required the Ashanti to renounce any claim to many southern territories. The Ashanti also had to keep the road to Kumasi open to trade. From this point on, Ashanti power steadily declined. The confederation slowly disintegrated as subject territories broke away and as protected regions defected to British rule. The warrior spirit of the nation was not entirely subdued, however, and enforcement of the treaty led to recurring difficulties and outbreaks of fighting. In 1896, the British dispatched another expedition that again occupied Kumasi and that forced Ashanti to become a protectorate of the British Crown. This became the Fourth [[Anglo-Ashanti War]] which lasted from 1894 until 1896. The position of \"Asantehene\" was abolished and the incumbent, [[Prempeh I]], was exiled.<ref name=bgc /> A British resident was installed at [[Kumasi]].<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" />\n\nThe core of the Ashanti federation accepted these terms grudgingly. In 1900 the Ashanti rebelled again (the [[War of the Golden Stool]]) but were defeated the next year, and in 1902 the British proclaimed Ashanti a colony under the jurisdiction of the governor of the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" /> The annexation was made with misgivings and recriminations on both sides. With Ashanti, and golden district subdued and annexed, British colonization of the region became a reality.<ref name=bgc />\n\n===Protestant missions===\nThe Protestant nations in Western Europe, including Britain, had a vigorous evangelical element in the 19th century that felt their nations had a duty to \"civilize\" what they saw as slaves, sinners, and savages. Along with business opportunities, and the quest for national glory, the evangelical mission to save souls for Christ was a powerful impulse to imperialism. Practically all of Western Africa consisted of slave societies, in which warfare to capture new slaves\u2014and perhaps sell them to itinerant slave traders\u2014was a well-established economic, social, and political situation. The missionaries first of all targeted the slave trade, but they insisted that both the slave trade in the practice of traditional slavery were morally abhorrent.  They worked hard and organized to abolish the trade. The transoceanic slave ships were targeted by the Royal Navy, and the trade faded away. Overland slave trading, practiced especially by Muslim traders from northeastern Africa, continued apace until the early 20th century. The abolition of slavery did not end the forced labor of children, however.  The first missionaries to pre-colonial Ghana, were a multiracial mixture of European, African, and Caribbean pietists employed by Switzerland's [[Basel Mission]]. The policies were adopted by later missionary organizations.<ref>Paul Grant,  \u201cStrangers And Neighbors In Precolonial Ghana\u201d \u2018\u2019Fides et Historia.\u2019\u2019 (2018) '''50''' (2): 94\u2013107.</ref>\n \nThe Basel Mission had tight budgets and depended on child labor for many routine operations.  The children were students in the mission schools who split their time between general education, religious studies, and unpaid labor. The Basel Mission made it a priority to alleviate the harsh conditions of child labor imposed by slavery, and the debt bondage of their parents.<ref>Catherine  Koonar, \"Using child labor to save souls: the Basel Mission in colonial Ghana, 1855\u20131900.\" \u2018\u2019Atlantic Studies\u2019\u2019 11.4 (2014): 536-554.</ref>\n\n=== British rule of the Gold Coast: the colonial era ===\n{{Main|West Africa Campaign (World War I)|West  Africa Campaign (World War II)}}\n\n[[File:Gold Coast Map 1896.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1896 map of the British Gold Coast Colony.]]\nMilitary confrontations between Ashanti and the Fante contributed to the growth of British influence on the Gold Coast, as the Fante states\u2014concerned about Ashanti activities on the coast\u2014signed the <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[Bond of 1844]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->Bond of 1844 at Fomena-Adansi, that allowed the British to usurp judicial authority from African courts. As a result of the exercise of ever-expanding judicial powers on the coast and also to ensure that the coastal peoples remained firmly under control, the British proclaimed the existence of the Gold Coast Colony on July 24, 1874, which extended from the coast inland to the edge of Ashanti territory. Though the coastal peoples were unenthusiastic about this development, there was no popular resistance, likely because the British made no claim to any rights to the land.<ref name=ce>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Colonial Era: British Rule of the Gold Coast\".</ref>\n\nIn 1896, a British military force invaded Ashanti and overthrew the native ''Asantehene'' named [[Prempeh I]].<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 281.</ref> The deposed Ashanti leader was replaced by a British resident at Kumasi.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" /> The British sphere of influence was, thus, extended to include Ashanti following their defeat in 1896. However, British Governor Hodgson went too far in his restrictions on the Ashanti, when, in 1900, he demanded the \"Golden Stool,\" the symbol of Ashanti rule and independence for the Ashanti. This caused another Ashanti revolt against the British colonizers.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" /> The Ashanti were defeated again in 1901. Once the Asantehene and his council had been exiled, the British appointed a resident commissioner to Ashanti. Each Ashanti state was administered as a separate entity and was ultimately responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast.\n\nIn the meantime, the British became interested in the Northern Territories north of Ashanti, which they believed would forestall the advances of the French and the Germans. After 1896 protection was extended to northern areas whose trade with the coast had been controlled by Ashanti. In 1898 and 1899, European colonial powers amicably demarcated the boundaries between the Northern Territories and the surrounding French and German colonies. The Northern Territories were proclaimed a British protectorate in 1902. Like the Ashanti protectorate, the Northern Territories were placed under the authority of a resident commissioner who was responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast. The governor ruled both Ashanti and the Northern Territories by proclamations until 1946.<ref name=ce />\n\nWith the north under British control, the three territories of the Gold Coast\u2014the Colony (the coastal regions), Ashanti, and the Northern Territories\u2014became, for all practical purposes, a single political unit, or crown colony, known as the Gold Coast. The borders of present-day Ghana were realized in May 1956 when the people of the Volta region, known as British Mandated Togoland, a vote was made in a plebiscite on whether [[British Togoland]] should become part of modern Ghana; the [[Togoland Congress]] voted 42% against. 58% of votes opted for integration.<ref name=ce />\n\n==== Colonial administration ====\nBeginning in 1850, the coastal regions increasingly came under control of the governor of the British fortresses, who was assisted by the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. The Executive Council was a small advisory body of European officials that recommended laws and voted taxes, subject to the governor's approval. The Legislative Council included the members of the Executive Council and unofficial members initially chosen from British commercial interests. After 1900 three chiefs and three other Africans were added to the Legislative Council, though the inclusion of Africans from Ashanti and the Northern Territories did not take place until much later.<ref name=ca>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Colonial Administration\".</ref>\n\nThe gradual emergence of centralized colonial government brought about unified control over local services, although the actual administration of these services was still delegated to local authorities. Specific duties and responsibilities came to be clearly delineated, and the role of traditional states in local administration was also clarified. The structure of local government had its roots in traditional patterns of government. Village councils of chiefs and elders were responsible for the immediate needs of individual localities, including traditional law and order and the general welfare. The councils ruled by consent rather than by right: though chosen by the ruling class, a chief continued to rule because he was accepted by his people.<ref name=ca />\n\n[[File:Elmina slave castle.jpg|thumb|300px|The Portuguese-built [[Elmina Castle]] as purchased by Britain in 1873. It is now a World Heritage Site.]]\nBritish authorities adopted a system of indirect rule for colonial administration, wherein traditional chiefs maintained power but took instructions from their European supervisors. Indirect rule was cost-effective (by reducing the number of European officials needed), minimized local opposition to European rule, and guaranteed law and order. Though theoretically decentralizing, indirect rule in practice caused chiefs to look to Accra (the capital) rather than to their people for decisions. Many chiefs, who were rewarded with honors, decorations, and knighthood by government commissioners, came to regard themselves as a ruling aristocracy. In its preservation of traditional forms of power, indirect rule failed to provide opportunities for the country's growing population of educated young men. Other groups were dissatisfied because there was insufficient cooperation between the councils and the central government and because some felt that the local authorities were too dominated by the British district commissioners.<ref name=ca />\n\nIn 1925 provincial councils of chiefs were established in all three territories of the colony, partly to give the chiefs a colony-wide function. The 1927 Native Administration Ordinance clarified and regulated the powers and areas of jurisdiction of chiefs and councils. In 1935 the Native Authorities Ordinance combined the central colonial government and the local authorities into a single governing system. New native authorities, appointed by the governor, were given wide powers of local government under the supervision of the central government's provincial commissioners, who made sure that their policies would be those of the central government. The provincial councils and moves to strengthen them were not popular. Even by British standards, the chiefs were not given enough power to be effective instruments of indirect rule. Some Ghanaians believed that the reforms, by increasing the power of the chiefs at the expense of local initiative, permitted the colonial government to avoid movement toward any form of popular participation in the colony's government.<ref name=ca />\n\n==== Economic and social development ====\nThe years of British administration of the Gold Coast during the 20th century were an era of significant progress in social, economic, and educational development. Communications and railroads were greatly improved. New crops were introduced. A leading crop that was the result of an introduced crop was coffee.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 327\" /> However, most spectacular among these introduced crops was the cacao tree which had been indigenous to the New World and had been introduced in Africa by the Spanish and Portuguese.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 327\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 327.</ref>  Cacao had been introduced to the Gold Coast in 1879 by [[Tetteh Quashie]], a blacksmith from Gold Coast.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', pp. 327-328.</ref> Cacao tree raising and farming became widely accepted in the eastern part of the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 327\" />\n\nIn 1891, the Gold Coast exported 80&nbsp;lbs of cacao worth no more than 4 pounds sterling. By the 1920s cacao exports had passed 200,000 tons and had reached a value of 4.7 million pounds sterling. By 1928, cacao exports had reached 11.7 million pounds sterling.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 328.</ref> From 1890 to 1911, cocoa exports went from zero to one of the largest in the world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Joerg |last2=Austin |first2=Gareth |last3=Moradi |first3=Alexander |title=Exploring the evolution of living standards in Ghana, 1880-2000: An anthropometric approach |date=January 2007 |pages=3}}</ref> Thus, cacao production became a major part of the economy of the Gold coast and later a major part of Ghana's economy.<ref name=esd>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Economic and Social Development\".</ref>\n\nThe colony's earnings increased further from the export of timber and gold. Revenue from export of the colony's natural resources financed internal improvements in infrastructure and social services. The foundation of an educational system more advanced than any other else in West Africa also resulted from mineral export revenue. It was through British-style education that a new Ghanaian elite gained the means and the desire to strive for independence. From beginnings in missionary schools, the early part of the 20th century saw the opening of secondary schools and the country's first institute of higher learning.<ref name=esd />\n\nMany of the economic and social improvements in the Gold Coast in the early part of the 20th century have been attributed to the Canadian-born [[Gordon Guggisberg]], governor from 1919 to 1927.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 303\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: a Modern History'', p. 303.</ref> Within the first six weeks of his governorship, he presented a ten-year development programme to the Legislative Council.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 303\" /> He suggested first the improvement of [[Transport in Ghana|transportation]]. Then, in order of priority, his prescribed improvements included water supply, drainage, hydroelectric projects, public buildings, town improvements, schools, hospitals, prisons, communication lines, and other services. Guggisberg also set a goal of filling half of the colony's technical positions with Africans as soon as they could be trained. His programme has been described as the most ambitious ever proposed in West Africa up to that time.<ref name=esd />\n\nThe colony assisted Britain in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the ensuing years, however, postwar inflation and instability severely hampered readjustment for returning veterans, who were in the forefront of growing discontent and unrest. Their war service and veterans' associations had broadened their horizons, making it difficult for them to return to the humble and circumscribed positions set aside for Africans by the colonial authorities.<ref name=esd />\n\n=== The growth of nationalism and the end of colonial rule ===\nAs Ghana developed economically, education of the citizenry progressed apace.  In 1890 there were only 5 government and 49 \"assisted\" mission schools in the whole of the Gold Coast with a total enrollment of only 5,000.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" /> By 1920 there were 20 governmental schools, 188 \"assisted\" mission and 309 \"unassisted\" mission schools with a total enrollment of 43,000 pupils.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" /> By 1940, there were 91,000 children attending Gold Coast schools. By 1950, the 279,000 children attending some 3,000 schools in the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 341.</ref> This meant that, in 1950, 43.6% of the school-age children in the Gold Coast colony were attending school.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" />\n\nThus by the end of the Second World War, the Gold Coast colony was the richest and most educated territories in West Africa.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" /> Within this educated environment, the focus of government power gradually shifted from the hands of the governor and his officials into those of Ghanaians, themselves. The changes resulted from the gradual development of a strong spirit of nationalism and were to result eventually in independence. The development of national consciousness accelerated quickly in the post-World War II era, when, in addition to ex-servicemen, a substantial group of urban African workers and traders emerged to lend mass support to the aspirations of a small educated minority.\n\n==== Early manifestations of nationalism in Ghana ====\nBy the late 19th century, a growing number of educated Africans increasingly found unacceptable an arbitrary political system that placed almost all power in the hands of the governor through his appointment of council members. In the 1890s, some members of the educated coastal elite organized themselves into the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society to protest a land bill that threatened traditional land tenure. This protest helped lay the foundation for political action that would ultimately lead to independence. In 1920, one of the African members of the Legislative Council, [[J. E. Casely Hayford|Joseph E. Casely-Hayford]], convened the National Congress of British West Africa.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 353\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 353.</ref>  The National Congress demanded a wide range of reforms and innovations for British West Africa.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 353\" />\n\nThe National Congress sent a delegation to London to urge the Colonial Office to consider the principle of elected representation. The group, which claimed to speak for all British West African colonies, represented the first expression of political solidarity between intellectuals and nationalists of the area. Though the delegation was not received in London (on the grounds that it represented only the interests of a small group of urbanized Africans), its actions aroused considerable support among the African elite at home.<ref name=emn>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Early Manifestations of Nationalism\".</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding their call for elected representation as opposed to a system whereby the governor appointed council members, these nationalists insisted that they were loyal to the British Crown and that they merely sought an extension of British political and social practices to Africans. Notable leaders included [[Africanus Horton]], the writer [[John Mensah Sarbah]], and <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[S. R. B. Attah-Ahoma]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->S. R. B. Attah-Ahoma. Such men gave the nationalist movement a distinctly elitist flavour that was to last until the late 1940s.<ref name=emn />\n\nThe constitution of April 8, 1925, promulgated by Guggisberg, created provincial councils of paramount chiefs for all but the northern provinces of the colony. These councils in turn elected six chiefs as unofficial members of the Legislative Council, which however had an inbuilt British majority and whose powers were in any case purely advisory. Although the new constitution appeared to recognize some African sentiments, Guggisberg was concerned primarily with protecting British interests. For example, he provided Africans with a limited voice in the central government; yet, by limiting nominations to chiefs, he drove a wedge between chiefs and their educated subjects. The intellectuals believed that the chiefs, in return for British support, had allowed the provincial councils to fall completely under control of the government. By the mid-1930s, however, a gradual rapprochement between chiefs and intellectuals had begun.<ref name=emn />\n\nAgitation for more adequate representation continued. Newspapers owned and managed by Africans played a major part in provoking this discontent\u2014six were being published in the 1930s. As a result of the call for broader representation, two more unofficial African members were added to the Executive Council in 1943. Changes in the Legislative Council, however, had to await a different political climate in London, which came about only with the postwar election of a British Labour Party government.<ref name=emn />\n\nThe new Gold Coast constitution of March 29, 1946 (also known as the Burns constitution after the governor of the time, Sir [[Alan Cuthbert Maxwell Burns]]) was a bold document. For the first time, the concept of an official majority was abandoned. The Legislative Council was now composed of six ex-officio members, six nominated members, and eighteen elected members, however the Legislative Council continued to have purely advisory powers \u2013 all executive power remained with the governor. The 1946 constitution also admitted representatives from Ashanti into the council for the first time. Even with a Labour Party government in power, however, the British continued to view the colonies as a source of raw materials that were needed to strengthen their crippled economy. Change that would place real power in African hands was not a priority among British leaders until after [[1948 Accra Riots|rioting and looting in Accra]] and other towns and cities in early 1948 over issues of pensions for ex-servicemen, the dominant role of foreigners in the economy, the shortage of housing, and other economic and political grievances.<ref name=emn />\n\nWith elected members in a decisive majority, Ghana had reached a level of political maturity unequalled anywhere in colonial Africa. The constitution did not, however, grant full self-government. Executive power remained in the hands of the governor, to whom the Legislative Council was responsible. Hence, the constitution, although greeted with enthusiasm as a significant milestone, soon encountered trouble. World War II had just ended, and many Gold Coast veterans who had served in British overseas expeditions returned to a country beset with shortages, inflation, unemployment, and black-market practices. There veterans, along with discontented urban elements, formed a nucleus of malcontents ripe for disruptive action. They were now joined by farmers, who resented drastic governmental measures required to cut out diseased cacao trees in order to control an epidemic, and by many others who were unhappy that the end of the war had not been followed by economic improvements.<ref name=emn />\n\n==== Politics of the independence movements ====\nAlthough political organizations had existed in the British colony, the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC), founded on 4 August 1947 by educated Ghanaians known as [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six]], was the first nationalist movement with the aim of self-government \"in the shortest possible time.\" It called for the replacement of chiefs on the Legislative Council with educated persons. They also demanded that, given their education, the colonial administration should respect them and accord them positions of responsibility. In particular, the UGCC leadership criticized the government for its failure to solve the problems of unemployment, inflation, and the disturbances that had come to characterize the society at the end of the war. Though they opposed the colonial administration, UGCC members did not seek drastic or revolutionary change. Public dissatisfaction with the UGCC expressed itself on February 28, 1948 as a demonstration of ex-servicemen organized by the ex-serviceman's union paraded through Accra.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', pp. 364\u2013365.</ref> To disperse the demonstrators, police fired on them killing three ex-servicemen and wounding sixty. Five days of violent disorder followed in Accra in response to the shooting and rioters broke into and looted the shops owned by Europeans and Syrians.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 365\">Hallet, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 365.</ref> Rioting also broke out in Kumasi and other towns across the Gold Coast. The Big Six including Nkrumah were imprisoned by the British authorities from 12 March to 12 April 1948. The police shooting and the resultant riots indicated that the gentlemanly manner in which politics had been conducted by the UGCC was irrelevant in the new post-war world. This change in the dynamics of politics of the Gold Coast was not lost on [[Kwame Nkrumah]] who broke with the UGCC publicly during its Easter Convention in 1949, and created his [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP) on 12 June 1949.<ref name=pim>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Politics of the Independence Movements\".</ref>\n\nAfter his brief tenure with the UGCC, the US- and British-educated Nkrumah broke with the organization over his frustration at the UGCC's weak attempts to solve the problems of the Gold Coast colony by negotiating another new conciliatory colonial constitution with the British colonial authority.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 365\" /> Unlike the UGCC's call for self-government \"in the shortest possible time,\" Nkrumah and the CPP asked for \"self-government now.\" The party leadership identified itself more with ordinary working people than with the UGCC and its intelligentsia, and the movement found support among workers, farmers, youths, and market women. The politicized population consisted largely of ex-servicemen, literate persons, journalists, and elementary school teachers, all of whom had developed a taste for populist conceptions of democracy. A growing number of uneducated but urbanized industrial workers also formed part of the support group. By June 1949, Nkrumah had a mass following.<ref name=pim />\n\nThe constitution of January 1, 1951, resulted from the report of the Coussey Committee, created because of [[Accra Riots|disturbances in Accra]] and other cities in 1948. In addition to giving the Executive Council a large majority of African ministers, it created an assembly, half the elected members of which were to come from the towns and rural districts and half from the traditional councils. Although it was an enormous step forward, the new constitution still fell far short of the CPP's call for full self-government. Executive power remained in British hands, and the legislature was tailored to permit control by traditionalist interests.<ref name=pim />\n\nWith increasing popular backing, the CPP in early 1950 initiated a campaign of \"[[Positive Action]]\" intended to instigate widespread strikes and nonviolent resistance. When some violent disorders occurred on January 20, 1950, Nkrumah was arrested and imprisoned for sedition. This merely established him as a leader and hero, building popular support, and when the first elections were held for the Legislative Assembly under the new constitution from February 5\u201310, 1951, Nkrumah (still in jail) won a seat, and the CPP won a two-thirds majority of votes cast winning 34 of the 38 elected seats in the Assembly.  Nkrumah was released from jail on 11 February 1951, and the following day accepted an invitation to form a government as \"leader of government business,\" a position similar to that of prime minister. The start of Nkrumah's first term was marked by cooperation with the British governor. During the next few years, the government was gradually transformed into a full [[Parliament of Ghana|parliamentary system]]. The changes were opposed by the more traditionalist African elements, though opposition proved ineffective in the face of popular support for independence at an early date.<ref name=pim />\n\nOn March 10, 1952, the new position of prime minister was created, and Nkrumah was elected to the post by the Assembly. At the same time the Executive Council became the cabinet. The new constitution of 5 May 1954 ended the election of assembly members by the tribal councils. The Legislative Assembly increased in size, and all members were chosen by direct election from equal, single-member constituencies. Only defense and foreign policy remained in the hands of the governor; the elected assembly was given control of virtually all internal affairs of the colony.<ref name=pim /> The CPP won 71 of the 104 seats in the 15 June 1954 election.\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-45.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] household comprising husband, wife and three children in [[Yendi]], 1957.]]\nThe CPP pursued a policy of political centralization, which encountered serious opposition. Shortly after the [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1954|15 June 1954 election]], a new party, the Ashanti-based [[National Liberation Movement (Ghana)|National Liberation Movement]] (NLM), was formed. The NLM advocated a federal form of government, with increased powers for the various regions. NLM leaders criticized the CPP for perceived dictatorial tendencies. The new party worked in cooperation with another regionalist group, the Northern People's Party. When these two regional parties walked out of discussions on a new constitution, the CPP feared that London might consider such disunity an indication that the colony was not yet ready for the next phase of self-government.<ref name=pim />\n\nThe British constitutional adviser, however, backed the CPP position. The governor dissolved the assembly in order to test popular support for the CPP demand for immediate independence. On 11 May 1956 the British agreed to grant independence if so requested by a 'reasonable' majority of the new legislature.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40616FC3D5F107A93C0A8178ED85F428585F9 Kennett Love, \"BRITAIN PROMISES FREE GOLD COAST; African Colony Is Offered Independence as Soon as New Legislature Asks It\"], ''The New York Times'', 12 May 1956.</ref> [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1956|New elections]] were held on 17 July 1956.

The dominant ethnic group, the [[Ewe people]], were divided between the two [[Togo]]s.

When local CPP supporters gained control of enough regional assemblies, however, the Nkrumah government promptly secured passage of an act removing the special entrenchment protection clause in the constitution, a step that left the National Assembly with the power to effect any constitutional change the CPP deemed necessary.<ref name=ig />\n\nThe electoral victory of the CCP in 1951 ushered in five years of power-sharing with the British.

These writings show the impact of his stay in Britain in the mid-1940s. The pan-Africanist movement, which had held one of its annual conferences, attended by Nkrumah, at Manchester in 1945, was influenced by socialist ideologies. The movement sought unity among people of African descent and also improvement in the lives of workers who, it was alleged, had been exploited by capitalist enterprises in Africa. Western countries with colonial histories were identified as the exploiters. According to the socialists, \"oppressed\" people ought to identify with the socialist countries and organizations that best represented their interests; however, all the dominant world powers in the immediate post-1945 period, except the Soviet Union and the United States, had colonial ties with Africa. Nkrumah asserted that even the United States, which had never colonized any part of Africa, was in an advantageous position to exploit independent Africa unless preventive efforts were taken.<ref name=\"nga\">McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Nkrumah, Ghana, and Africa\".</ref>\n\nAccording to Nkrumah, his government, which represented the first black African nation to win independence, had an important role to play in the struggle against capitalist interests on the continent. As he put it, \"the independence of Ghana would be meaningless unless it was tied to the total liberation of Africa.\" It was important, then, he said, for Ghanaians to \"seek first the political kingdom.\" Economic benefits associated with independence were to be enjoyed later, proponents of Nkrumah's position argued. But Nkrumah needed strategies to pursue his goals.<ref name=nga />\n\nOn the continental level, Nkrumah sought to unite Africa so that it could defend its international economic interests and stand up against the political pressures from East and West that were a result of the Cold War. His dream for Africa was a continuation of the pan-Africanist dream as expressed at the Manchester conference. The initial strategy was to encourage revolutionary political movements in Africa. The CIA believed that Nkrumah's government provided money and training for pro-socialist guerrillas in Ghana, aided after 1964 by the Chinese Communist government. Several hundred trainees passed through this program, administered by Nkrumah's Bureau of African Affairs, and were sent on to countries such as Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, Niger and Congo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/im-ghanas-freedom-fighters-camp-and-chinese-communists|title=IM:  GHANA'S FREEDOM FIGHTERS' CAMP AND THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref> Politically, Nkrumah believed that a Ghana, Guinea, and Mali union would serve as the psychological and political impetus for the formation of a [[United States of Africa]]. When Nkrumah was criticized for paying little attention to Ghana or for wasting national resources in supporting external programmes, he reversed the argument and accused his opponents of being short-sighted.<ref name=nga />\n\n===Tax protests===\nThe heavy financial burdens created by Nkrumah's development policies and pan-African adventures created new sources of opposition. With the presentation in July 1961 of the country's first austerity budget, Ghana's workers and farmers became aware of and critical of the cost to them of Nkrumah's programmes. Their reaction set the model for the protests over taxes and benefits that were to dominate Ghanaian political crises for the next thirty years.<ref name=nga />\n\nCPP backbenchers and UP representatives in the National Assembly sharply criticized the government's demand for increased taxes and, particularly, for a forced savings programme. Urban workers began a protest strike, the most serious of a number of public outcries against government measures during 1961. Nkrumah's public demands for an end to corruption in the government and the party further undermined popular faith in the national government. A drop in the price paid to cocoa farmers by the government marketing board aroused resentment among a segment of the population that had always been Nkrumah's major opponent.<ref name=nga />\n\n=== Growth of opposition to Nkrumah ===\nNkrumah's complete domination of political power had served to isolate lesser leaders, leaving each a real or imagined challenger to the ruler. After opposition parties were crushed, opponents came only from within the CPP hierarchy. Among its members was [[Tawia Adamafio]], an Accra politician. Nkrumah had made him general secretary of the CPP for a brief time. Later, Adamafio was appointed minister of state for presidential affairs, the most important post in the president's staff at Flagstaff House, which gradually became the centre for all decision making and much of the real administrative machinery for both the CPP and the government. The other leader with an apparently autonomous base was John Tettegah, leader of the Trade Union Congress. Neither, however, proved to have any power other than that granted to them by the president.<ref name=gon>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Growth of Opposition to Nkrumah\".</ref>\n\nBy 1961, however, the young and more radical members of the CPP leadership, led by Adamafio, had gained ascendancy over the original CPP leaders like Gbedemah. After a bomb attempt on Nkrumah's life in August 1962, Adamafio, Ako Adjei (then minister of foreign affairs), and Cofie Crabbe (all members of the CPP) were jailed under the Preventive Detention Act. The first Ghanaian Commissioner  of Police, E. R. T Madjitey, from Asite in Manya-Krobo was also relieved of his post. The CPP newspapers charged them with complicity in the assassination attempt, offering as evidence only the fact that they had all chosen to ride in cars far behind the president's when the bomb was thrown.<ref name=gon />\n\nFor more than a year, the trial of the alleged plotters of the 1962 assassination attempt occupied centre stage. The accused were brought to trial before the three-judge court for state security, headed by the chief justice, Sir [[Kobina Arku Korsah|Arku Korsah]]. When the court acquitted the accused, Nkrumah used his constitutional prerogative to dismiss Korsah. Nkrumah then obtained a vote from the parliament that allowed retrial of Adamafio and his associates. A new court, with a jury chosen by Nkrumah, found all the accused guilty and sentenced them to death. These sentences, however, were commuted to twenty years' imprisonment.<ref name=gon />\n\nCorruption had highly deleterious effects.  It removed money from the active economy and put it in the hands of the political parties, and Nkrumah's friends and family, so it became an obstacle to economic growth. The new state companies that had been formed to implement growth became instruments of patronage and financial corruption; civil servants doubled their salaries and politicians purchase supporters. Politically, allegations and instances of corruption in the ruling party, and in Nkrumah's personal finances, undermined the very legitimacy of his regime and sharply decreased the ideological commitment needed to maintain the public welfare under Ghanaian socialism.<ref>John Mukum Mbaku, \"Corruption in Africa\u2013Part 1.\" ''History Compass'' 7.5 (2009): 1269-1285.</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Herbert H. Werlin Has examined the mounting economic disaster:\n: Nkrumah left Ghana with a serious balance-of-payments problem. Beginning with a substantial foreign reserve fund of over $500 million at the time of independence, Ghana, by 1966, had a public external debt of over $800 million.....there was no foreign exchange to buy the spare parts and raw materials required for the economy. While inflation was rampant, causing  the price-level to rise by 30 per cent in 1964-65, unemployment was also serious....Whereas between 1955 and 1962 Ghana's GNP increased at an  average annual rate of nearly 5 per cent, there was practically no  growth at all by 1965....Since Ghana's estimated annual rate of population growth was 2.6 per cent, her economy was obviously retrogressing.  While personal per capita consumption declined by some 15 per cent between 1960 and 1966, the real wage income of the minimum wage earner declined by some 45 per cent during this period.<ref>Herbert H.

Ghana officially became a [[one-party state]] and an act of parliament ensured that there would be only one candidate for president. Other parties having already been outlawed, no non-CPP candidates came forward to challenge the party slate in the general elections announced for June 1965. Nkrumah had been re-elected president of the country for less than a year when members of the National Liberation Council (NLC) overthrew the CPP government in a military coup on 24 February 1966. At the time, Nkrumah was in China. He took up asylum in Guinea, where he remained until he died in 1972.<ref name=gon /><ref>Albert Kwasi Ocran, ''A myth is broken: an account of the Ghana coup d'\u00e9tat of 24th February, 1966'' (Longmans, 1968).</ref>\n\n== Since 1966==\n{{Main|History of Ghana (1966\u20131979)}}\nLeaders of the 1966 military coup justified their takeover by charging that the CPP administration was abusive and corrupt, that Nkrumah's involvement in African politics was overly aggressive, and that the nation lacked democratic practices. They claimed that the military coup of 1966 was a nationalist one because it liberated the nation from Nkrumah's dictatorship. All symbols and organizations linked to Nkrumah quickly vanished, such as the Young Pioneers.<ref>Goody (1968) pp 338-39.</ref>  Despite the vast political changes that were brought about by the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah, many problems remained, including ethnic and regional divisions, the country's economic burdens, and mixed emotions about a resurgence of an overly strong central authority. A considerable portion of the population had become convinced that effective, honest government was incompatible with competitive political parties. Many Ghanaians remained committed to nonpolitical leadership for the nation, even in the form of military rule. The problems of the Busia administration, the country's first elected government after Nkrumah's fall, illustrated the problems Ghana would continue to face.<ref name=fnr>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Fall of the Nkrumah Regime and its Aftermath\".</ref> It has been argued that the coup was supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency;<ref>Interview with [[John Stockwell (CIA officer)|John Stockwell]] in ''[[PandoNkrumah was overthrown by a military coup in 1966.ra's Box (television documentary series)|Pandora's Box]]: Black Power'' ([[Adam Curtis]], BBC Two, 22 June 1992).</ref><ref>[https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xxiv/s.html Foreign Relations of The United States 1964\u20131968, Volume XXIV].

It appointed a cabinet of civil servants and promised to restore democratic government as quickly as possible. These moves culminated in the appointment of a representative assembly to draft a constitution for the Second Republic of Ghana. Political parties were allowed to operate beginning in late 1968. In Ghana's [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1969|1969 elections]], the first competitive nationwide political contest since 1956, the major contenders were the Progress Party (PP), headed by [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]], and the [[National Alliance of Liberals]] (NAL), led by [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah|Komla A. Gbedemah]]. The PP found much of its support among the old opponents of Nkrumah's CPP \u2013 the educated middle class and traditionalists of the Ashanti Region and the North. The NAL was seen as the successor of the CPP's right wing. Overall, the PP gained 59 percent of the popular vote and 74 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.<ref name=nlc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The National Liberation Council and the Busia Years, 1966\u201371\".</ref>\n\nGbedemah, who was soon barred from taking his National Assembly seat by a [[Supreme Court of Ghana|Supreme Court]] decision, retired from politics, leaving the NAL without a strong leader. In October 1970, the NAL absorbed the members of three other minor parties in the assembly to form the [[Justice Party (Ghana)|Justice Party]] (JP) under the leadership of [[Joe Appiah|Joseph Appiah]]. Their combined strength constituted what amounted to a southern bloc with a solid constituency among most of the Ewe and the peoples of the coastal cities.<ref name=nlc />\n\nPP leader Busia became prime minister in September 1970. After a brief period under an interim three-member presidential commission, the electoral college chose as president Chief Justice [[Edward Akufo-Addo]], one of the leading nationalist politicians of the UGCC era and one of the judges dismissed by Nkrumah in 1964.<ref name=nlc />\n\nAll attention, however, remained focused on Prime Minister Busia and his government. Much was expected of the Busia administration, because its parliamentarians were considered intellectuals and, therefore, more perceptive in their evaluations of what needed to be done. Many Ghanaians hoped that their decisions would be in the general interest of the nation, as compared with those made by the Nkrumah administration, which were judged to satisfy narrow party interests and, more important, Nkrumah's personal agenda. The NLC had given assurances that there would be more democracy, more political maturity, and more freedom in Ghana, because the politicians allowed to run for the 1969 elections were proponents of Western democracy. In fact, these were the same individuals who had suffered under the old regime and were, therefore, thought to understand the benefits of democracy.<ref name=nlc />\n\nTwo early measures initiated by the Busia government were the expulsion of large numbers of non-citizens from the country and a companion measure to limit foreign involvement in small businesses. The moves were aimed at relieving the unemployment created by the country's precarious economic situation. The policies were popular because they forced out of the retail sector of the economy those foreigners, especially Lebanese, Asians, and Nigerians, who were perceived as unfairly monopolizing trade to the disadvantage of Ghanaians. Many other Busia moves, however, were not popular. Busia's decision to introduce a loan programme for university students, who had hitherto received free education, was challenged because it was interpreted as introducing a class system into the country's highest institutions of learning. Some observers even saw Busia's devaluation of the national currency and his encouragement of foreign investment in the industrial sector of the economy as conservative ideas that could undermine Ghana's sovereignty.<ref name=nlc />\n\nThe opposition Justice Party's basic policies did not differ significantly from those of the Busia administration. Still, the party attempted to stress the importance of the central government rather than that of limited private enterprise in economic development, and it continued to emphasize programmes of primary interest to the urban work force. The ruling PP emphasized the need for development in rural areas, both to slow the movement of population to the cities and to redress regional imbalance in levels of development. The JP and a growing number of PP members favoured suspension of payment on some foreign debts of the Nkrumah era. This attitude grew more popular as debt payments became more difficult to meet. Both parties favoured creation of a West African economic community or an economic union with the neighboring West African states.<ref name=nlc />\n\nDespite broad popular support garnered at its inception and strong foreign connections, the Busia government fell victim to an army coup within twenty-seven months. Neither ethnic nor class differences played a role in the overthrow of the PP government. The crucial causes were the country's continuing economic difficulties, both those stemming from the high foreign debts incurred by Nkrumah and those resulting from internal problems. The PP government had inherited US$580 million in medium- and long-term debts, an amount equal to 25 percent of the gross domestic product of 1969. By 1971 the US$580 million had been further inflated by US$72 million in accrued interest payments and US$296 million in short-term commercial credits. Within the country, an even larger internal debt fueled inflation.<ref name=nlc />\n\nGhana's economy remained largely dependent upon the often difficult cultivation of and market for cocoa. Cocoa prices had always been volatile, but exports of this tropical crop normally provided about half of the country's foreign currency earnings. Beginning in the 1960s, however, a number of factors combined to limit severely this vital source of national income. These factors included foreign competition (particularly from neighboring C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), a lack of understanding of free-market forces (by the government in setting prices paid to farmers), accusations of bureaucratic incompetence in the Cocoa Marketing Board, and the smuggling of crops into C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. As a result, Ghana's income from cocoa exports continued to fall dramatically.<ref name=nlc />\n\nAusterity measures imposed by the Busia administration, although wise in the long run, alienated influential farmers, who until then had been PP supporters. These measures were part of Busia's economic structural adjustment efforts to put the country on a sounder financial base. The austerity programmes had been recommended by the International Monetary Fund. The recovery measures also severely affected the middle class and the salaried work force, both of which faced wage freezes, tax increases, currency devaluations, and rising import prices. These measures precipitated protests from the Trade Union Congress. In response, the government sent the army to occupy the trade union headquarters and to block strike actions\u2014a situation that some perceived as negating the government's claim to be operating democratically.<ref name=nlc />\n\nThe army troops and officers upon whom Busia relied for support were themselves affected, both in their personal lives and in the tightening of the defense budget, by these same austerity measures. As the leader of the anti-Busia coup declared on January 13, 1972, even those amenities enjoyed by the army during the Nkrumah regime were no longer available. Knowing that austerity had alienated the officers, the Busia government began to change the leadership of the army's combat elements. This, however, was the last straw. Lieutenant Colonel [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]], temporarily commanding the First Brigade around Accra, led a bloodless coup that ended the Second Republic.<ref name=nlc />\n\n=== National Redemption Council years, 1972\u201379 ===\nDespite its short existence, the Second Republic was significant in that the development problems the nation faced came clearly into focus. These included uneven distribution of investment funds and favouritism toward certain groups and regions. Important questions about developmental priorities remained unanswered, and after the failure of both the Nkrumah and the Busia regimes (one a one-party state, and the other a multi-party parliamentary democracy) Ghana's path to political stability was obscure.<ref name=nrc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The National Redemption Council Years, 1972\u201379\".</ref>\n\nAcheampong's National Redemption Council (NRC) claimed that it had to act to remove the ill effects of the currency devaluation of the previous government and thereby, at least in the short run, to improve living conditions for individual Ghanaians. To justify their takeover, coup leaders leveled charges of corruption against Busia and his ministers. The NRC sought to create a truly military government and did not outline any plan for the return of the nation to democratic rule.<ref name=nrc />\n\nIn matters of economic policy, Busia's austerity measures were reversed, the Ghanaian currency was revalued upward, foreign debt was repudiated or unilaterally rescheduled, and all large foreign-owned companies were nationalized. The government also provided price supports for basic food imports, while seeking to encourage Ghanaians to become self-reliant in agriculture and the production of raw materials. These measures, while instantly popular, did nothing to solve the country's problems and in fact aggravated the problem of capital flow. Any economic successes were overridden by other basic economic factors. Industry and transportation suffered greatly as oil prices rose in 1974, and the lack of foreign exchange and credit left the country without fuel. Basic food production continued to decline even as the population grew. Disillusionment with the government developed, and accusations of corruption began to surface.<ref name=nrc />\n\nThe reorganization of the NRC into the Supreme Military Council (SMC) in 1975 may have been part of a face-saving attempt. Little input from the civilian sector was allowed, and military officers were put in charge of all ministries and state enterprises down to the local level. During the NRC's early years, these administrative changes led many Ghanaians to hope that the soldiers in command would improve the efficiency of the country's bloated bureaucracies.<ref name=nrc />\n\nShortly after that time, the government sought to stifle opposition by issuing a decree forbidding the propagation of rumors and by banning a number of independent newspapers and detaining their journalists. Also, armed soldiers broke up student demonstrations, and the government repeatedly closed the universities, which had become important centres of opposition to NRC policies. The self-appointed Ashanti General I. K. Acheampong seemed to have much sympathy for women than his ailing economic policies. As the Commissioner(Minister) of Finance, he signed Government checks to concubines and other ladies he barely knew. VW Gulf cars were imported and given to beautiful ladies he came across. Import licenses were given out to friends and ethnic affiliates with impunity.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe SMC by 1977 found itself constrained by mounting non-violent opposition. To be sure, discussions about the nation's political future and its relationship to the SMC had begun in earnest. Although the various opposition groups (university students, lawyers, and other organized civilian groups) called for a return to civilian constitutional rule, Acheampong and the SMC favoured a union government\u2014a mixture of elected civilian and appointed military leaders\u2014but one in which party politics would be abolished. University students and many intellectuals criticized the union government idea, but others, such as Justice [[Gustav Koranteng-Addow]], who chaired the seventeen-member ad hoc committee appointed by the government to work out details of the plan, defended it as the solution to the nation's political problems. Supporters of the union government idea viewed multiparty political contests as the perpetrators of social tension and community conflict among classes, regions, and ethnic groups. Unionists argued that their plan had the potential to depoliticize public life and to allow the nation to concentrate its energies on economic problems.<ref name=nrc />\n\nA national referendum was held in March 1978 to allow the people to accept or reject the union government concept. A rejection of the union government meant a continuation of military rule. Given this choice, it was surprising that so narrow a margin voted in favour of union government. Opponents of the idea organized demonstrations against the government, arguing that the referendum vote had not been free or fair. The Acheampong government reacted by banning several organizations and by jailing as many as 300 of its opponents.<ref name=nrc />\n\nThe agenda for change in the union government referendum called for the drafting of a new constitution by an SMC-appointed commission, the selection of a constituent assembly by November 1978, and general elections in June 1979. The ad hoc committee had recommended a nonparty election, an elected executive president, and a cabinet whose members would be drawn from outside a single-house National Assembly. The military council would then step down, although its members could run for office as individuals.<ref name=nrc />\n\nIn July 1978, in a sudden move, the other SMC officers forced Acheampong to resign, replacing him with Lieutenant General [[Fred Akuffo|Frederick W. K. Akuffo]]. The SMC apparently acted in response to continuing pressure to find a solution to the country's economic dilemma. Inflation was estimated to be as high as 300 percent that year. There were shortages of basic commodities, and cocoa production fell to half its 1964 peak. The council was also motivated by Acheampong's failure to dampen rising political pressure for changes. Akuffo, the new SMC chairman, promised publicly to hand over political power to a new government to be elected by 1 July 1979.<ref name=nrc />\n\nDespite Akuffo's assurances, opposition to the SMC persisted. The call for the formation of political parties intensified. In an effort to gain support in the face of continuing strikes over economic and political issues, the Akuffo government at length announced that the formation of political parties would be allowed after January 1979. Akuffo also granted amnesty to former members of both Nkrumah's CPP and Busia's PP, as well as to all those convicted of subversion under Acheampong. The decree lifting the ban on party politics went into effect on 1 January 1979, as planned. The constitutional assembly that had been working on a new constitution presented an approved draft and adjourned in May. All appeared set for a new attempt at constitutional government in July, when a group of young army officers overthrew the SMC government in June 1979.<ref name=nrc />\n\n=== The Rawlings era ===\nOn 15 May 1979, less than five weeks before constitutional elections were to be held, a group of junior officers led by Flight Lieutenant [[Jerry John Rawlings]] attempted a coup. Initially unsuccessful, the coup leaders were jailed and held for [[court-martial]]. On 4 June, however, sympathetic military officers overthrew the Akuffo regime and released Rawlings and his cohorts from prison fourteen days before the scheduled election. Although the SMC's pledge to return political power to civilian hands addressed the concerns of those who wanted civilian government, the young officers who had staged the June 4 coup insisted that issues critical to the image of the army and important for the stability of national politics had been ignored. [[Naomi Chazan]], a leading analyst of Ghanaian politics, aptly assessed the significance of the 1979 coup in the following statement:<ref name=re>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Ghana and the Rawlings Era\".</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Unlike the initial SMC II [the Akuffo period, 1978\u20131979] rehabilitation effort which focused on the power elite, this second attempt at reconstruction from a situation of disintegration was propelled by growing alienation. It strove, by reforming the guidelines of public behavior, to define anew the state power structure and to revise its inherent social obligations.... In retrospect the most irreversible outcome of this phase was the systematic eradication of the SMC leadership.... [Their] executions signaled not only the termination of the already fallacious myth of the nonviolence of Ghanaian politics, but, more to the point, the deadly serious determination of the new government to wipe the political slate clean.<ref name=re /></blockquote>\n\nRawlings and the young officers formed the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). The armed forces were purged of senior officers accused of corrupting the image of the military. In carrying out its goal, however, the AFRC was caught between two groups with conflicting interests, Chazan observed. These included the \"soldier-supporters of the AFRC who were happy to lash out at all manifestations of the old regimes; and the now organized political parties who decried the undue violence and advocated change with restraint.<ref name=re />\n\nDespite the coup and the subsequent executions of former heads of military governments (Afrifa of the NLC; Acheampong and some of his associates of the NRC; and Akuffo and leading members of the SMC), the planned elections took place, and Ghana had returned to constitutional rule by the end of September 1979. Before power was granted to the elected government, however, the AFRC sent the unambiguous message that \"people dealing with the public, in whatever capacity, are subject to popular supervision, must abide by fundamental notions of probity, and have an obligation to put the good of the community above personal objective.\" The AFRC position was that the nation's political leaders, at least those from within the military, had not been accountable to the people. The administration of Hilla Limann, inaugurated on 24 September 1979, at the beginning of the Third Republic, was thus expected to measure up to the new standard advocated by the AFRC.<ref name=re />\n\nLimann's People's National Party (PNP) began the Third Republic with control of only seventy-one of the 140 legislative seats. The opposition Popular Front Party (PFP) won forty-two seats, while twenty-six elective positions were distributed among three lesser parties. The percentage of the electorate that voted had fallen to 40 percent. Unlike the country's previous elected leaders, Limann was a former diplomat and a noncharismatic figure with no personal following. As Limann himself observed, the ruling PNP included people of conflicting ideological orientations. They sometimes disagreed strongly among themselves on national policies. Many observers, therefore, wondered whether the new government was equal to the task confronting the state.<ref name=re />\n\nThe most immediate threat to the Limann administration, however, was the AFRC, especially those officers who organized themselves into the \"June 4 Movement\" to monitor the civilian administration. In an effort to keep the AFRC from looking over its shoulder, the government ordered Rawlings and several other army and police officers associated with the AFRC into retirement; nevertheless, Rawlings and his associates remained a latent threat, particularly as the economy continued its decline. The first Limann budget, for fiscal year (FY\u2014see Glossary) 1981, estimated the Ghanaian inflation rate at 70 percent for that year, with a budget deficit equal to 30 percent of the gross national product (GNP\u2014see Glossary). The Trade Union Congress claimed that its workers were no longer earning enough to pay for food, let alone anything else. A rash of strikes, many considered illegal by the government, resulted, each one lowering productivity and therefore national income. In September the government announced that all striking public workers would be dismissed. These factors rapidly eroded the limited support the Limann government enjoyed among civilians and soldiers. The government fell on 31 December 1981, in another Rawlings-led coup.<ref name=re />\n\nRawlings and his colleagues suspended the 1979 constitution, dismissed the president and his cabinet, dissolved the parliament, and proscribed existing political parties. They established the [[Provisional National Defense Council]] (PNDC), initially composed of seven members with Rawlings as chairman, to exercise executive and legislative powers. The existing judicial system was preserved, but alongside it the PNDC created the National Investigation Committee to root out corruption and other economic offenses, the anonymous <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[Citizens' Vetting Committee]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->''Citizens' Vetting Committee'' to punish tax evasion, and the Public Tribunals to try various crimes. The PNDC proclaimed its intent to allow the people to exercise political power through defense committees to be established in communities, workplaces, and in units of the armed forces and police. Under the PNDC, Ghana remained a unitary government.<ref name=re />\n\nIn December 1982, the PNDC announced a plan to decentralize government from Accra to the regions, the districts, and local communities, but it maintained overall control by appointing regional and district secretaries who exercised executive powers and also chaired regional and district councils. Local councils, however, were expected progressively to take over the payment of salaries, with regions and districts assuming more powers from the national government. In 1984, the PNDC created a National Appeals Tribunal to hear appeals from the public tribunals, changed the Citizens' Vetting Committee into the Office of Revenue Collection and replaced the system of defense committees with Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.<ref name=re />\n\nIn 1984, the PNDC also created a National Commission on Democracy to study ways to establish participatory democracy in Ghana. The commission issued a \"Blue Book\" in July 1987 outlining modalities for district-level elections, which were held in late 1988 and early 1989, for newly created district assemblies. One-third of the assembly members are appointed by the government.<ref name=re />\n\n==== The second coming of Rawlings: the first six years, 1982\u201387 ====\nThe new government that took power on 31 December 1981, was the eighth in the fifteen years since the fall of Nkrumah. Calling itself the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC), its membership included Rawlings as chairman, Brigadier Joseph Nunoo-Mensah (whom Limann had dismissed as army commander), two other officers, and three civilians. Despite its military connections, the PNDC made it clear that it was unlike other soldier-led governments. This was immediately proved by the appointment of fifteen civilians to cabinet positions.<ref name=scr>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The second coming of Rawlings: the first six years, 1982\u201387\".</ref>\n\nIn a radio broadcast on 5 January 1982, Rawlings presented a detailed statement explaining the factors that had necessitated termination of the Third Republic. The PNDC chairman assured the people that he had no intention of imposing himself on Ghanaians. Rather, he \"wanted a chance for the people, farmers, workers, soldiers, the rich and the poor, to be part of the decision-making process.\" He described the two years since the AFRC had handed over power to a civilian government as a period of regression during which political parties attempted to divide the people in order to rule them. The ultimate purpose for the return of Rawlings was, therefore, to \"restore human dignity to Ghanaians.\" In the chairman's words, the dedication of the PNDC to achieving its goals was different from any the country had ever known. It was for that reason that the takeover was not a military coup, but rather a \"holy war\" that would involve the people in the transformation of the socioeconomic structure of the society. The PNDC also served notice to friends and foes alike that any interference in the PNDC agenda would be \"fiercely resisted.\"<ref name=scr />\n\nOpposition to the PNDC administration developed nonetheless in different sectors of the political spectrum. The most obvious groups opposing the government were former PNP and PFP members. They argued that the Third Republic had not been given time to prove itself and that the PNDC administration was unconstitutional. Further opposition came from the [[Ghana Bar Association]] (GBA), which criticized the government's use of people's tribunals in the administration of justice. Members of the Trade Union Congress were also angered when the PNDC ordered them to withdraw demands for increased wages. The National Union of Ghanaian Students (NUGS) went even farther, calling on the government to hand over power to the attorney general, who would supervise new elections.<ref name=scr />\n\nBy the end of June 1982, an attempted coup had been discovered, and those implicated had been executed. Many who disagreed with the PNDC administration were driven into exile, where they began organizing their opposition. They accused the government of human rights abuses and political intimidation, which forced the country, especially the press, into a \"culture of silence.\"<ref name=scr />\n\nMeanwhile, the PNDC was subjected to the influence of contrasting political philosophies and goals. Although the revolutionary leaders agreed on the need for radical change, they differed on the means of achieving it. For example, John Ndebugre, secretary for agriculture in the PNDC government, who was later appointed northern regional secretary (governor), belonged to the radical Kwame Nkrumah Revolutionary Guard, an extreme left-wing organization that advocated a Marxist\u2013Leninist course for the PNDC. He was detained and jailed for most of the latter part of the 1980s. Other members of the PNDC, including Kojo Tsikata, P.V. Obeng, and Kwesi Botchwey, were believed to be united only by their determination either to uplift the country from its desperate conditions or to protect themselves from vocal opposition.<ref name=scr />\n\nIn keeping with Rawlings's commitment to populism as a political principle, the PNDC began to form governing coalitions and institutions that would incorporate the populace at large into the machinery of the national government. Workers' Defence Committees (WDCs), People's Defence Committees (PDCs), Citizens' Vetting Committees (CVCs), Regional Defence Committees (RDCs), and National Defence Committees (NDCs) were all created to ensure that those at the bottom of society were given the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. These committees were to be involved in community projects and community decisions, and individual members were expected to expose corruption and \"anti-social activities\". Public tribunals, which were established outside the normal legal system, were also created to try those accused of antigovernment acts. And a four-week workshop aimed at making these cadres morally and intellectually prepared for their part in the revolution was completed at the University of Ghana, Legon, in July and August 1983.<ref name=scr />\n\nVarious opposition groups criticized the PDCs and WDCs, however. The aggressiveness of certain WDCs, it was argued, interfered with management's ability to make the bold decisions needed for the recovery of the national economy. In response to such criticisms, the PNDC announced on 1 December 1984, the dissolution of all PDCs, WDCs, and NDCs, and their replacement with Committees for the Defence of the Revolution (CDRs). With regard to public boards and statutory corporations, excluding banks and financial institutions, Joint Consultative Committees (JCCs) that acted as advisory bodies to managing directors were created.<ref name=scr />\n\nThe public tribunals, however, despite their characterization as undemocratic by the GBA, were maintained. Although the tribunals had been established in 1982, the law providing for the creation of a national public tribunal to hear and determine appeals from, and decisions of, regional public tribunals was not passed until August 1984. Section 3 and Section 10 of the PNDC Establishment Proclamation limited public tribunals to cases of a political and an economic nature. The limitations placed on public tribunals by the government in 1984 may have been an attempt by the administration to redress certain weaknesses. The tribunals, however, were not abolished; rather, they were defended as \"fundamental to a good legal system\" that needed to be maintained in response to \"growing legal consciousness on the part of the people.\"<ref name=scr />\n\nAt the time when the foundations of these sociopolitical institutions were being laid, the PNDC was also engaged in a debate about how to finance the reconstruction of the national economy. The country had indeed suffered from what some described as the excessive and unwise, if not foolish, expenditures of the Nkrumah regime. The degree of decline under the NRC and the SMC had also been devastating. By December 1981, when the PNDC came to power, the inflation rate topped 200 percent, while real GDP had declined by 3 percent per annum for seven years. Not only cocoa production but even diamonds and timber exports had dropped dramatically. Gold production had also fallen to half its preindependence level.<ref name=scr />\n\nGhana's sorry economic condition, according to the PNDC, had resulted in part from the absence of good political leadership. In fact, as early as the AFRC administration in 1979, Rawlings and his associates had accused three former military leaders (generals Afrifa, Acheampong, and Akuffo) of corruption and greed and of thereby contributing to the national crisis and had executed them on the basis of this accusation. In other words, the AFRC in 1979 attributed the national crisis to internal, primarily political, causes. The overthrow of the Limann administration by the PNDC in 1981 was an attempt to prevent another inept administration from aggravating an already bad economic situation. By implication, the way to resolve some of the problems was to stabilize the political situation and to improve the economic conditions of the nation radically.<ref name=scr />\n\nAt the end of its first year in power, the PNDC announced a four-year programme of economic austerity and sacrifice that was to be the first phase of an Economic Recovery Programme (ERP). If the economy were to improve significantly, there was need for a large injection of capital\u2014a resource that could only be obtained from international financial institutions of the West. There were those on the PNDC's ideological left, however, who rejected consultation with such agencies because these institutions were blamed in part for the nation's predicament. Precisely because some members of the government also held such views, the PNDC secretary for finance and economic planning, Kwesi Botchwey, felt the need to justify World Bank (see Glossary) assistance to Ghana in 1983:<ref name=scr />\n\n<blockquote>It would be naive and unrealistic for certain sections of the Ghanaian society to think that the request for economic assistance from the World Bank and its affiliates means a sell-out of the aims and objectives of the Ghanaian revolution to the international community.... It does not make sense for the country to become a member of the bank and the IMF and continue to pay its dues only to decline to utilize the resources of these two institutions.<ref name=scr /></blockquote>\n\nThe PNDC recognized that it could not depend on friendly nations such as Libya to address the economic problems of Ghana. The magnitude of the crisis\u2014made worse by widespread bush fires that devastated crop production in 1983\u20131984 and by the return of more than one million Ghanaians who had been expelled from Nigeria in 1983, which had intensified the unemployment situation\u2014called for monetary assistance from institutions with bigger financial chests.<ref name=scr />\n\nPhase One of the ERP began in 1983. Its goal was economic stability. In broad terms, the government wanted to reduce inflation and to create confidence in the nation's ability to recover. By 1987 progress was clearly evident. The rate of inflation had dropped to 20 percent, and between 1983 and 1987, Ghana's economy reportedly grew at 6 percent per year. Official assistance from donor countries to Ghana's recovery programmeaveraged US$430 million in 1987, more than double that of the preceding years. The PNDC administration also made a remarkable payment of more than US$500 million in loan arrears dating to before 1966. In recognition of these achievements, international agencies had pledged more than US$575 million to the country's future programmes by May 1987. With these accomplishments in place, the PNDC inaugurated Phase Two of the ERP, which envisioned privatization of state-owned assets, currency devaluation, and increased savings and investment, and which was to continue until 1990.<ref name=scr />\n\nNotwithstanding the successes of Phase One of the ERP, many problems remained, and both friends and foes of the PNDC were quick to point them out. One commentator noted the high rate of Ghanaian unemployment as a result of the belt-tightening policies of the PNDC. In the absence of employment or redeployment policies to redress such problems, he wrote, the effects of the austerity programmes might create circumstances that could derail the PNDC recovery agenda.<ref name=scr />\n\nUnemployment was only one aspect of the political problems facing the PNDC government; another was the size and breadth of the PNDC's political base. The PNDC initially espoused a populist programme that appealed to a wide variety of rural and urban constituents. Even so, the PNDC was the object of significant criticism from various groups that in one way or another called for a return to constitutional government. Much of this criticism came from student organizations, the GBA, and opposition groups in self-imposed exile, who questioned the legitimacy of the military government and its declared intention of returning the country to constitutional rule. So vocal was the outcry against the PNDC that it appeared on the surface as if the PNDC enjoyed little support among those groups who had historically moulded and influenced Ghanaian public opinion. At a time when difficult policies were being implemented, the PNDC could ill afford the continued alienation and opposition of such prominent critics.<ref name=scr />\n\nBy the mid-1980s, therefore, it had become essential that the PNDC demonstrate that it was actively considering steps towards constitutionalism and civilian rule. This was true notwithstanding the recognition of Rawlings as an honest leader and the perception that the situation he was trying to redress was not of his creation. To move in the desired direction, the PNDC needed to weaken the influence and credibility of all antagonistic groups while it created the necessary political structures that would bring more and more Ghanaians into the process of national reconstruction. The PNDC's solution to its dilemma was the proposal for district assemblies.<ref name=scr />\n\n==== District assemblies ====\nAlthough the National Commission for Democracy (NCD) had existed as an agency of the PNDC since 1982, it was not until September 1984 that Justice Daniel F. Annan, himself a member of the ruling council, was appointed chairman. The official inauguration of the NCD in January 1985 signaled PNDC determination to move the nation in a new political direction. According to its mandate, the NCD was to devise a viable democratic system, utilizing public discussions. Annan explained the necessity for the commission's work by arguing that the political party system of the past lost track of the country's socio-economic development processes. There was the need, therefore, to search for a new political order that would be functionally democratic. Constitutional rules of the past were not acceptable to the new revolutionary spirit, Annan continued, which saw the old political order as using the ballot box \"merely to ensure that politicians got elected into power, after which communication between the electorate and their elected representative completely broke down.\"<ref name=da>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The District Assemblies\".</ref>\n\nAfter two years of deliberations and public hearings, the NCD recommended the formation of district assemblies as local governing institutions that would offer opportunities to the ordinary person to become involved in the political process. The PNDC scheduled elections of the proposed assemblies for the last quarter of 1988.<ref name=\"da\" />\n\nIf, as Rawlings said, the PNDC revolution was a \"holy war,\" then the proposed assemblies were part of a PNDC policy intended to annihilate enemy forces or, at least, to reduce them to impotence. The strategy was to deny the opposition a legitimate political forum within which it could articulate its objections to the government. It was for this reason, as much as it was for those stated by Annan, that a five-member District Assembly Committee was created in each of the nation's 110 administrative districts and was charged by the NCD with ensuring that all candidates followed electoral rules. The district committees were to disqualify automatically any candidate who had a record of criminal activity, insanity, or imprisonment involving fraud or electoral offenses in the past, especially after 1979. Also barred from elections were all professionals accused of fraud, dishonesty, and malpractice. The ban on political parties, instituted at the time of the Rawlings coup, was to continue.<ref name=da />\n\nBy barring candidates associated with corruption and mismanagement of national resources from running for district assembly positions, the PNDC hoped to establish new values to govern political behaviour in Ghana. To do so effectively, the government also made it illegal for candidates to mount campaign platforms other than the one defined by the NCD. Every person qualified to vote in the district could propose candidates or be nominated as a candidate. Candidates could not be nominated by organizations and associations but had to run for district office on the basis of personal qualifications and service to their communities.<ref name=da />\n\nOnce in session, an assembly was to become the highest political authority in each district. Assembly members were to be responsible for deliberation, evaluation, coordination, and implementation of programmes accepted as appropriate for the district's economic development; however, district assemblies were to be subject to the general guidance and direction of the central government. To ensure that district developments were in line with national policies, one-third of assembly members were to be traditional authorities (chiefs) or their representatives; these members were to be approved by the PNDC in consultation with the traditional authorities and other \"productive economic groups in the district.\" In other words, a degree of autonomy may have been granted to the assemblies in the determination of programmes most suited to the districts, but the PNDC left itself with the ultimate responsibility of making sure that such programmes were in line with the national economic recovery programme.<ref name=da />\n\nDistrict assemblies as outlined in PNDC documents were widely discussed by friends and foes of the government. Some hailed the proposal as compatible with the goal of granting the people opportunities to manage their own affairs, but others (especially those of the political right) accused the government of masking its intention to remain in power. If the government's desire for democracy were genuine, a timetable for national elections should have been its priority rather than the preoccupation with local government, they argued. Some questioned the wisdom of incorporating traditional chiefs and the degree to which these traditional leaders would be committed to the district assembly idea, while others attacked the election guidelines as undemocratic and, therefore, as contributing to a culture of silence in Ghana. To such critics, the district assemblies were nothing but a move by the PNDC to consolidate its position.<ref name=da />\n\nRawlings, however, responded to such criticism by restating the PNDC strategy and the rationale behind it:<ref name=da />\n\n<blockquote>Steps towards more formal political participation are being taken through the district-level elections that we will be holding throughout the country as part of our decentralisation policy. As I said in my nationwide broadcast on December 31, if we are to see a sturdy tree of democracy grow, we need to learn from the past and nurture very carefully and deliberately political institutions that will become the pillars upon which the people's power will be erected. A new sense of responsibility must be created in each workplace, each village, each district; we already see elements of this in the work of the CDRs, the December 31 Women's Movement, the June 4 Movement, Town and Village Development Committees, and other organizations through which the voice of the people is being heard.<ref name=da /></blockquote>\n\nAs for the categorization of certain PNDC policies as \"leftist\" and \"rightist,\" Rawlings dismissed such allegations as \"remarkably simplistic \u2026 What is certain is that we are moving forward!\" For the PNDC, therefore, the district elections constituted an obvious first step in a political process that was to culminate at the national level.<ref name=da />\n\nRawlings's explanation notwithstanding, various opposition groups continued to describe the PNDC-proposed district assemblies as a mere public relations ploy designed to give political legitimacy to a government that had come to power by unconstitutional means. Longtime observers of the Ghanaian political scene, however, identified two major issues at stake in the conflict between the government and its critics: the means by which political stability was to be achieved, and the problem of attaining sustained economic growth. Both had preoccupied the country since the era of Nkrumah. The economic recovery programmes implemented by the PNDC in 1983 and the proposal for district assemblies in 1987 were major elements in the government's strategy to address these fundamental and persistent problems. Both were very much part of the national debate in Ghana in the late 1980s.<ref name=da />\n\n==== End of one-party state ====\n[[File:Ghana's 50th Independence Anniversary.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ghana's 50th Independence Anniversary parade in Accra, March 2007.]]\nUnder international and domestic pressure for a return to democracy, the PNDC allowed the establishment of a 258-member Consultative Assembly made up of members representing geographic districts as well as established civic or business organizations. The assembly was charged to draw up a draft constitution to establish a fourth republic, using PNDC proposals. The PNDC accepted the final product without revision, and it was put to a [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1992|national referendum]] on 28 April 1992, in which it received 92% approval.\n\nOn 18 May 1992, the ban on party politics was lifted in preparation for multi-party elections. The PNDC and its supporters formed a new party, the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] (NDC), to contest the elections. [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1992|Presidential elections]] were held on 3 November and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections]] on 29 December that year. Members of the opposition boycotted the parliamentary elections, however, which resulted in a 200-seat Parliament with only 17 opposition party members and two independents.\n\n=== The Fourth Republic (1993\u2013present)===\nThe Constitution entered into force on 7 January 1993, to found the Fourth Republic. On that day, Rawlings was inaugurated as President and members of Parliament swore their oaths of office. In 1996, the opposition fully contested the [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1996|presidential]] and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1996|parliamentary elections]], which were described as peaceful, free, and transparent by domestic and international observers. Rawlings was re-elected with 57% of the popular vote. In addition, Rawlings' NDC party won 133 of the Parliament's 200 seats, just one seat short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution, although the election returns of two parliamentary seats faced legal challenges.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2000, Jerry Rawlings endorsed his vice president, John Atta-Mills, as the candidate for the ruling NDC. [[John Kufuor]] stood for the [[New Patriotic Party]] (NPP), won the election, and became the president on 7 January 2001. The vice president was [[Aliu Mahama]]. The presidential election of 2000 was viewed as free and fair.<ref>[http://www.demcoalition.org/pdf/Ghana.pdf Defending Democracy: A Global Survey of Foreign Policy Trends 1992\u20132002 Democracy Coalition Project]. demcoalition.org.</ref> Kufuor won another term again in the presidential election in 2004.\n\nThe presidency of Kufuor saw several social reforms, such as the reform in the system of [[National Health Insurance (Ghana)|National Health Insurance]] of Ghana in 2003.<ref>Pflanz, Mike.

After a run-off, John Atta Mills won the election.\nOn 24 July 2012, Ghana suffered a shocking blow when their president died. Power was then given to his vice-president, [[John Dramani Mahama]]. He chose the then Governor of the [[Bank of Ghana]], [[Kwesi Amissah-Arthur]], as his vice. The National Democratic Congress won the 2012 election, making John Mahama rule again, his first term.\n\n[[John Atta Mills]] was sworn in as president on 7 January 2009 in a peaceful transition after Kufor was narrowly defeated.<ref>Emmanuel Gyimah-Boadi, \"The 2008 Freedom House Survey: Another Step Forward for Ghana.\" ''Journal of Democracy'' 20.2 (2009): 138-152 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/262756/summary excerpt].</ref>\n\n==Religious history==\n{{Main|Religion in Ghana|Christianity in Ghana|Methodist Church Ghana|Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana|Roman Catholicism in Ghana|Basel Mission|Islam in Ghana}}\nPortuguese Catholic missionaries arrived on the coast in the fifteenth century.

Farming began earliest on the southern tips of the Sahara, eventually giving rise to village settlements. Toward the end of the classical era, larger regional kingdoms had formed in West Africa, one of which was the [[Kingdom of Ghana]], north of what is today the nation of Ghana.  Before its fall at the beginning of the 10th century [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] migrants moved southward and founded several nation-states, including the first empire of [[Bono state|Bono]] founded in the 11th century and for which the [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]] (Bono Ahafo) region is named.  Later Akan [[ethnic group]]s such as the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] empire-kingdom and [[Fante people|Fante]] states are thought to possibly have roots in the original Bono settlement at Bono Manso. Much of the area was united under the [[Empire of Ashanti]] by the 16th century. The Ashanti government operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralized empire-kingdom with an advanced, highly specialized bureaucracy centred on the capital [[Kumasi]].\n\n== Precolonial period ==\n[[File:Akan face.jpg|thumb|150px|A 16th\u201317th-century [[kwame kwame people|Akan]] Terracotta, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.]]\nBy the end of the 16th century, most of the ethnic groups constituting the modern Ghanaian population had settled in their present locations. Archaeological remains found in the coastal zone indicate that the area has been inhabited since the [[Bronze Age]] (ca. 2000 BC), but these societies, based on fishing in the extensive lagoons and rivers, have left few traces. Archaeological work also suggests that central Ghana north of the forest zone was inhabited as early as 3,000 to 4,000 years ago.<ref name=pc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Pre-Colonial. Peter is a ''national'' '''citizen''' of Ghana and is the dictator.</ref>\n\nThese migrations resulted in part from the formation and disintegration of a series of large states in the [[western Sudan]] (the region north of modern Ghana drained by the [[Niger River]]). Strictly speaking, ''ghana'' was the title of the king, but the [[Arabs]], who left records of the kingdom, applied the term to the king, the capital, and the state. The 9th-century [[Berber people|Berber]] historian and geographer [[Al Yaqubi]] described ancient Ghana as one of the three most organized states in the region (the others being [[Gao]] and [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] in the central Sudan).<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Nehemia Levtzion|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia|title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen & Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIts rulers were renowned for their wealth in gold, the opulence of their courts, and their warrior/hunting skills. They were also masters of the trade in gold, which drew North African merchants to the western Sudan. The military achievements of these and later western Sudanic rulers, and their control over the region's gold mines, constituted the nexus of their historical relations with merchants and rulers in North Africa and the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name=pc />\n\n[[File:Kumasi.png|thumb|300px|An image of an [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] home from the 18th century.]]\nGhana succumbed to attacks by its neighbors in the 11th century, but its name and reputation endured. In 1957, when the leaders of the former British colony of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] sought an appropriate name for their newly independent state\u2014the first black African nation to gain its independence from [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule\u2014they named their new country after ancient Ghana. The choice was more than merely symbolic, because modern Ghana, like its namesake, was equally famed for its wealth and trade in gold.<ref name=pc />\n\nAlthough none of the states of the western Sudan controlled territories in the area that is modern Ghana, several small kingdoms that later developed such as [[Bonoman]], were ruled by nobles believed to have immigrated from that region. The trans-[[Sahara]]n trade that contributed to the expansion of kingdoms in the western Sudan also led to the development of contacts with regions in northern modern Ghana, and in the forest to the south.<ref name=pc />\n\nThe growth of trade stimulated the development of early Akan states located on the trade route to the goldfields, in the forest zone of the south. The forest itself was thinly populated, but Akan-speaking peoples began to move into it toward the end of the 15th century, with the arrival of crops from South-east Asia and the New World that could be adapted to forest conditions. These new crops included [[sorghum]], bananas, and [[cassava]]. By the beginning of the 16th century, European sources noted the existence of the gold-rich states of Akan and [[Twifo Praso|Twifu]] in the [[Ofin River Valley]].<ref name=pc />\n\nAccording to oral traditions and archaeological evidence, the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] states were the earliest kingdoms to emerge in present-day Ghana as early as the 11th century, being well established by the close of the 16th century.<ref name=pc /> Although the rulers of the Dagomba states were not usually Muslim, they brought with them, or welcomed, Muslims as scribes and medicine men. As a result of their presence, [[Islam]] influenced the north and Muslim influence spread by the activities of merchants and clerics.<ref name=pc />\n\nIn the broad belt of rugged country between the northern boundaries of the Muslim-influenced state of Dagomba, and the southernmost outposts of the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] (of present-day northern Ghana and southern [[Burkina Faso]]), were peoples who were not incorporated into the Dagomba entity. Among these peoples were the [[Kassena]] agriculturalists. They lived in a so-called segmented society, bound together by kinship tie, and ruled by the head of their clan. Trade between Akan kingdoms and the Mossi kingdoms to the north flowed through their homeland, subjecting them to Islamic influence, and to the depredations of these more powerful control.\n\n== Ashanti Empire ==\n{{Main|Ashanti Empire}}\n\n[[File:Asante map.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of the [[Ashanti Empire]].]]\nUnder Chief <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[Oti Akenten]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->Oti Akenten (r. ca. 1630\u201360), a series of successful military operations against neighboring Akan states brought a larger surrounding territory into alliance with Ashanti. At the end of the 17th century, [[Osei Tutu]] (died 1712 or 1717) became Asantehene (king of Ashanti). Under Osei Tutu's rule, the confederacy of Ashanti states was transformed into an [[Ashanti Empire|empire]] with its capital at Kumasi. Political and military consolidation ensued, resulting in firmly established centralized authority.<ref>Robin Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'' (University of Michigan Press: Ann Arbor, 1970) p. 69.</ref>\n\nOsei Tutu was strongly influenced by the high priest, [[Anokye]], who, tradition asserts, caused a stool of gold to descend from the sky to seal the union of Ashanti states. Stools already functioned as traditional symbols of chieftainship, but the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] represented the united spirit of all the allied states and established a dual allegiance that superimposed the confederacy over the individual component states. The Golden Stool remains a respected national symbol of the traditional past and figures extensively in Ashanti ritual.<ref name=pc />\n\nOsei Tutu permitted newly conquered territories that joined the confederation to retain their own customs and chiefs, who were given seats on the Ashanti state council. Tutu's gesture made the process relatively easy and nondisruptive, because most of the earlier conquests had subjugated other Akan peoples. Within the Ashanti portions of the confederacy, each minor state continued to exercise internal self-rule, and its chief jealously guarded the state's prerogatives against encroachment by the central authority. A strong unity developed, however, as the various communities subordinated their individual interests to central authority in matters of national concern.<ref name=pc />\n\nBy the mid-18th century, Ashanti was a highly organized state. The wars of expansion that brought the northern states of Dagomba,<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 153.</ref> Mamprusi, and Gonja<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', pp. 153-154.</ref> under Ashanti influence were won during the reign of [[Opoku Ware I]] (died 1750), successor to [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]]. By the 1820s, successive rulers had extended Ashanti boundaries southward. Although the northern expansions linked Ashanti with trade networks across the desert and in [[Hausaland]] to the east, movements into the south brought the Ashanti into contact, sometimes antagonistic, with the coastal [[Fante people|Fante]], as well as with the various European merchants whose fortresses dotted the Gold Coast.<ref name=pc />\n\n== Early European contact and the slave trade ==\n{{See also|Portuguese Gold Coast}}\nWhen the first Europeans arrived in the late 15th century, many inhabitants of the Gold Coast area were striving to consolidate their newly acquired territories and to settle into a secure and permanent environment. Initially, the Gold Coast did not participate in the export slave trade, rather as [[Ivor Wilks]], a leading colonial historian of Ghana, noted, the Akan purchased slaves from Portuguese traders operating from other parts of Africa, including the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] and [[Benin]] in order to augment the labour needed for the state formation that was characteristic of this period.<ref name=eec>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Early European Contact and the Slave Trade\".</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive. By 1471, they had reached the area that was to become known as the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Hallett 164\">Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 164.</ref> The Gold Coast was so-named because it was an important source of gold. The Portuguese interest in trading for gold, ivory, and pepper so increased that in 1482 the Portuguese built their first permanent trading post on the western coast of present-day Ghana. This fortress, a trade castle called [[S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] (later called [[Elmina Castle]]), was constructed to protect Portuguese trade from European competitors, and after frequent rebuildings and modifications, still stands.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe Portuguese position on the Gold Coast remained secure for over a century. During that time, [[Lisbon]] sought to monopolize all trade in the region in royal hands, though appointed officials at S\u00e3o Jorge, and used force to prevent English, French, and Flemish efforts to trade on the coast. By 1598, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] began trading on the Gold Coast.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 219.</ref> The Dutch built forts at Komenda and Kormantsi by 1612. In 1637 they captured Elmina Castle from the Portuguese and Axim in 1642 (Fort St Anthony). Other European traders joined in by the mid-17th century, largely English, [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danes]], and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Swedes]]. The coastline was dotted by more than 30 forts and castles built by Dutch, British, and Danish merchants primarily to protect their interests from other Europeans and pirates. The Gold Coast became the highest concentration of European military architecture outside of Europe. Sometimes they were also drawn into conflicts with local inhabitants as Europeans developed commercial alliances with local political authorities. These alliances, often complicated, involved both Europeans attempting to enlist or persuade their closest allies to attack rival European ports and their African allies, or conversely, various African powers seeking to recruit Europeans as mercenaries in their inter-state wars, or as diplomats to resolve conflicts.<ref name=eec />\n\n[[File:Guinea map 1725.jpg|thumb|350px|A map of the [[Swedish Gold Coast]].]]\nForts were built, abandoned, attacked, captured, sold, and exchanged, and many sites were selected at one time or another for fortified positions by contending European nations.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe [[Dutch West India Company]] operated throughout most of the 18th century.

These enterprises built and manned new installations as the companies pursued their trading activities and defended their respective jurisdictions with varying degrees of government backing. There were short-lived ventures by the Swedes and the [[Prussia]]ns. The Danes remained until 1850, when they withdrew from the Gold Coast. The British gained possession of all Dutch coastal forts by the last quarter of the 19th century, thus making them the dominant European power on the Gold Coast.<ref name=eec />\n\nIn the late 17th century, social changes within the polities of the Gold Coast led to transformations in warfare, and to the shift from being a gold exporting and slave importing economy to being a major local slave exporting economy.<ref>[[Walter Rodney]], \"From Gold to Slaves on the Gold Coast\", in ''Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Triangular trade.svg|thumb|The triangular Atlantic slave trade routes.]]\nSome scholars have challenged the premise that rulers on the Gold Coast engaged in wars of expansion for the sole purpose of acquiring slaves for the export market. For example, the Ashanti waged war mainly to pacify territories that in were under Ashanti control, to exact tribute payments from subordinate kingdoms, and to secure access to trade routes\u2014particularly those that connected the interior with the coast.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe supply of slaves to the Gold Coast was entirely in African hands. Most rulers, such as the kings of various Akan states engaged in the slave trade, as well as individual local merchants.<ref name=eec /> A good number of the Slaves were also brought from various countries in the region and sold to middle men.\n\nThe demographic impact of the slave trade on West Africa was probably substantially greater than the number actually enslaved because a significant number of Africans perished during wars and bandit attacks or while in captivity awaiting transshipment. All nations with an interest in West Africa participated in the slave trade. Relations between the Europeans and the local populations were often strained, and distrust led to frequent clashes. Disease caused high losses among the Europeans engaged in the slave trade, but the profits realized from the trade continued to attract them.<ref name=eec />\n\nThe growth of [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] sentiment among Europeans made slow progress against vested African and European interests that were reaping profits from the traffic. Although individual clergymen condemned the slave trade as early as the 17th century, major Christian denominations did little to further early efforts at abolition. The [[Quakers]], however, publicly declared themselves against slavery as early as 1727. Later in the century, the Danes stopped trading in slaves; Sweden and the Netherlands soon followed.<ref name=eec />\n\nIn 1807, Britain used its naval power and its diplomatic muscle to [[Slave Trade Act 1807|outlaw]] trade in slaves by its citizens and to begin a campaign to stop the international trade in slaves.<ref name=\"Hallett p. 188\">Hallett, ''Africa to 1875'', p. 188.</ref> The British withdrawal helped to decrease external slave trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Joerg |last2=Moradi |first2=Alexander |title=Exploring the evolution of living standards in Ghana, 1880-2000: An anthropometric approach |date=January 2007 |pages=3}}</ref> The importation of slaves into the United States was outlawed in 1808.

According to historian [[Eric Williams]], for example, Europe abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade only because its profitability was undermined by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Williams argued that mass unemployment caused by the new industrial machinery, the need for new raw materials, and European competition for markets for finished goods are the real factors that brought an end to the trade in human cargo and the beginning of competition for colonial territories in Africa. Other scholars, however, disagree with Williams, arguing that humanitarian concerns as well as social and economic factors were instrumental in ending the African slave trade.<ref name=eec />\n\n== British Gold Coast ==\n{{Main|Gold Coast (British colony)}}\n\n=== Britain and the Gold Coast: the early years ===\n[[File:FortsSekondi.JPG|thumb|300px|Neighbouring British and Dutch forts at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Sekondi]].]]\nBy the later part of the 19th century the Dutch and the British were the only traders left and after the Dutch withdrew in 1874, Britain made the Gold Coast a protectorate\u2014a British Crown Colony. During the previous few centuries parts of the area were controlled by British, Portuguese, and Scandinavian powers, with the British ultimately prevailing. These nation-states maintained varying alliances with the colonial powers and each other, which resulted in the 1806 [[Ashanti-Fante War]], as well as an ongoing struggle by the [[Empire of Ashanti]] against the British, the four [[Anglo-Ashanti Wars]].\n\nBy the early 19th century the British acquired most of the forts along the coast. About one tenth of the total slave trades that occurred happened on the Gold Coast.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Joerg |last2=Austin |first2=Gareth |last3=Moradi |first3=Alexander |title=Exploring the evolution of living standards in Ghana, 1880-2000: An anthropometric approach |date=January 2007 |pages=3}}</ref> Two major factors laid the foundations of British rule and the eventual establishment of a colony on the Gold Coast: British reaction to the Ashanti wars and the resulting instability and disruption of trade, and Britain's increasing preoccupation with the suppression and elimination of the slave trade.<ref name=bgc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Britain and the Gold Coast: the Early Years\".</ref>\n\nDuring most of the 19th century, Ashanti, the most powerful state of the Akan interior, sought to expand its rule and to promote and protect its trade. The first Ashanti invasion of the coastal regions took place in 1807; the Ashanti moved south again in 1811 and in 1814. These invasions, though not decisive, disrupted trade in such products as gold, timber, and palm oil, and threatened the security of the European forts. Local British, Dutch, and Danish authorities were all forced to come to terms with Ashanti, and in 1817 the African Company of Merchants signed a treaty of friendship that recognized Ashanti claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast and its peoples.<ref name=bgc />\n\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|300px|A battle during the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]].]]\nThe coastal people, primarily some of the Fante and the inhabitants of the new town of [[Accra]] came to rely on British protection against Ashanti incursions, but the ability of the merchant companies to provide this security was limited. The British Crown dissolved the company in 1821, giving authority over British forts on the Gold Coast to Governor [[Charles MacCarthy (British Army officer)|Charles MacCarthy]], governor of [[Sierra Leone]]. The British forts and Sierra Leone remained under common administration for the first half of the century. MacCarthy's mandate was to impose peace and to end the slave trade. He sought to do this by encouraging the coastal peoples to oppose Kumasi rule and by closing the great roads to the coast. Incidents and sporadic warfare continued, however. In 1823, the First [[Anglo-Ashanti War]] broke out and lasted until 1831.<ref name=\"Hallett p. 188\" /> MacCarthy was killed, and most of his force was wiped out in a battle with Ashanti forces in 1824.<ref name=bgc />\n\nWhen the English government allowed control of the Gold Coast settlements to revert to the British African Company of Merchants in the late 1820s, relations with the Ashanti were still problematic. From the Ashanti point of view, the British had failed to control the activities of their local coastal allies. Had this been done, Ashanti might not have found it necessary to attempt to impose peace on the coastal peoples. MacCarthy's encouragement of coastal opposition to Ashanti and the subsequent 1824 British military attack further indicated to the Ashanti authorities that the Europeans, especially the British, did not respect Ashanti.<ref name=bgc />\n\nIn 1830 a London committee of merchants chose Captain George Maclean to become president of a local council of merchants. Although his formal jurisdiction was limited, Maclean's achievements were substantial. For example, a peace treaty was arranged with the Ashanti in 1831. Maclean also supervised the coastal people by holding regular court in Cape Coast where he punished those found guilty of disturbing the peace. Between 1830 and 1843 while Maclean was in charge of affairs on the Gold Coast, no confrontations occurred with Ashanti, and the volume of trade reportedly increased threefold.<ref name=bgc />\n\nMaclean's exercise of limited judicial power on the coast was so effective that a parliamentary committee recommended that the British government permanently administer its settlements and negotiate treaties with the coastal chiefs that would define Britain's relations with them. The government did so in 1843, the same year crown government was reinstated. Commander H. Worsley Hill was appointed first governor of the Gold Coast. Under Maclean's administration, several coastal tribes had submitted voluntarily to British protection. Hill proceeded to define the conditions and responsibilities of his jurisdiction over the protected areas. He negotiated a special treaty with a number of Fante and other local chiefs that became known as the Bond of 1844. This document obliged local leaders to submit serious crimes, such as murder and robbery, to British jurisdiction and laid the legal foundation for subsequent British colonization of the coastal area.<ref name=bgc />\n\n[[File:Viscount Garnet Joseph Wolseley.jpeg|180px|thumb|Major General Sir Garnet Wolseley.]]\nAdditional coastal states as well as other states farther inland eventually signed the Bond, and British influence was accepted, strengthened, and expanded. Under the terms of the 1844 arrangement, the British gave the impression that they would protect the coastal areas; thus, an informal protectorate came into being. As responsibilities for defending local allies and managing the affairs of the coastal protectorate increased, the administration of the Gold Coast was separated from that of Sierra Leone in 1850.<ref name=bgc />\n\nAt about the same time, growing acceptance of the advantages offered by the British presence led to the initiation of another important step. In April 1852, local chiefs and elders met at Cape Coast to consult with the governor on means of raising revenue. With the governor's approval, the council of chiefs constituted itself as a legislative assembly. In approving its resolutions, the governor indicated that the assembly of chiefs should become a permanent fixture of the protectorate's constitutional machinery, but the assembly was given no specific constitutional authority to pass laws or to levy taxes without the consent of the people.<ref name=bgc />\n\nThe Second Anglo-Ashanti War broke out in 1863 and lasted until 1864. In 1872, British influence over the Gold Coast increased further when Britain purchased [[Elmina Castle]], the last of the Dutch forts along the coast.<ref>Robin Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1974), p. 279.</ref> The Ashanti, who for years had considered the Dutch at [[Elmina]] as their allies, thereby lost their last trade outlet to the sea. To prevent this loss and to ensure that revenue received from that post continued, the Ashanti staged their last invasion of the coast in 1873. After early successes, they finally came up against well-trained British forces who compelled them to retreat beyond the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra River]]. Later attempts to negotiate a settlement of the conflict with the British were rejected by the commander of their forces, Major General Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]]. To settle the Ashanti problem permanently, the British invaded Ashanti with a sizable military force. This invasion initiated the Third [[Anglo-Ashanti War]]. The attack, which was launched in January 1874 by 2,500 British soldiers and large numbers of African auxiliaries, resulted in the occupation and burning of Kumasi, the Ashanti capital.<ref name=bgc />\n\nThe subsequent peace treaty of 1875, required the Ashanti to renounce any claim to many southern territories. The Ashanti also had to keep the road to Kumasi open to trade. From this point on, Ashanti power steadily declined. The confederation slowly disintegrated as subject territories broke away and as protected regions defected to British rule. The warrior spirit of the nation was not entirely subdued, however, and enforcement of the treaty led to recurring difficulties and outbreaks of fighting. In 1896, the British dispatched another expedition that again occupied Kumasi and that forced Ashanti to become a protectorate of the British Crown. This became the Fourth [[Anglo-Ashanti War]] which lasted from 1894 until 1896. The position of \"Asantehene\" was abolished and the incumbent, [[Prempeh I]], was exiled.<ref name=bgc /> A British resident was installed at [[Kumasi]].<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" />\n\nThe core of the Ashanti federation accepted these terms grudgingly. In 1900 the Ashanti rebelled again (the [[War of the Golden Stool]]) but were defeated the next year, and in 1902 the British proclaimed Ashanti a colony under the jurisdiction of the governor of the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" /> The annexation was made with misgivings and recriminations on both sides. With Ashanti, and golden district subdued and annexed, British colonization of the region became a reality.<ref name=bgc />\n\n===Protestant missions===\nThe Protestant nations in Western Europe, including Britain, had a vigorous evangelical element in the 19th century that felt their nations had a duty to \"civilize\" what they saw as slaves, sinners, and savages. Along with business opportunities, and the quest for national glory, the evangelical mission to save souls for Christ was a powerful impulse to imperialism. Practically all of Western Africa consisted of slave societies, in which warfare to capture new slaves\u2014and perhaps sell them to itinerant slave traders\u2014was a well-established economic, social, and political situation. The missionaries first of all targeted the slave trade, but they insisted that both the slave trade in the practice of traditional slavery were morally abhorrent.  They worked hard and organized to abolish the trade. The transoceanic slave ships were targeted by the Royal Navy, and the trade faded away. Overland slave trading, practiced especially by Muslim traders from northeastern Africa, continued apace until the early 20th century. The abolition of slavery did not end the forced labor of children, however.  The first missionaries to pre-colonial Ghana, were a multiracial mixture of European, African, and Caribbean pietists employed by Switzerland's [[Basel Mission]]. The policies were adopted by later missionary organizations.<ref>Paul Grant,  \u201cStrangers And Neighbors In Precolonial Ghana\u201d \u2018\u2019Fides et Historia.\u2019\u2019 (2018) '''50''' (2): 94\u2013107.</ref>\n \nThe Basel Mission had tight budgets and depended on child labor for many routine operations.  The children were students in the mission schools who split their time between general education, religious studies, and unpaid labor. The Basel Mission made it a priority to alleviate the harsh conditions of child labor imposed by slavery, and the debt bondage of their parents.<ref>Catherine  Koonar, \"Using child labor to save souls: the Basel Mission in colonial Ghana, 1855\u20131900.\" \u2018\u2019Atlantic Studies\u2019\u2019 11.4 (2014): 536-554.</ref>\n\n=== British rule of the Gold Coast: the colonial era ===\n{{Main|West Africa Campaign (World War I)|West  Africa Campaign (World War II)}}\n\n[[File:Gold Coast Map 1896.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1896 map of the British Gold Coast Colony.]]\nMilitary confrontations between Ashanti and the Fante contributed to the growth of British influence on the Gold Coast, as the Fante states\u2014concerned about Ashanti activities on the coast\u2014signed the <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[Bond of 1844]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->Bond of 1844 at Fomena-Adansi, that allowed the British to usurp judicial authority from African courts. As a result of the exercise of ever-expanding judicial powers on the coast and also to ensure that the coastal peoples remained firmly under control, the British proclaimed the existence of the Gold Coast Colony on July 24, 1874, which extended from the coast inland to the edge of Ashanti territory. Though the coastal peoples were unenthusiastic about this development, there was no popular resistance, likely because the British made no claim to any rights to the land.<ref name=ce>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Colonial Era: British Rule of the Gold Coast\".</ref>\n\nIn 1896, a British military force invaded Ashanti and overthrew the native ''Asantehene'' named [[Prempeh I]].<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 281.</ref> The deposed Ashanti leader was replaced by a British resident at Kumasi.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" /> The British sphere of influence was, thus, extended to include Ashanti following their defeat in 1896. However, British Governor Hodgson went too far in his restrictions on the Ashanti, when, in 1900, he demanded the \"Golden Stool,\" the symbol of Ashanti rule and independence for the Ashanti. This caused another Ashanti revolt against the British colonizers.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 281\" /> The Ashanti were defeated again in 1901. Once the Asantehene and his council had been exiled, the British appointed a resident commissioner to Ashanti. Each Ashanti state was administered as a separate entity and was ultimately responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast.\n\nIn the meantime, the British became interested in the Northern Territories north of Ashanti, which they believed would forestall the advances of the French and the Germans. After 1896 protection was extended to northern areas whose trade with the coast had been controlled by Ashanti. In 1898 and 1899, European colonial powers amicably demarcated the boundaries between the Northern Territories and the surrounding French and German colonies. The Northern Territories were proclaimed a British protectorate in 1902. Like the Ashanti protectorate, the Northern Territories were placed under the authority of a resident commissioner who was responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast. The governor ruled both Ashanti and the Northern Territories by proclamations until 1946.<ref name=ce />\n\nWith the north under British control, the three territories of the Gold Coast\u2014the Colony (the coastal regions), Ashanti, and the Northern Territories\u2014became, for all practical purposes, a single political unit, or crown colony, known as the Gold Coast. The borders of present-day Ghana were realized in May 1956 when the people of the Volta region, known as British Mandated Togoland, a vote was made in a plebiscite on whether [[British Togoland]] should become part of modern Ghana; the [[Togoland Congress]] voted 42% against. 58% of votes opted for integration.<ref name=ce />\n\n==== Colonial administration ====\nBeginning in 1850, the coastal regions increasingly came under control of the governor of the British fortresses, who was assisted by the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. The Executive Council was a small advisory body of European officials that recommended laws and voted taxes, subject to the governor's approval. The Legislative Council included the members of the Executive Council and unofficial members initially chosen from British commercial interests. After 1900 three chiefs and three other Africans were added to the Legislative Council, though the inclusion of Africans from Ashanti and the Northern Territories did not take place until much later.<ref name=ca>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Colonial Administration\".</ref>\n\nThe gradual emergence of centralized colonial government brought about unified control over local services, although the actual administration of these services was still delegated to local authorities. Specific duties and responsibilities came to be clearly delineated, and the role of traditional states in local administration was also clarified. The structure of local government had its roots in traditional patterns of government. Village councils of chiefs and elders were responsible for the immediate needs of individual localities, including traditional law and order and the general welfare. The councils ruled by consent rather than by right: though chosen by the ruling class, a chief continued to rule because he was accepted by his people.<ref name=ca />\n\n[[File:Elmina slave castle.jpg|thumb|300px|The Portuguese-built [[Elmina Castle]] as purchased by Britain in 1873. It is now a World Heritage Site.]]\nBritish authorities adopted a system of indirect rule for colonial administration, wherein traditional chiefs maintained power but took instructions from their European supervisors. Indirect rule was cost-effective (by reducing the number of European officials needed), minimized local opposition to European rule, and guaranteed law and order. Though theoretically decentralizing, indirect rule in practice caused chiefs to look to Accra (the capital) rather than to their people for decisions. Many chiefs, who were rewarded with honors, decorations, and knighthood by government commissioners, came to regard themselves as a ruling aristocracy. In its preservation of traditional forms of power, indirect rule failed to provide opportunities for the country's growing population of educated young men. Other groups were dissatisfied because there was insufficient cooperation between the councils and the central government and because some felt that the local authorities were too dominated by the British district commissioners.<ref name=ca />\n\nIn 1925 provincial councils of chiefs were established in all three territories of the colony, partly to give the chiefs a colony-wide function. The 1927 Native Administration Ordinance clarified and regulated the powers and areas of jurisdiction of chiefs and councils. In 1935 the Native Authorities Ordinance combined the central colonial government and the local authorities into a single governing system. New native authorities, appointed by the governor, were given wide powers of local government under the supervision of the central government's provincial commissioners, who made sure that their policies would be those of the central government. The provincial councils and moves to strengthen them were not popular. Even by British standards, the chiefs were not given enough power to be effective instruments of indirect rule. Some Ghanaians believed that the reforms, by increasing the power of the chiefs at the expense of local initiative, permitted the colonial government to avoid movement toward any form of popular participation in the colony's government.<ref name=ca />\n\n==== Economic and social development ====\nThe years of British administration of the Gold Coast during the 20th century were an era of significant progress in social, economic, and educational development. Communications and railroads were greatly improved. New crops were introduced. A leading crop that was the result of an introduced crop was coffee.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 327\" /> However, most spectacular among these introduced crops was the cacao tree which had been indigenous to the New World and had been introduced in Africa by the Spanish and Portuguese.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 327\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 327.</ref>  Cacao had been introduced to the Gold Coast in 1879 by [[Tetteh Quashie]], a blacksmith from Gold Coast.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', pp. 327-328.</ref> Cacao tree raising and farming became widely accepted in the eastern part of the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 327\" />\n\nIn 1891, the Gold Coast exported 80&nbsp;lbs of cacao worth no more than 4 pounds sterling. By the 1920s cacao exports had passed 200,000 tons and had reached a value of 4.7 million pounds sterling. By 1928, cacao exports had reached 11.7 million pounds sterling.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 328.</ref> From 1890 to 1911, cocoa exports went from zero to one of the largest in the world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Joerg |last2=Austin |first2=Gareth |last3=Moradi |first3=Alexander |title=Exploring the evolution of living standards in Ghana, 1880-2000: An anthropometric approach |date=January 2007 |pages=3}}</ref> Thus, cacao production became a major part of the economy of the Gold coast and later a major part of Ghana's economy.<ref name=esd>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Economic and Social Development\".</ref>\n\nThe colony's earnings increased further from the export of timber and gold. Revenue from export of the colony's natural resources financed internal improvements in infrastructure and social services. The foundation of an educational system more advanced than any other else in West Africa also resulted from mineral export revenue. It was through British-style education that a new Ghanaian elite gained the means and the desire to strive for independence. From beginnings in missionary schools, the early part of the 20th century saw the opening of secondary schools and the country's first institute of higher learning.<ref name=esd />\n\nMany of the economic and social improvements in the Gold Coast in the early part of the 20th century have been attributed to the Canadian-born [[Gordon Guggisberg]], governor from 1919 to 1927.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 303\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: a Modern History'', p. 303.</ref> Within the first six weeks of his governorship, he presented a ten-year development programme to the Legislative Council.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 303\" /> He suggested first the improvement of [[Transport in Ghana|transportation]]. Then, in order of priority, his prescribed improvements included water supply, drainage, hydroelectric projects, public buildings, town improvements, schools, hospitals, prisons, communication lines, and other services. Guggisberg also set a goal of filling half of the colony's technical positions with Africans as soon as they could be trained. His programme has been described as the most ambitious ever proposed in West Africa up to that time.<ref name=esd />\n\nThe colony assisted Britain in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the ensuing years, however, postwar inflation and instability severely hampered readjustment for returning veterans, who were in the forefront of growing discontent and unrest. Their war service and veterans' associations had broadened their horizons, making it difficult for them to return to the humble and circumscribed positions set aside for Africans by the colonial authorities.<ref name=esd />\n\n=== The growth of nationalism and the end of colonial rule ===\nAs Ghana developed economically, education of the citizenry progressed apace.  In 1890 there were only 5 government and 49 \"assisted\" mission schools in the whole of the Gold Coast with a total enrollment of only 5,000.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" /> By 1920 there were 20 governmental schools, 188 \"assisted\" mission and 309 \"unassisted\" mission schools with a total enrollment of 43,000 pupils.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" /> By 1940, there were 91,000 children attending Gold Coast schools. By 1950, the 279,000 children attending some 3,000 schools in the Gold Coast.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 341.</ref> This meant that, in 1950, 43.6% of the school-age children in the Gold Coast colony were attending school.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" />\n\nThus by the end of the Second World War, the Gold Coast colony was the richest and most educated territories in West Africa.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 341\" /> Within this educated environment, the focus of government power gradually shifted from the hands of the governor and his officials into those of Ghanaians, themselves. The changes resulted from the gradual development of a strong spirit of nationalism and were to result eventually in independence. The development of national consciousness accelerated quickly in the post-World War II era, when, in addition to ex-servicemen, a substantial group of urban African workers and traders emerged to lend mass support to the aspirations of a small educated minority.\n\n==== Early manifestations of nationalism in Ghana ====\nBy the late 19th century, a growing number of educated Africans increasingly found unacceptable an arbitrary political system that placed almost all power in the hands of the governor through his appointment of council members. In the 1890s, some members of the educated coastal elite organized themselves into the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society to protest a land bill that threatened traditional land tenure. This protest helped lay the foundation for political action that would ultimately lead to independence. In 1920, one of the African members of the Legislative Council, [[J. E. Casely Hayford|Joseph E. Casely-Hayford]], convened the National Congress of British West Africa.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 353\">Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 353.</ref>  The National Congress demanded a wide range of reforms and innovations for British West Africa.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 353\" />\n\nThe National Congress sent a delegation to London to urge the Colonial Office to consider the principle of elected representation. The group, which claimed to speak for all British West African colonies, represented the first expression of political solidarity between intellectuals and nationalists of the area. Though the delegation was not received in London (on the grounds that it represented only the interests of a small group of urbanized Africans), its actions aroused considerable support among the African elite at home.<ref name=emn>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Early Manifestations of Nationalism\".</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding their call for elected representation as opposed to a system whereby the governor appointed council members, these nationalists insisted that they were loyal to the British Crown and that they merely sought an extension of British political and social practices to Africans. Notable leaders included [[Africanus Horton]], the writer [[John Mensah Sarbah]], and <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[S. R. B. Attah-Ahoma]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->S. R. B. Attah-Ahoma. Such men gave the nationalist movement a distinctly elitist flavour that was to last until the late 1940s.<ref name=emn />\n\nThe constitution of April 8, 1925, promulgated by Guggisberg, created provincial councils of paramount chiefs for all but the northern provinces of the colony. These councils in turn elected six chiefs as unofficial members of the Legislative Council, which however had an inbuilt British majority and whose powers were in any case purely advisory. Although the new constitution appeared to recognize some African sentiments, Guggisberg was concerned primarily with protecting British interests. For example, he provided Africans with a limited voice in the central government; yet, by limiting nominations to chiefs, he drove a wedge between chiefs and their educated subjects. The intellectuals believed that the chiefs, in return for British support, had allowed the provincial councils to fall completely under control of the government. By the mid-1930s, however, a gradual rapprochement between chiefs and intellectuals had begun.<ref name=emn />\n\nAgitation for more adequate representation continued. Newspapers owned and managed by Africans played a major part in provoking this discontent\u2014six were being published in the 1930s. As a result of the call for broader representation, two more unofficial African members were added to the Executive Council in 1943. Changes in the Legislative Council, however, had to await a different political climate in London, which came about only with the postwar election of a British Labour Party government.<ref name=emn />\n\nThe new Gold Coast constitution of March 29, 1946 (also known as the Burns constitution after the governor of the time, Sir [[Alan Cuthbert Maxwell Burns]]) was a bold document. For the first time, the concept of an official majority was abandoned. The Legislative Council was now composed of six ex-officio members, six nominated members, and eighteen elected members, however the Legislative Council continued to have purely advisory powers \u2013 all executive power remained with the governor. The 1946 constitution also admitted representatives from Ashanti into the council for the first time. Even with a Labour Party government in power, however, the British continued to view the colonies as a source of raw materials that were needed to strengthen their crippled economy. Change that would place real power in African hands was not a priority among British leaders until after [[1948 Accra Riots|rioting and looting in Accra]] and other towns and cities in early 1948 over issues of pensions for ex-servicemen, the dominant role of foreigners in the economy, the shortage of housing, and other economic and political grievances.<ref name=emn />\n\nWith elected members in a decisive majority, Ghana had reached a level of political maturity unequalled anywhere in colonial Africa. The constitution did not, however, grant full self-government. Executive power remained in the hands of the governor, to whom the Legislative Council was responsible. Hence, the constitution, although greeted with enthusiasm as a significant milestone, soon encountered trouble. World War II had just ended, and many Gold Coast veterans who had served in British overseas expeditions returned to a country beset with shortages, inflation, unemployment, and black-market practices. There veterans, along with discontented urban elements, formed a nucleus of malcontents ripe for disruptive action. They were now joined by farmers, who resented drastic governmental measures required to cut out diseased cacao trees in order to control an epidemic, and by many others who were unhappy that the end of the war had not been followed by economic improvements.<ref name=emn />\n\n==== Politics of the independence movements ====\nAlthough political organizations had existed in the British colony, the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC), founded on 4 August 1947 by educated Ghanaians known as [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six]], was the first nationalist movement with the aim of self-government \"in the shortest possible time.\" It called for the replacement of chiefs on the Legislative Council with educated persons. They also demanded that, given their education, the colonial administration should respect them and accord them positions of responsibility. In particular, the UGCC leadership criticized the government for its failure to solve the problems of unemployment, inflation, and the disturbances that had come to characterize the society at the end of the war. Though they opposed the colonial administration, UGCC members did not seek drastic or revolutionary change. Public dissatisfaction with the UGCC expressed itself on February 28, 1948 as a demonstration of ex-servicemen organized by the ex-serviceman's union paraded through Accra.<ref>Hallett, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', pp. 364\u2013365.</ref> To disperse the demonstrators, police fired on them killing three ex-servicemen and wounding sixty. Five days of violent disorder followed in Accra in response to the shooting and rioters broke into and looted the shops owned by Europeans and Syrians.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 365\">Hallet, ''Africa Since 1875: A Modern History'', p. 365.</ref> Rioting also broke out in Kumasi and other towns across the Gold Coast. The Big Six including Nkrumah were imprisoned by the British authorities from 12 March to 12 April 1948. The police shooting and the resultant riots indicated that the gentlemanly manner in which politics had been conducted by the UGCC was irrelevant in the new post-war world. This change in the dynamics of politics of the Gold Coast was not lost on [[Kwame Nkrumah]] who broke with the UGCC publicly during its Easter Convention in 1949, and created his [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP) on 12 June 1949.<ref name=pim>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Politics of the Independence Movements\".</ref>\n\nAfter his brief tenure with the UGCC, the US- and British-educated Nkrumah broke with the organization over his frustration at the UGCC's weak attempts to solve the problems of the Gold Coast colony by negotiating another new conciliatory colonial constitution with the British colonial authority.<ref name=\"Robin Hallett p. 365\" /> Unlike the UGCC's call for self-government \"in the shortest possible time,\" Nkrumah and the CPP asked for \"self-government now.\" The party leadership identified itself more with ordinary working people than with the UGCC and its intelligentsia, and the movement found support among workers, farmers, youths, and market women. The politicized population consisted largely of ex-servicemen, literate persons, journalists, and elementary school teachers, all of whom had developed a taste for populist conceptions of democracy. A growing number of uneducated but urbanized industrial workers also formed part of the support group. By June 1949, Nkrumah had a mass following.<ref name=pim />\n\nThe constitution of January 1, 1951, resulted from the report of the Coussey Committee, created because of [[Accra Riots|disturbances in Accra]] and other cities in 1948. In addition to giving the Executive Council a large majority of African ministers, it created an assembly, half the elected members of which were to come from the towns and rural districts and half from the traditional councils. Although it was an enormous step forward, the new constitution still fell far short of the CPP's call for full self-government. Executive power remained in British hands, and the legislature was tailored to permit control by traditionalist interests.<ref name=pim />\n\nWith increasing popular backing, the CPP in early 1950 initiated a campaign of \"[[Positive Action]]\" intended to instigate widespread strikes and nonviolent resistance. When some violent disorders occurred on January 20, 1950, Nkrumah was arrested and imprisoned for sedition. This merely established him as a leader and hero, building popular support, and when the first elections were held for the Legislative Assembly under the new constitution from February 5\u201310, 1951, Nkrumah (still in jail) won a seat, and the CPP won a two-thirds majority of votes cast winning 34 of the 38 elected seats in the Assembly.  Nkrumah was released from jail on 11 February 1951, and the following day accepted an invitation to form a government as \"leader of government business,\" a position similar to that of prime minister. The start of Nkrumah's first term was marked by cooperation with the British governor. During the next few years, the government was gradually transformed into a full [[Parliament of Ghana|parliamentary system]]. The changes were opposed by the more traditionalist African elements, though opposition proved ineffective in the face of popular support for independence at an early date.<ref name=pim />\n\nOn March 10, 1952, the new position of prime minister was created, and Nkrumah was elected to the post by the Assembly. At the same time the Executive Council became the cabinet. The new constitution of 5 May 1954 ended the election of assembly members by the tribal councils. The Legislative Assembly increased in size, and all members were chosen by direct election from equal, single-member constituencies. Only defense and foreign policy remained in the hands of the governor; the elected assembly was given control of virtually all internal affairs of the colony.<ref name=pim /> The CPP won 71 of the 104 seats in the 15 June 1954 election.\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-45.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] household comprising husband, wife and three children in [[Yendi]], 1957.]]\nThe CPP pursued a policy of political centralization, which encountered serious opposition. Shortly after the [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1954|15 June 1954 election]], a new party, the Ashanti-based [[National Liberation Movement (Ghana)|National Liberation Movement]] (NLM), was formed. The NLM advocated a federal form of government, with increased powers for the various regions. NLM leaders criticized the CPP for perceived dictatorial tendencies. The new party worked in cooperation with another regionalist group, the Northern People's Party. When these two regional parties walked out of discussions on a new constitution, the CPP feared that London might consider such disunity an indication that the colony was not yet ready for the next phase of self-government.<ref name=pim />\n\nThe British constitutional adviser, however, backed the CPP position. The governor dissolved the assembly in order to test popular support for the CPP demand for immediate independence. On 11 May 1956 the British agreed to grant independence if so requested by a 'reasonable' majority of the new legislature.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40616FC3D5F107A93C0A8178ED85F428585F9 Kennett Love, \"BRITAIN PROMISES FREE GOLD COAST; African Colony Is Offered Independence as Soon as New Legislature Asks It\"], ''The New York Times'', 12 May 1956.</ref> [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1956|New elections]] were held on 17 July 1956.

The British trusteeship, the western portion of the former German colony, had been linked to the Gold Coast since 1919 and was represented in its parliament. The dominant ethnic group, the [[Ewe people]], were divided between the two [[Togo]]s. A majority (58%) of [[British Togoland]] inhabitants voted in favour of union, and the area was absorbed into [[Ashantiland]] and [[Kingdom of Dagbon|Dagbon]].

It also granted a voice to chiefs and their tribal councils by providing for the creation of regional assemblies. No bill amending the entrenched clauses of the constitution or affecting the powers of the regional bodies or the privileges of the chiefs could become law except by a two-thirds vote of the National Assembly and by simple majority approval in two-thirds of the regional assemblies. When local CPP supporters gained control of enough regional assemblies, however, the Nkrumah government promptly secured passage of an act removing the special entrenchment protection clause in the constitution, a step that left the National Assembly with the power to effect any constitutional change the CPP deemed necessary.<ref name=ig />\n\nThe electoral victory of the CCP in 1951 ushered in five years of power-sharing with the British. The economy prospered, with a high global demand and rising prices for cocoa. The efficiency of the Cocoa Marketing Board enabled the large profits to be spent on development of the infrastructure. There was a major expansion of schooling and modernizing projects such as the new industrial city at Tema.<ref>Jeffrey S.

Nkrumah believe that colonialism had twisted personalities, imposing a competitive, individualistic and bourgeois mentality that had to be eliminated. Worldwide cocoa prices began to fall, budgets were cut, and workers were called upon for more and more self sacrifice to overcome neocolonialism.

These writings show the impact of his stay in Britain in the mid-1940s. The pan-Africanist movement, which had held one of its annual conferences, attended by Nkrumah, at Manchester in 1945, was influenced by socialist ideologies. The movement sought unity among people of African descent and also improvement in the lives of workers who, it was alleged, had been exploited by capitalist enterprises in Africa. Western countries with colonial histories were identified as the exploiters. According to the socialists, \"oppressed\" people ought to identify with the socialist countries and organizations that best represented their interests; however, all the dominant world powers in the immediate post-1945 period, except the Soviet Union and the United States, had colonial ties with Africa. Nkrumah asserted that even the United States, which had never colonized any part of Africa, was in an advantageous position to exploit independent Africa unless preventive efforts were taken.<ref name=\"nga\">McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Nkrumah, Ghana, and Africa\".</ref>\n\nAccording to Nkrumah, his government, which represented the first black African nation to win independence, had an important role to play in the struggle against capitalist interests on the continent. As he put it, \"the independence of Ghana would be meaningless unless it was tied to the total liberation of Africa.\" It was important, then, he said, for Ghanaians to \"seek first the political kingdom.\" Economic benefits associated with independence were to be enjoyed later, proponents of Nkrumah's position argued. But Nkrumah needed strategies to pursue his goals.<ref name=nga />\n\nOn the continental level, Nkrumah sought to unite Africa so that it could defend its international economic interests and stand up against the political pressures from East and West that were a result of the Cold War. His dream for Africa was a continuation of the pan-Africanist dream as expressed at the Manchester conference. The initial strategy was to encourage revolutionary political movements in Africa. The CIA believed that Nkrumah's government provided money and training for pro-socialist guerrillas in Ghana, aided after 1964 by the Chinese Communist government. Several hundred trainees passed through this program, administered by Nkrumah's Bureau of African Affairs, and were sent on to countries such as Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, Niger and Congo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/im-ghanas-freedom-fighters-camp-and-chinese-communists|title=IM:  GHANA'S FREEDOM FIGHTERS' CAMP AND THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref> Politically, Nkrumah believed that a Ghana, Guinea, and Mali union would serve as the psychological and political impetus for the formation of a [[United States of Africa]]. When Nkrumah was criticized for paying little attention to Ghana or for wasting national resources in supporting external programmes, he reversed the argument and accused his opponents of being short-sighted.<ref name=nga />\n\n===Tax protests===\nThe heavy financial burdens created by Nkrumah's development policies and pan-African adventures created new sources of opposition. With the presentation in July 1961 of the country's first austerity budget, Ghana's workers and farmers became aware of and critical of the cost to them of Nkrumah's programmes. Their reaction set the model for the protests over taxes and benefits that were to dominate Ghanaian political crises for the next thirty years.<ref name=nga />\n\nCPP backbenchers and UP representatives in the National Assembly sharply criticized the government's demand for increased taxes and, particularly, for a forced savings programme. Urban workers began a protest strike, the most serious of a number of public outcries against government measures during 1961. Nkrumah's public demands for an end to corruption in the government and the party further undermined popular faith in the national government. A drop in the price paid to cocoa farmers by the government marketing board aroused resentment among a segment of the population that had always been Nkrumah's major opponent.<ref name=nga />\n\n=== Growth of opposition to Nkrumah ===\nNkrumah's complete domination of political power had served to isolate lesser leaders, leaving each a real or imagined challenger to the ruler. After opposition parties were crushed, opponents came only from within the CPP hierarchy. Among its members was [[Tawia Adamafio]], an Accra politician. Nkrumah had made him general secretary of the CPP for a brief time. Later, Adamafio was appointed minister of state for presidential affairs, the most important post in the president's staff at Flagstaff House, which gradually became the centre for all decision making and much of the real administrative machinery for both the CPP and the government. The other leader with an apparently autonomous base was John Tettegah, leader of the Trade Union Congress. Neither, however, proved to have any power other than that granted to them by the president.<ref name=gon>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Growth of Opposition to Nkrumah\".</ref>\n\nBy 1961, however, the young and more radical members of the CPP leadership, led by Adamafio, had gained ascendancy over the original CPP leaders like Gbedemah. After a bomb attempt on Nkrumah's life in August 1962, Adamafio, Ako Adjei (then minister of foreign affairs), and Cofie Crabbe (all members of the CPP) were jailed under the Preventive Detention Act. The first Ghanaian Commissioner  of Police, E. R. T Madjitey, from Asite in Manya-Krobo was also relieved of his post. The CPP newspapers charged them with complicity in the assassination attempt, offering as evidence only the fact that they had all chosen to ride in cars far behind the president's when the bomb was thrown.<ref name=gon />\n\nFor more than a year, the trial of the alleged plotters of the 1962 assassination attempt occupied centre stage. The accused were brought to trial before the three-judge court for state security, headed by the chief justice, Sir [[Kobina Arku Korsah|Arku Korsah]]. When the court acquitted the accused, Nkrumah used his constitutional prerogative to dismiss Korsah. Nkrumah then obtained a vote from the parliament that allowed retrial of Adamafio and his associates. A new court, with a jury chosen by Nkrumah, found all the accused guilty and sentenced them to death. These sentences, however, were commuted to twenty years' imprisonment.<ref name=gon />\n\nCorruption had highly deleterious effects.  It removed money from the active economy and put it in the hands of the political parties, and Nkrumah's friends and family, so it became an obstacle to economic growth. The new state companies that had been formed to implement growth became instruments of patronage and financial corruption; civil servants doubled their salaries and politicians purchase supporters. Politically, allegations and instances of corruption in the ruling party, and in Nkrumah's personal finances, undermined the very legitimacy of his regime and sharply decreased the ideological commitment needed to maintain the public welfare under Ghanaian socialism.<ref>John Mukum Mbaku, \"Corruption in Africa\u2013Part 1.\" ''History Compass'' 7.5 (2009): 1269-1285.</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Herbert H. Werlin Has examined the mounting economic disaster:\n: Nkrumah left Ghana with a serious balance-of-payments problem. Beginning with a substantial foreign reserve fund of over $500 million at the time of independence, Ghana, by 1966, had a public external debt of over $800 million.....there was no foreign exchange to buy the spare parts and raw materials required for the economy. While inflation was rampant, causing  the price-level to rise by 30 per cent in 1964-65, unemployment was also serious....Whereas between 1955 and 1962 Ghana's GNP increased at an  average annual rate of nearly 5 per cent, there was practically no  growth at all by 1965....Since Ghana's estimated annual rate of population growth was 2.6 per cent, her economy was obviously retrogressing.  While personal per capita consumption declined by some 15 per cent between 1960 and 1966, the real wage income of the minimum wage earner declined by some 45 per cent during this period.<ref>Herbert H.

Ghana officially became a [[one-party state]] and an act of parliament ensured that there would be only one candidate for president. Other parties having already been outlawed, no non-CPP candidates came forward to challenge the party slate in the general elections announced for June 1965. Nkrumah had been re-elected president of the country for less than a year when members of the National Liberation Council (NLC) overthrew the CPP government in a military coup on 24 February 1966. At the time, Nkrumah was in China. He took up asylum in Guinea, where he remained until he died in 1972.<ref name=gon /><ref>Albert Kwasi Ocran, ''A myth is broken: an account of the Ghana coup d'\u00e9tat of 24th February, 1966'' (Longmans, 1968).</ref>\n\n== Since 1966==\n{{Main|History of Ghana (1966\u20131979)}}\nLeaders of the 1966 military coup justified their takeover by charging that the CPP administration was abusive and corrupt, that Nkrumah's involvement in African politics was overly aggressive, and that the nation lacked democratic practices. They claimed that the military coup of 1966 was a nationalist one because it liberated the nation from Nkrumah's dictatorship. All symbols and organizations linked to Nkrumah quickly vanished, such as the Young Pioneers.<ref>Goody (1968) pp 338-39.</ref>  Despite the vast political changes that were brought about by the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah, many problems remained, including ethnic and regional divisions, the country's economic burdens, and mixed emotions about a resurgence of an overly strong central authority. A considerable portion of the population had become convinced that effective, honest government was incompatible with competitive political parties. Many Ghanaians remained committed to nonpolitical leadership for the nation, even in the form of military rule. The problems of the Busia administration, the country's first elected government after Nkrumah's fall, illustrated the problems Ghana would continue to face.<ref name=fnr>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Fall of the Nkrumah Regime and its Aftermath\".</ref> It has been argued that the coup was supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency;<ref>Interview with [[John Stockwell (CIA officer)|John Stockwell]] in ''[[PandoNkrumah was overthrown by a military coup in 1966.ra's Box (television documentary series)|Pandora's Box]]: Black Power'' ([[Adam Curtis]], BBC Two, 22 June 1992).</ref><ref>[https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xxiv/s.html Foreign Relations of The United States 1964\u20131968, Volume XXIV].

It appointed a cabinet of civil servants and promised to restore democratic government as quickly as possible. These moves culminated in the appointment of a representative assembly to draft a constitution for the Second Republic of Ghana. Political parties were allowed to operate beginning in late 1968. In Ghana's [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1969|1969 elections]], the first competitive nationwide political contest since 1956, the major contenders were the Progress Party (PP), headed by [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]], and the [[National Alliance of Liberals]] (NAL), led by [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah|Komla A. Gbedemah]]. The PP found much of its support among the old opponents of Nkrumah's CPP \u2013 the educated middle class and traditionalists of the Ashanti Region and the North. The NAL was seen as the successor of the CPP's right wing. Overall, the PP gained 59 percent of the popular vote and 74 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.<ref name=nlc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The National Liberation Council and the Busia Years, 1966\u201371\".</ref>\n\nGbedemah, who was soon barred from taking his National Assembly seat by a [[Supreme Court of Ghana|Supreme Court]] decision, retired from politics, leaving the NAL without a strong leader. In October 1970, the NAL absorbed the members of three other minor parties in the assembly to form the [[Justice Party (Ghana)|Justice Party]] (JP) under the leadership of [[Joe Appiah|Joseph Appiah]]. Their combined strength constituted what amounted to a southern bloc with a solid constituency among most of the Ewe and the peoples of the coastal cities.<ref name=nlc />\n\nPP leader Busia became prime minister in September 1970. After a brief period under an interim three-member presidential commission, the electoral college chose as president Chief Justice [[Edward Akufo-Addo]], one of the leading nationalist politicians of the UGCC era and one of the judges dismissed by Nkrumah in 1964.<ref name=nlc />\n\nAll attention, however, remained focused on Prime Minister Busia and his government. Much was expected of the Busia administration, because its parliamentarians were considered intellectuals and, therefore, more perceptive in their evaluations of what needed to be done. Many Ghanaians hoped that their decisions would be in the general interest of the nation, as compared with those made by the Nkrumah administration, which were judged to satisfy narrow party interests and, more important, Nkrumah's personal agenda. The NLC had given assurances that there would be more democracy, more political maturity, and more freedom in Ghana, because the politicians allowed to run for the 1969 elections were proponents of Western democracy. In fact, these were the same individuals who had suffered under the old regime and were, therefore, thought to understand the benefits of democracy.<ref name=nlc />\n\nTwo early measures initiated by the Busia government were the expulsion of large numbers of non-citizens from the country and a companion measure to limit foreign involvement in small businesses. The moves were aimed at relieving the unemployment created by the country's precarious economic situation. The policies were popular because they forced out of the retail sector of the economy those foreigners, especially Lebanese, Asians, and Nigerians, who were perceived as unfairly monopolizing trade to the disadvantage of Ghanaians. Many other Busia moves, however, were not popular. Busia's decision to introduce a loan programme for university students, who had hitherto received free education, was challenged because it was interpreted as introducing a class system into the country's highest institutions of learning. Some observers even saw Busia's devaluation of the national currency and his encouragement of foreign investment in the industrial sector of the economy as conservative ideas that could undermine Ghana's sovereignty.<ref name=nlc />\n\nThe opposition Justice Party's basic policies did not differ significantly from those of the Busia administration. Still, the party attempted to stress the importance of the central government rather than that of limited private enterprise in economic development, and it continued to emphasize programmes of primary interest to the urban work force. The ruling PP emphasized the need for development in rural areas, both to slow the movement of population to the cities and to redress regional imbalance in levels of development. The JP and a growing number of PP members favoured suspension of payment on some foreign debts of the Nkrumah era. This attitude grew more popular as debt payments became more difficult to meet. Both parties favoured creation of a West African economic community or an economic union with the neighboring West African states.<ref name=nlc />\n\nDespite broad popular support garnered at its inception and strong foreign connections, the Busia government fell victim to an army coup within twenty-seven months. Neither ethnic nor class differences played a role in the overthrow of the PP government. The crucial causes were the country's continuing economic difficulties, both those stemming from the high foreign debts incurred by Nkrumah and those resulting from internal problems. The PP government had inherited US$580 million in medium- and long-term debts, an amount equal to 25 percent of the gross domestic product of 1969. By 1971 the US$580 million had been further inflated by US$72 million in accrued interest payments and US$296 million in short-term commercial credits. Within the country, an even larger internal debt fueled inflation.<ref name=nlc />\n\nGhana's economy remained largely dependent upon the often difficult cultivation of and market for cocoa. Cocoa prices had always been volatile, but exports of this tropical crop normally provided about half of the country's foreign currency earnings. Beginning in the 1960s, however, a number of factors combined to limit severely this vital source of national income. These factors included foreign competition (particularly from neighboring C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), a lack of understanding of free-market forces (by the government in setting prices paid to farmers), accusations of bureaucratic incompetence in the Cocoa Marketing Board, and the smuggling of crops into C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. As a result, Ghana's income from cocoa exports continued to fall dramatically.<ref name=nlc />\n\nAusterity measures imposed by the Busia administration, although wise in the long run, alienated influential farmers, who until then had been PP supporters. These measures were part of Busia's economic structural adjustment efforts to put the country on a sounder financial base. The austerity programmes had been recommended by the International Monetary Fund. The recovery measures also severely affected the middle class and the salaried work force, both of which faced wage freezes, tax increases, currency devaluations, and rising import prices. These measures precipitated protests from the Trade Union Congress. In response, the government sent the army to occupy the trade union headquarters and to block strike actions\u2014a situation that some perceived as negating the government's claim to be operating democratically.<ref name=nlc />\n\nThe army troops and officers upon whom Busia relied for support were themselves affected, both in their personal lives and in the tightening of the defense budget, by these same austerity measures. As the leader of the anti-Busia coup declared on January 13, 1972, even those amenities enjoyed by the army during the Nkrumah regime were no longer available. Knowing that austerity had alienated the officers, the Busia government began to change the leadership of the army's combat elements. This, however, was the last straw. Lieutenant Colonel [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]], temporarily commanding the First Brigade around Accra, led a bloodless coup that ended the Second Republic.<ref name=nlc />\n\n=== National Redemption Council years, 1972\u201379 ===\nDespite its short existence, the Second Republic was significant in that the development problems the nation faced came clearly into focus. These included uneven distribution of investment funds and favouritism toward certain groups and regions. Important questions about developmental priorities remained unanswered, and after the failure of both the Nkrumah and the Busia regimes (one a one-party state, and the other a multi-party parliamentary democracy) Ghana's path to political stability was obscure.<ref name=nrc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The National Redemption Council Years, 1972\u201379\".</ref>\n\nAcheampong's National Redemption Council (NRC) claimed that it had to act to remove the ill effects of the currency devaluation of the previous government and thereby, at least in the short run, to improve living conditions for individual Ghanaians. To justify their takeover, coup leaders leveled charges of corruption against Busia and his ministers. The NRC sought to create a truly military government and did not outline any plan for the return of the nation to democratic rule.<ref name=nrc />\n\nIn matters of economic policy, Busia's austerity measures were reversed, the Ghanaian currency was revalued upward, foreign debt was repudiated or unilaterally rescheduled, and all large foreign-owned companies were nationalized. The government also provided price supports for basic food imports, while seeking to encourage Ghanaians to become self-reliant in agriculture and the production of raw materials. These measures, while instantly popular, did nothing to solve the country's problems and in fact aggravated the problem of capital flow. Any economic successes were overridden by other basic economic factors. Industry and transportation suffered greatly as oil prices rose in 1974, and the lack of foreign exchange and credit left the country without fuel. Basic food production continued to decline even as the population grew. Disillusionment with the government developed, and accusations of corruption began to surface.<ref name=nrc />\n\nThe reorganization of the NRC into the Supreme Military Council (SMC) in 1975 may have been part of a face-saving attempt. Little input from the civilian sector was allowed, and military officers were put in charge of all ministries and state enterprises down to the local level. During the NRC's early years, these administrative changes led many Ghanaians to hope that the soldiers in command would improve the efficiency of the country's bloated bureaucracies.<ref name=nrc />\n\nShortly after that time, the government sought to stifle opposition by issuing a decree forbidding the propagation of rumors and by banning a number of independent newspapers and detaining their journalists. Also, armed soldiers broke up student demonstrations, and the government repeatedly closed the universities, which had become important centres of opposition to NRC policies. The self-appointed Ashanti General I. K. Acheampong seemed to have much sympathy for women than his ailing economic policies. As the Commissioner(Minister) of Finance, he signed Government checks to concubines and other ladies he barely knew. VW Gulf cars were imported and given to beautiful ladies he came across. Import licenses were given out to friends and ethnic affiliates with impunity.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe SMC by 1977 found itself constrained by mounting non-violent opposition. To be sure, discussions about the nation's political future and its relationship to the SMC had begun in earnest. Although the various opposition groups (university students, lawyers, and other organized civilian groups) called for a return to civilian constitutional rule, Acheampong and the SMC favoured a union government\u2014a mixture of elected civilian and appointed military leaders\u2014but one in which party politics would be abolished. University students and many intellectuals criticized the union government idea, but others, such as Justice [[Gustav Koranteng-Addow]], who chaired the seventeen-member ad hoc committee appointed by the government to work out details of the plan, defended it as the solution to the nation's political problems. Supporters of the union government idea viewed multiparty political contests as the perpetrators of social tension and community conflict among classes, regions, and ethnic groups. Unionists argued that their plan had the potential to depoliticize public life and to allow the nation to concentrate its energies on economic problems.<ref name=nrc />\n\nA national referendum was held in March 1978 to allow the people to accept or reject the union government concept. A rejection of the union government meant a continuation of military rule. Given this choice, it was surprising that so narrow a margin voted in favour of union government. Opponents of the idea organized demonstrations against the government, arguing that the referendum vote had not been free or fair. The Acheampong government reacted by banning several organizations and by jailing as many as 300 of its opponents.<ref name=nrc />\n\nThe agenda for change in the union government referendum called for the drafting of a new constitution by an SMC-appointed commission, the selection of a constituent assembly by November 1978, and general elections in June 1979. The ad hoc committee had recommended a nonparty election, an elected executive president, and a cabinet whose members would be drawn from outside a single-house National Assembly. The military council would then step down, although its members could run for office as individuals.<ref name=nrc />\n\nIn July 1978, in a sudden move, the other SMC officers forced Acheampong to resign, replacing him with Lieutenant General [[Fred Akuffo|Frederick W. K. Akuffo]]. The SMC apparently acted in response to continuing pressure to find a solution to the country's economic dilemma. Inflation was estimated to be as high as 300 percent that year. There were shortages of basic commodities, and cocoa production fell to half its 1964 peak. The council was also motivated by Acheampong's failure to dampen rising political pressure for changes. Akuffo, the new SMC chairman, promised publicly to hand over political power to a new government to be elected by 1 July 1979.<ref name=nrc />\n\nDespite Akuffo's assurances, opposition to the SMC persisted. The call for the formation of political parties intensified. In an effort to gain support in the face of continuing strikes over economic and political issues, the Akuffo government at length announced that the formation of political parties would be allowed after January 1979. Akuffo also granted amnesty to former members of both Nkrumah's CPP and Busia's PP, as well as to all those convicted of subversion under Acheampong. The decree lifting the ban on party politics went into effect on 1 January 1979, as planned. The constitutional assembly that had been working on a new constitution presented an approved draft and adjourned in May. All appeared set for a new attempt at constitutional government in July, when a group of young army officers overthrew the SMC government in June 1979.<ref name=nrc />\n\n=== The Rawlings era ===\nOn 15 May 1979, less than five weeks before constitutional elections were to be held, a group of junior officers led by Flight Lieutenant [[Jerry John Rawlings]] attempted a coup. Initially unsuccessful, the coup leaders were jailed and held for [[court-martial]]. On 4 June, however, sympathetic military officers overthrew the Akuffo regime and released Rawlings and his cohorts from prison fourteen days before the scheduled election. Although the SMC's pledge to return political power to civilian hands addressed the concerns of those who wanted civilian government, the young officers who had staged the June 4 coup insisted that issues critical to the image of the army and important for the stability of national politics had been ignored. [[Naomi Chazan]], a leading analyst of Ghanaian politics, aptly assessed the significance of the 1979 coup in the following statement:<ref name=re>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"Ghana and the Rawlings Era\".</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Unlike the initial SMC II [the Akuffo period, 1978\u20131979] rehabilitation effort which focused on the power elite, this second attempt at reconstruction from a situation of disintegration was propelled by growing alienation. It strove, by reforming the guidelines of public behavior, to define anew the state power structure and to revise its inherent social obligations.... In retrospect the most irreversible outcome of this phase was the systematic eradication of the SMC leadership.... [Their] executions signaled not only the termination of the already fallacious myth of the nonviolence of Ghanaian politics, but, more to the point, the deadly serious determination of the new government to wipe the political slate clean.<ref name=re /></blockquote>\n\nRawlings and the young officers formed the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). The armed forces were purged of senior officers accused of corrupting the image of the military. In carrying out its goal, however, the AFRC was caught between two groups with conflicting interests, Chazan observed. These included the \"soldier-supporters of the AFRC who were happy to lash out at all manifestations of the old regimes; and the now organized political parties who decried the undue violence and advocated change with restraint.<ref name=re />\n\nDespite the coup and the subsequent executions of former heads of military governments (Afrifa of the NLC; Acheampong and some of his associates of the NRC; and Akuffo and leading members of the SMC), the planned elections took place, and Ghana had returned to constitutional rule by the end of September 1979. Before power was granted to the elected government, however, the AFRC sent the unambiguous message that \"people dealing with the public, in whatever capacity, are subject to popular supervision, must abide by fundamental notions of probity, and have an obligation to put the good of the community above personal objective.\" The AFRC position was that the nation's political leaders, at least those from within the military, had not been accountable to the people. The administration of Hilla Limann, inaugurated on 24 September 1979, at the beginning of the Third Republic, was thus expected to measure up to the new standard advocated by the AFRC.<ref name=re />\n\nLimann's People's National Party (PNP) began the Third Republic with control of only seventy-one of the 140 legislative seats. The opposition Popular Front Party (PFP) won forty-two seats, while twenty-six elective positions were distributed among three lesser parties. The percentage of the electorate that voted had fallen to 40 percent. Unlike the country's previous elected leaders, Limann was a former diplomat and a noncharismatic figure with no personal following. As Limann himself observed, the ruling PNP included people of conflicting ideological orientations. They sometimes disagreed strongly among themselves on national policies. Many observers, therefore, wondered whether the new government was equal to the task confronting the state.<ref name=re />\n\nThe most immediate threat to the Limann administration, however, was the AFRC, especially those officers who organized themselves into the \"June 4 Movement\" to monitor the civilian administration. In an effort to keep the AFRC from looking over its shoulder, the government ordered Rawlings and several other army and police officers associated with the AFRC into retirement; nevertheless, Rawlings and his associates remained a latent threat, particularly as the economy continued its decline. The first Limann budget, for fiscal year (FY\u2014see Glossary) 1981, estimated the Ghanaian inflation rate at 70 percent for that year, with a budget deficit equal to 30 percent of the gross national product (GNP\u2014see Glossary). The Trade Union Congress claimed that its workers were no longer earning enough to pay for food, let alone anything else. A rash of strikes, many considered illegal by the government, resulted, each one lowering productivity and therefore national income. In September the government announced that all striking public workers would be dismissed. These factors rapidly eroded the limited support the Limann government enjoyed among civilians and soldiers. The government fell on 31 December 1981, in another Rawlings-led coup.<ref name=re />\n\nRawlings and his colleagues suspended the 1979 constitution, dismissed the president and his cabinet, dissolved the parliament, and proscribed existing political parties. They established the [[Provisional National Defense Council]] (PNDC), initially composed of seven members with Rawlings as chairman, to exercise executive and legislative powers. The existing judicial system was preserved, but alongside it the PNDC created the National Investigation Committee to root out corruption and other economic offenses, the anonymous <!-- There is no Wikipedia article for [[Citizens' Vetting Committee]], Please create a article if you can. Thanks-->''Citizens' Vetting Committee'' to punish tax evasion, and the Public Tribunals to try various crimes. The PNDC proclaimed its intent to allow the people to exercise political power through defense committees to be established in communities, workplaces, and in units of the armed forces and police. Under the PNDC, Ghana remained a unitary government.<ref name=re />\n\nIn December 1982, the PNDC announced a plan to decentralize government from Accra to the regions, the districts, and local communities, but it maintained overall control by appointing regional and district secretaries who exercised executive powers and also chaired regional and district councils. Local councils, however, were expected progressively to take over the payment of salaries, with regions and districts assuming more powers from the national government. In 1984, the PNDC created a National Appeals Tribunal to hear appeals from the public tribunals, changed the Citizens' Vetting Committee into the Office of Revenue Collection and replaced the system of defense committees with Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.<ref name=re />\n\nIn 1984, the PNDC also created a National Commission on Democracy to study ways to establish participatory democracy in Ghana. The commission issued a \"Blue Book\" in July 1987 outlining modalities for district-level elections, which were held in late 1988 and early 1989, for newly created district assemblies. One-third of the assembly members are appointed by the government.<ref name=re />\n\n==== The second coming of Rawlings: the first six years, 1982\u201387 ====\nThe new government that took power on 31 December 1981, was the eighth in the fifteen years since the fall of Nkrumah. Calling itself the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC), its membership included Rawlings as chairman, Brigadier Joseph Nunoo-Mensah (whom Limann had dismissed as army commander), two other officers, and three civilians. Despite its military connections, the PNDC made it clear that it was unlike other soldier-led governments. This was immediately proved by the appointment of fifteen civilians to cabinet positions.<ref name=scr>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The second coming of Rawlings: the first six years, 1982\u201387\".</ref>\n\nIn a radio broadcast on 5 January 1982, Rawlings presented a detailed statement explaining the factors that had necessitated termination of the Third Republic. The PNDC chairman assured the people that he had no intention of imposing himself on Ghanaians. Rather, he \"wanted a chance for the people, farmers, workers, soldiers, the rich and the poor, to be part of the decision-making process.\" He described the two years since the AFRC had handed over power to a civilian government as a period of regression during which political parties attempted to divide the people in order to rule them. The ultimate purpose for the return of Rawlings was, therefore, to \"restore human dignity to Ghanaians.\" In the chairman's words, the dedication of the PNDC to achieving its goals was different from any the country had ever known. It was for that reason that the takeover was not a military coup, but rather a \"holy war\" that would involve the people in the transformation of the socioeconomic structure of the society. The PNDC also served notice to friends and foes alike that any interference in the PNDC agenda would be \"fiercely resisted.\"<ref name=scr />\n\nOpposition to the PNDC administration developed nonetheless in different sectors of the political spectrum. The most obvious groups opposing the government were former PNP and PFP members. They argued that the Third Republic had not been given time to prove itself and that the PNDC administration was unconstitutional. Further opposition came from the [[Ghana Bar Association]] (GBA), which criticized the government's use of people's tribunals in the administration of justice. Members of the Trade Union Congress were also angered when the PNDC ordered them to withdraw demands for increased wages. The National Union of Ghanaian Students (NUGS) went even farther, calling on the government to hand over power to the attorney general, who would supervise new elections.<ref name=scr />\n\nBy the end of June 1982, an attempted coup had been discovered, and those implicated had been executed. Many who disagreed with the PNDC administration were driven into exile, where they began organizing their opposition. They accused the government of human rights abuses and political intimidation, which forced the country, especially the press, into a \"culture of silence.\"<ref name=scr />\n\nMeanwhile, the PNDC was subjected to the influence of contrasting political philosophies and goals. Although the revolutionary leaders agreed on the need for radical change, they differed on the means of achieving it. For example, John Ndebugre, secretary for agriculture in the PNDC government, who was later appointed northern regional secretary (governor), belonged to the radical Kwame Nkrumah Revolutionary Guard, an extreme left-wing organization that advocated a Marxist\u2013Leninist course for the PNDC. He was detained and jailed for most of the latter part of the 1980s. Other members of the PNDC, including Kojo Tsikata, P.V. Obeng, and Kwesi Botchwey, were believed to be united only by their determination either to uplift the country from its desperate conditions or to protect themselves from vocal opposition.<ref name=scr />\n\nIn keeping with Rawlings's commitment to populism as a political principle, the PNDC began to form governing coalitions and institutions that would incorporate the populace at large into the machinery of the national government. Workers' Defence Committees (WDCs), People's Defence Committees (PDCs), Citizens' Vetting Committees (CVCs), Regional Defence Committees (RDCs), and National Defence Committees (NDCs) were all created to ensure that those at the bottom of society were given the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. These committees were to be involved in community projects and community decisions, and individual members were expected to expose corruption and \"anti-social activities\". Public tribunals, which were established outside the normal legal system, were also created to try those accused of antigovernment acts. And a four-week workshop aimed at making these cadres morally and intellectually prepared for their part in the revolution was completed at the University of Ghana, Legon, in July and August 1983.<ref name=scr />\n\nVarious opposition groups criticized the PDCs and WDCs, however. The aggressiveness of certain WDCs, it was argued, interfered with management's ability to make the bold decisions needed for the recovery of the national economy. In response to such criticisms, the PNDC announced on 1 December 1984, the dissolution of all PDCs, WDCs, and NDCs, and their replacement with Committees for the Defence of the Revolution (CDRs). With regard to public boards and statutory corporations, excluding banks and financial institutions, Joint Consultative Committees (JCCs) that acted as advisory bodies to managing directors were created.<ref name=scr />\n\nThe public tribunals, however, despite their characterization as undemocratic by the GBA, were maintained. Although the tribunals had been established in 1982, the law providing for the creation of a national public tribunal to hear and determine appeals from, and decisions of, regional public tribunals was not passed until August 1984. Section 3 and Section 10 of the PNDC Establishment Proclamation limited public tribunals to cases of a political and an economic nature. The limitations placed on public tribunals by the government in 1984 may have been an attempt by the administration to redress certain weaknesses. The tribunals, however, were not abolished; rather, they were defended as \"fundamental to a good legal system\" that needed to be maintained in response to \"growing legal consciousness on the part of the people.\"<ref name=scr />\n\nAt the time when the foundations of these sociopolitical institutions were being laid, the PNDC was also engaged in a debate about how to finance the reconstruction of the national economy. The country had indeed suffered from what some described as the excessive and unwise, if not foolish, expenditures of the Nkrumah regime. The degree of decline under the NRC and the SMC had also been devastating. By December 1981, when the PNDC came to power, the inflation rate topped 200 percent, while real GDP had declined by 3 percent per annum for seven years. Not only cocoa production but even diamonds and timber exports had dropped dramatically. Gold production had also fallen to half its preindependence level.<ref name=scr />\n\nGhana's sorry economic condition, according to the PNDC, had resulted in part from the absence of good political leadership. In fact, as early as the AFRC administration in 1979, Rawlings and his associates had accused three former military leaders (generals Afrifa, Acheampong, and Akuffo) of corruption and greed and of thereby contributing to the national crisis and had executed them on the basis of this accusation. In other words, the AFRC in 1979 attributed the national crisis to internal, primarily political, causes. The overthrow of the Limann administration by the PNDC in 1981 was an attempt to prevent another inept administration from aggravating an already bad economic situation. By implication, the way to resolve some of the problems was to stabilize the political situation and to improve the economic conditions of the nation radically.<ref name=scr />\n\nAt the end of its first year in power, the PNDC announced a four-year programme of economic austerity and sacrifice that was to be the first phase of an Economic Recovery Programme (ERP). If the economy were to improve significantly, there was need for a large injection of capital\u2014a resource that could only be obtained from international financial institutions of the West. There were those on the PNDC's ideological left, however, who rejected consultation with such agencies because these institutions were blamed in part for the nation's predicament. Precisely because some members of the government also held such views, the PNDC secretary for finance and economic planning, Kwesi Botchwey, felt the need to justify World Bank (see Glossary) assistance to Ghana in 1983:<ref name=scr />\n\n<blockquote>It would be naive and unrealistic for certain sections of the Ghanaian society to think that the request for economic assistance from the World Bank and its affiliates means a sell-out of the aims and objectives of the Ghanaian revolution to the international community.... It does not make sense for the country to become a member of the bank and the IMF and continue to pay its dues only to decline to utilize the resources of these two institutions.<ref name=scr /></blockquote>\n\nThe PNDC recognized that it could not depend on friendly nations such as Libya to address the economic problems of Ghana. The magnitude of the crisis\u2014made worse by widespread bush fires that devastated crop production in 1983\u20131984 and by the return of more than one million Ghanaians who had been expelled from Nigeria in 1983, which had intensified the unemployment situation\u2014called for monetary assistance from institutions with bigger financial chests.<ref name=scr />\n\nPhase One of the ERP began in 1983. Its goal was economic stability. In broad terms, the government wanted to reduce inflation and to create confidence in the nation's ability to recover. By 1987 progress was clearly evident. The rate of inflation had dropped to 20 percent, and between 1983 and 1987, Ghana's economy reportedly grew at 6 percent per year. Official assistance from donor countries to Ghana's recovery programmeaveraged US$430 million in 1987, more than double that of the preceding years. The PNDC administration also made a remarkable payment of more than US$500 million in loan arrears dating to before 1966. In recognition of these achievements, international agencies had pledged more than US$575 million to the country's future programmes by May 1987. With these accomplishments in place, the PNDC inaugurated Phase Two of the ERP, which envisioned privatization of state-owned assets, currency devaluation, and increased savings and investment, and which was to continue until 1990.<ref name=scr />\n\nNotwithstanding the successes of Phase One of the ERP, many problems remained, and both friends and foes of the PNDC were quick to point them out. One commentator noted the high rate of Ghanaian unemployment as a result of the belt-tightening policies of the PNDC. In the absence of employment or redeployment policies to redress such problems, he wrote, the effects of the austerity programmes might create circumstances that could derail the PNDC recovery agenda.<ref name=scr />\n\nUnemployment was only one aspect of the political problems facing the PNDC government; another was the size and breadth of the PNDC's political base. The PNDC initially espoused a populist programme that appealed to a wide variety of rural and urban constituents. Even so, the PNDC was the object of significant criticism from various groups that in one way or another called for a return to constitutional government. Much of this criticism came from student organizations, the GBA, and opposition groups in self-imposed exile, who questioned the legitimacy of the military government and its declared intention of returning the country to constitutional rule. So vocal was the outcry against the PNDC that it appeared on the surface as if the PNDC enjoyed little support among those groups who had historically moulded and influenced Ghanaian public opinion. At a time when difficult policies were being implemented, the PNDC could ill afford the continued alienation and opposition of such prominent critics.<ref name=scr />\n\nBy the mid-1980s, therefore, it had become essential that the PNDC demonstrate that it was actively considering steps towards constitutionalism and civilian rule. This was true notwithstanding the recognition of Rawlings as an honest leader and the perception that the situation he was trying to redress was not of his creation. To move in the desired direction, the PNDC needed to weaken the influence and credibility of all antagonistic groups while it created the necessary political structures that would bring more and more Ghanaians into the process of national reconstruction. The PNDC's solution to its dilemma was the proposal for district assemblies.<ref name=scr />\n\n==== District assemblies ====\nAlthough the National Commission for Democracy (NCD) had existed as an agency of the PNDC since 1982, it was not until September 1984 that Justice Daniel F. Annan, himself a member of the ruling council, was appointed chairman. The official inauguration of the NCD in January 1985 signaled PNDC determination to move the nation in a new political direction. According to its mandate, the NCD was to devise a viable democratic system, utilizing public discussions. Annan explained the necessity for the commission's work by arguing that the political party system of the past lost track of the country's socio-economic development processes. There was the need, therefore, to search for a new political order that would be functionally democratic. Constitutional rules of the past were not acceptable to the new revolutionary spirit, Annan continued, which saw the old political order as using the ballot box \"merely to ensure that politicians got elected into power, after which communication between the electorate and their elected representative completely broke down.\"<ref name=da>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The District Assemblies\".</ref>\n\nAfter two years of deliberations and public hearings, the NCD recommended the formation of district assemblies as local governing institutions that would offer opportunities to the ordinary person to become involved in the political process. The PNDC scheduled elections of the proposed assemblies for the last quarter of 1988.<ref name=\"da\" />\n\nIf, as Rawlings said, the PNDC revolution was a \"holy war,\" then the proposed assemblies were part of a PNDC policy intended to annihilate enemy forces or, at least, to reduce them to impotence. The strategy was to deny the opposition a legitimate political forum within which it could articulate its objections to the government. It was for this reason, as much as it was for those stated by Annan, that a five-member District Assembly Committee was created in each of the nation's 110 administrative districts and was charged by the NCD with ensuring that all candidates followed electoral rules. The district committees were to disqualify automatically any candidate who had a record of criminal activity, insanity, or imprisonment involving fraud or electoral offenses in the past, especially after 1979. Also barred from elections were all professionals accused of fraud, dishonesty, and malpractice. The ban on political parties, instituted at the time of the Rawlings coup, was to continue.<ref name=da />\n\nBy barring candidates associated with corruption and mismanagement of national resources from running for district assembly positions, the PNDC hoped to establish new values to govern political behaviour in Ghana. To do so effectively, the government also made it illegal for candidates to mount campaign platforms other than the one defined by the NCD. Every person qualified to vote in the district could propose candidates or be nominated as a candidate. Candidates could not be nominated by organizations and associations but had to run for district office on the basis of personal qualifications and service to their communities.<ref name=da />\n\nOnce in session, an assembly was to become the highest political authority in each district. Assembly members were to be responsible for deliberation, evaluation, coordination, and implementation of programmes accepted as appropriate for the district's economic development; however, district assemblies were to be subject to the general guidance and direction of the central government. To ensure that district developments were in line with national policies, one-third of assembly members were to be traditional authorities (chiefs) or their representatives; these members were to be approved by the PNDC in consultation with the traditional authorities and other \"productive economic groups in the district.\" In other words, a degree of autonomy may have been granted to the assemblies in the determination of programmes most suited to the districts, but the PNDC left itself with the ultimate responsibility of making sure that such programmes were in line with the national economic recovery programme.<ref name=da />\n\nDistrict assemblies as outlined in PNDC documents were widely discussed by friends and foes of the government. Some hailed the proposal as compatible with the goal of granting the people opportunities to manage their own affairs, but others (especially those of the political right) accused the government of masking its intention to remain in power. If the government's desire for democracy were genuine, a timetable for national elections should have been its priority rather than the preoccupation with local government, they argued. Some questioned the wisdom of incorporating traditional chiefs and the degree to which these traditional leaders would be committed to the district assembly idea, while others attacked the election guidelines as undemocratic and, therefore, as contributing to a culture of silence in Ghana. To such critics, the district assemblies were nothing but a move by the PNDC to consolidate its position.<ref name=da />\n\nRawlings, however, responded to such criticism by restating the PNDC strategy and the rationale behind it:<ref name=da />\n\n<blockquote>Steps towards more formal political participation are being taken through the district-level elections that we will be holding throughout the country as part of our decentralisation policy. As I said in my nationwide broadcast on December 31, if we are to see a sturdy tree of democracy grow, we need to learn from the past and nurture very carefully and deliberately political institutions that will become the pillars upon which the people's power will be erected. A new sense of responsibility must be created in each workplace, each village, each district; we already see elements of this in the work of the CDRs, the December 31 Women's Movement, the June 4 Movement, Town and Village Development Committees, and other organizations through which the voice of the people is being heard.<ref name=da /></blockquote>\n\nAs for the categorization of certain PNDC policies as \"leftist\" and \"rightist,\" Rawlings dismissed such allegations as \"remarkably simplistic \u2026 What is certain is that we are moving forward!\" For the PNDC, therefore, the district elections constituted an obvious first step in a political process that was to culminate at the national level.<ref name=da />\n\nRawlings's explanation notwithstanding, various opposition groups continued to describe the PNDC-proposed district assemblies as a mere public relations ploy designed to give political legitimacy to a government that had come to power by unconstitutional means. Longtime observers of the Ghanaian political scene, however, identified two major issues at stake in the conflict between the government and its critics: the means by which political stability was to be achieved, and the problem of attaining sustained economic growth. Both had preoccupied the country since the era of Nkrumah. The economic recovery programmes implemented by the PNDC in 1983 and the proposal for district assemblies in 1987 were major elements in the government's strategy to address these fundamental and persistent problems. Both were very much part of the national debate in Ghana in the late 1980s.<ref name=da />\n\n==== End of one-party state ====\n[[File:Ghana's 50th Independence Anniversary.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ghana's 50th Independence Anniversary parade in Accra, March 2007.]]\nUnder international and domestic pressure for a return to democracy, the PNDC allowed the establishment of a 258-member Consultative Assembly made up of members representing geographic districts as well as established civic or business organizations. The assembly was charged to draw up a draft constitution to establish a fourth republic, using PNDC proposals. The PNDC accepted the final product without revision, and it was put to a [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1992|national referendum]] on 28 April 1992, in which it received 92% approval.\n\nOn 18 May 1992, the ban on party politics was lifted in preparation for multi-party elections. The PNDC and its supporters formed a new party, the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] (NDC), to contest the elections. [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1992|Presidential elections]] were held on 3 November and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections]] on 29 December that year. Members of the opposition boycotted the parliamentary elections, however, which resulted in a 200-seat Parliament with only 17 opposition party members and two independents.\n\n=== The Fourth Republic (1993\u2013present)===\nThe Constitution entered into force on 7 January 1993, to found the Fourth Republic. On that day, Rawlings was inaugurated as President and members of Parliament swore their oaths of office. In 1996, the opposition fully contested the [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1996|presidential]] and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1996|parliamentary elections]], which were described as peaceful, free, and transparent by domestic and international observers. Rawlings was re-elected with 57% of the popular vote. In addition, Rawlings' NDC party won 133 of the Parliament's 200 seats, just one seat short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution, although the election returns of two parliamentary seats faced legal challenges.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2000, Jerry Rawlings endorsed his vice president, John Atta-Mills, as the candidate for the ruling NDC. [[John Kufuor]] stood for the [[New Patriotic Party]] (NPP), won the election, and became the president on 7 January 2001. The vice president was [[Aliu Mahama]]. The presidential election of 2000 was viewed as free and fair.<ref>[http://www.demcoalition.org/pdf/Ghana.pdf Defending Democracy: A Global Survey of Foreign Policy Trends 1992\u20132002 Democracy Coalition Project]. demcoalition.org.</ref> Kufuor won another term again in the presidential election in 2004.\n\nThe presidency of Kufuor saw several social reforms, such as the reform in the system of [[National Health Insurance (Ghana)|National Health Insurance]] of Ghana in 2003.<ref>Pflanz, Mike.

The ruling [[New Patriotic Party]] chose [[Nana Akufo-Addo]], son of Edward Akufo-Addo, as their candidate while [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress's]] [[John Atta Mills]] stood for the third time. After a run-off, John Atta Mills won the election.\nOn 24 July 2012, Ghana suffered a shocking blow when their president died. Power was then given to his vice-president, [[John Dramani Mahama]]. He chose the then Governor of the [[Bank of Ghana]], [[Kwesi Amissah-Arthur]], as his vice. The National Democratic Congress won the 2012 election, making John Mahama rule again, his first term.\n\n[[John Atta Mills]] was sworn in as president on 7 January 2009 in a peaceful transition after Kufor was narrowly defeated.<ref>Emmanuel Gyimah-Boadi, \"The 2008 Freedom House Survey: Another Step Forward for Ghana.\" ''Journal of Democracy'' 20.2 (2009): 138-152 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/262756/summary excerpt].</ref>\n\n==Religious history==\n{{Main|Religion in Ghana|Christianity in Ghana|Methodist Church Ghana|Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana|Roman Catholicism in Ghana|Basel Mission|Islam in Ghana}}\nPortuguese Catholic missionaries arrived on the coast in the fifteenth century.
