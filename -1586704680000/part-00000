Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprisings of kolis were in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire.

The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprisings of kolis were in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

His father was a consular official under the [[Consul General]] At\u0131f Kor in the Bari Consulate of Turkey,<ref name=\"rg1\"/> and a writer. He wrote a book on Greek and Roman Mythology,<ref name=\"kd\"/> and another one titled \"Petrarca\", published in 1931, stating in its preface: \"The best way (for Turkey) is adopting the Western culture.\"<ref name=\"nhs\"/> Following his father's recall to Turkey in July 1938, the family returned to Turkey before the start of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"rg2\"/><ref name=\"yn1\"/> He had a sister, [[Esin Af\u015far]] (1936-2011), who became a well-known singer and actress.<ref name=\"s1\"/>\n\nSinano\u011flu graduated from [[TED Ankara Koleji]] in 1951. He went to the United States in 1953, where he studied in [[University of California, Berkeley]]  graduating with a BSc degree with highest honors in 1956. The following year, he completed his MSc at [[MIT]] (1957), and was awarded [[Sloan Research Fellowship]]. He completed his [[predoctoral fellow]]ship (1958-1959) and earned his PhD in physical chemistry (1959-1960) from the University of California, Berkeley.<ref name=\"yn1\"/><ref name=\"s1\"/><ref name=\"nyt1\"/>\n\nOn December 21, 1963, Oktay Sinano\u011flu married to Paula Armbruster,<ref name=\"m\"/> who was doing graduate work at Yale University. The wedding ceremony took place in the [[Branford College]] Chapel of Yale.<ref name=\"nyt1\"/>\n\nHe remarried to Dilek Sinano\u011flu and from this marriage he became father of twins.

It is believed that he was the third-youngest full professor in the 300-plus year history of [[Yale University]].<ref name=\"yn1\"/>\n\nIn 1964, he founded the [[theoretical chemistry]] division at Yale.

{"title_page": "Soliton", "text_new": "The soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by [[John Russell (engineer)|John Scott Russell]] (1808\u20131882) who observed a solitary wave in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] in Scotland. He reproduced the phenomenon in a [[wave tank]] and named it the \"[[John Russell (engineer)#The wave of translation|Wave of Translation]]\".\n\n==Definition==\nA single, consensus definition of a soliton is difficult to find. {{harvtxt|Drazin|Johnson|1989|p=15}} ascribe three properties to solitons:\n# They are of permanent form;\n# They are localized within a region;\n# They can interact with other solitons, and emerge from the collision unchanged, except for a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]].\n\nMore formal definitions exist, but they require substantial mathematics. Moreover, some scientists use the term ''soliton'' for phenomena that do not quite have these three properties (for instance, the '[[light bullet]]s' of [[nonlinear optics]] are often called solitons despite losing energy during interaction).<ref>{{cite web|title=Light bullets|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~renns/lbullets.html#bullets}}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Sech soliton.svg|thumb|300px|right|A [[hyperbolic secant]] (sech) envelope soliton for water waves: The blue line is the [[carrier signal]], while the red line is the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] soliton.]]\n[[Dispersion relation|Dispersion]] and [[nonlinearity]] can interact to produce permanent and localized [[wave]] forms.  Consider a pulse of light traveling in glass. This pulse can be thought of as consisting of light of several different frequencies.  Since glass shows dispersion, these different frequencies travel at different speeds and the shape of the pulse therefore changes over time. However, also the nonlinear [[Kerr effect]] occurs; the [[refractive index]] of a material at a given frequency depends on the light's amplitude or strength. If the pulse has just the right shape, the Kerr effect exactly cancels the dispersion effect, and the pulse's shape does not change over time, thus is a soliton. See [[soliton (optics)]] for a more detailed description.\n\nMany [[exactly solvable model]]s have soliton solutions, including the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]], the [[nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], the coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and the [[sine-Gordon equation]]. The soliton solutions are typically obtained by means of the [[inverse scattering transform]], and owe their stability to the [[integrable system|integrability]] of the field equations. The mathematical theory of these equations is a broad and very active field of mathematical research.\n\nSome types of [[tidal bore]], a wave phenomenon of a few rivers including the [[River Severn]], are 'undular': a wavefront followed by a train of solitons. Other solitons occur as the undersea [[internal wave]]s, initiated by [[seabed topography]], that propagate on the oceanic [[pycnocline]]. Atmospheric solitons also exist, such as the [[morning glory cloud]] of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], where pressure solitons traveling in a [[temperature inversion]] layer produce vast linear [[roll cloud]]s. The recent and not widely accepted [[soliton model]] in [[neuroscience]] proposes to explain the signal conduction within [[neuron]]s as pressure solitons.\n\nA [[topological soliton]], also called a topological defect, is any solution of a set of [[partial differential equation]]s that is stable against decay to the \"trivial solution\". Soliton stability is due to topological constraints, rather than integrability of the field equations. The constraints arise almost always because the differential equations must obey a set of [[boundary conditions]], and the boundary has a nontrivial [[homotopy group]], preserved by the differential equations. Thus, the differential equation solutions can be classified into [[homotopy class]]es.\n\nNo continuous transformation maps a solution in one homotopy class to another. The solutions are truly distinct, and maintain their integrity, even in the face of extremely powerful forces. Examples of topological solitons include the [[screw dislocation]] in a [[crystalline lattice]], the [[Dirac string]] and the [[magnetic monopole]] in [[electromagnetism]], the [[Skyrmion]] and the [[Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Witten model]] in [[quantum field theory]], the [[magnetic skyrmion]] in condensed matter physics, and [[cosmic string]]s and [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1834, [[John Scott Russell]] describes his ''[[wave of translation]]''.<ref group=nb>\"Translation\" \n\n{{quote|I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along a narrow channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped&nbsp;\u2013 not so the mass of water in the channel which it had put in motion; it accumulated round the prow of the vessel in a state of violent agitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, rolled forward with great velocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed. I followed it on horseback, and overtook it still rolling on at a rate of some eight or nine miles an hour, preserving its original figure some thirty feet long and a foot to a foot and a half in height. Its height gradually diminished, and after a chase of one or two miles I lost it in the windings of the channel. Such, in the month of August 1834, was my first chance interview with that singular and beautiful phenomenon which I have called the Wave of Translation.<ref>{{cite book |first=J. |last=Scott Russell |authorlink=John Scott Russell |contribution=Report on waves |title=Fourteenth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science |year=1844}}</ref>}}\n\nScott Russell spent some time making practical and theoretical investigations of these waves.\n\nScott Russell's experimental work seemed at odds with [[Isaac Newton]]'s and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s theories of [[hydrodynamics]]. [[George Biddell Airy]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]] had difficulty accepting Scott Russell's experimental observations because they could not be explained by the existing water wave theories.  Their contemporaries spent some time attempting to extend the theory but it would take until the 1870s before [[Joseph Boussinesq]]<ref> Boussinesq, J. \"Th\u00e9orie de l'intumescence liquide appel\u00e9e onde solitaire ou de translation, se propageant dans un canal rectangulaire.\" C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 72, 1871.</ref> and [[Lord Rayleigh]] published a theoretical treatment and solutions.<ref group=nb>[[Lord Rayleigh]] published a paper in ''Philosophical Magazine'' in 1876 to support John Scott Russell's experimental observation with his mathematical theory. In his 1876 paper, Lord Rayleigh mentioned Scott Russell's name and also admitted that the first theoretical treatment was by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq in 1871. [[Joseph Boussinesq]] mentioned Russell's name in his 1871 paper. Thus Scott Russell's observations on solitons were accepted as true by some prominent scientists within his own lifetime of 1808\u20131882.</ref> In 1895 [[Diederik Korteweg]] and [[Gustav de Vries]] provided what is now known as the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]], including solitary wave and periodic [[cnoidal wave]] solutions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Korteweg  | first1 = D.

Solitons in a fiber optic system are described by the [[Manakov equations]].\nSolitons' inherent stability make long-distance transmission possible without the use of [[repeater]]s, and could potentially double transmission capacity as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172302644 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728111145/http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172302644 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 28, 2012 |title=Photons advance on two fronts |publisher=EETimes.com |date=October 24, 2005 |accessdate=2011-02-15 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!

He also proposed the idea of a soliton-based transmission system to increase performance of optical [[telecommunication]]s.\n|-\n| 1987\n| {{harvtxt|Emplit|Hamaide|Reynaud|Froehly|1987}}&nbsp;\u2013 from the Universities of Brussels and Limoges&nbsp;\u2013 made the first experimental observation of the propagation of a [[dark soliton]], in an optical fiber.\n|-\n| 1988\n| Linn Mollenauer and his team transmitted soliton pulses over 4,000 kilometers using a phenomenon called the [[Raman effect]], named after [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman|Sir C. V. Raman]] who first described it in the 1920s, to provide [[optical gain]] in the fiber.\n|-\n| 1991\n| A Bell Labs research team transmitted solitons error-free at 2.5 gigabits per second over more than 14,000 kilometers, using [[erbium]] optical fiber amplifiers (spliced-in segments of optical fiber containing the rare earth element erbium). Pump lasers, coupled to the optical amplifiers, activate the erbium, which energizes the light pulses.\n|-\n| 1998\n| Thierry Georges and his team at [[France Telecom]] R&D Center, combining optical solitons of different [[wavelength]]s ([[wavelength-division multiplexing]]), demonstrated a ''composite'' data transmission of 1 [[Binary prefix|terabit]] per second (1,000,000,000,000 units of information per second), not to be confused with Terabit-Ethernet.\n\nThe above impressive experiments have not translated to actual commercial soliton system deployments however, in either terrestrial or submarine systems, chiefly due to the [[James P. Gordon#Solitons and optical communications|Gordon\u2013Haus (GH) jitter]]. The GH jitter requires sophisticated, expensive compensatory solutions that ultimately makes [[Wavelength-division multiplexing#Dense WDM|dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM)]] soliton transmission in the field unattractive, compared to the conventional non-return-to-zero/return-to-zero paradigm. Further, the likely future adoption of the more spectrally efficient phase-shift-keyed/QAM formats makes soliton transmission even less viable, due to the Gordon\u2013Mollenauer effect. Consequently, the long-haul fiberoptic transmission soliton has remained a laboratory curiosity.\n|-\n| 2000\n| Cundiff predicted the existence of a [[vector soliton]] in a birefringence fiber cavity passively mode locking through a [[SESAM|semiconductor saturable absorber mirror]] (SESAM).

Solitons are caused by a cancellation of [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] and [[dispersion relation|dispersive effects]] in the medium. (Dispersive effects are a property of certain systems where the speed of a wave depends on its frequency.) Solitons are the solutions of a widespread class of weakly nonlinear dispersive [[partial differential equation]]s describing physical systems.\n\nThe soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by [[John Russell (engineer)|John Scott Russell]] (1808\u20131882) who observed a solitary wave in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] in Scotland. He reproduced the phenomenon in a [[wave tank]] and named it the \"[[John Russell (engineer)#The wave of translation|Wave of Translation]]\".\n\n==Definition==\nA single, consensus definition of a soliton is difficult to find. {{harvtxt|Drazin|Johnson|1989|p=15}} ascribe three properties to solitons:\n# They are of permanent form;\n# They are localized within a region;\n# They can interact with other solitons, and emerge from the collision unchanged, except for a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]].\n\nMore formal definitions exist, but they require substantial mathematics. Moreover, some scientists use the term ''soliton'' for phenomena that do not quite have these three properties (for instance, the '[[light bullet]]s' of [[nonlinear optics]] are often called solitons despite losing energy during interaction).<ref>{{cite web|title=Light bullets|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~renns/lbullets.html#bullets}}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Sech soliton.svg|thumb|300px|right|A [[hyperbolic secant]] (sech) envelope soliton for water waves: The blue line is the [[carrier signal]], while the red line is the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] soliton.]]\n[[Dispersion relation|Dispersion]] and [[nonlinearity]] can interact to produce permanent and localized [[wave]] forms.  Consider a pulse of light traveling in glass. This pulse can be thought of as consisting of light of several different frequencies.  Since glass shows dispersion, these different frequencies travel at different speeds and the shape of the pulse therefore changes over time. However, also the nonlinear [[Kerr effect]] occurs; the [[refractive index]] of a material at a given frequency depends on the light's amplitude or strength. If the pulse has just the right shape, the Kerr effect exactly cancels the dispersion effect, and the pulse's shape does not change over time, thus is a soliton. See [[soliton (optics)]] for a more detailed description.\n\nMany [[exactly solvable model]]s have soliton solutions, including the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]], the [[nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], the coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and the [[sine-Gordon equation]]. The soliton solutions are typically obtained by means of the [[inverse scattering transform]], and owe their stability to the [[integrable system|integrability]] of the field equations. The mathematical theory of these equations is a broad and very active field of mathematical research.\n\nSome types of [[tidal bore]], a wave phenomenon of a few rivers including the [[River Severn]], are 'undular': a wavefront followed by a train of solitons. Other solitons occur as the undersea [[internal wave]]s, initiated by [[seabed topography]], that propagate on the oceanic [[pycnocline]]. Atmospheric solitons also exist, such as the [[morning glory cloud]] of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], where pressure solitons traveling in a [[temperature inversion]] layer produce vast linear [[roll cloud]]s. The recent and not widely accepted [[soliton model]] in [[neuroscience]] proposes to explain the signal conduction within [[neuron]]s as pressure solitons.\n\nA [[topological soliton]], also called a topological defect, is any solution of a set of [[partial differential equation]]s that is stable against decay to the \"trivial solution\". Soliton stability is due to topological constraints, rather than integrability of the field equations. The constraints arise almost always because the differential equations must obey a set of [[boundary conditions]], and the boundary has a nontrivial [[homotopy group]], preserved by the differential equations. Thus, the differential equation solutions can be classified into [[homotopy class]]es.\n\nNo continuous transformation maps a solution in one homotopy class to another. The solutions are truly distinct, and maintain their integrity, even in the face of extremely powerful forces. Examples of topological solitons include the [[screw dislocation]] in a [[crystalline lattice]], the [[Dirac string]] and the [[magnetic monopole]] in [[electromagnetism]], the [[Skyrmion]] and the [[Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Witten model]] in [[quantum field theory]], the [[magnetic skyrmion]] in condensed matter physics, and [[cosmic string]]s and [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1834, [[John Scott Russell]] describes his ''[[wave of translation]]''.<ref group=nb>\"Translation\" here means that there is real mass transport, although it is not the same water which is transported from one end of the canal to the other end by this \"Wave of Translation\". Rather, a [[fluid parcel]] acquires [[momentum]] during the passage of the solitary wave, and comes to rest again after the passage of the wave. But the fluid parcel has been displaced substantially forward during the process&nbsp;\u2013 by [[Stokes drift]] in the wave propagation direction. And a net mass transport is the result. Usually there is little mass transport from one side to another side for ordinary waves.</ref> The discovery is described here in Scott Russell's own words:<ref group=nb>This passage has been repeated in many papers and books on soliton theory.</ref>\n\n{{quote|I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along a narrow channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped&nbsp;\u2013 not so the mass of water in the channel which it had put in motion; it accumulated round the prow of the vessel in a state of violent agitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, rolled forward with great velocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed. I followed it on horseback, and overtook it still rolling on at a rate of some eight or nine miles an hour, preserving its original figure some thirty feet long and a foot to a foot and a half in height. Its height gradually diminished, and after a chase of one or two miles I lost it in the windings of the channel. Such, in the month of August 1834, was my first chance interview with that singular and beautiful phenomenon which I have called the Wave of Translation.<ref>{{cite book |first=J. |last=Scott Russell |authorlink=John Scott Russell |contribution=Report on waves |title=Fourteenth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science |year=1844}}</ref>}}\n\nScott Russell spent some time making practical and theoretical investigations of these waves. He built wave tanks at his home and noticed some key properties:\n* The waves are stable, and can travel over very large distances (normal waves would tend to either flatten out, or steepen and topple over)\n* The speed depends on the size of the wave, and its width on the depth of water.\n* Unlike normal waves they will never merge&nbsp;\u2013 so a small wave is overtaken by a large one, rather than the two combining.\n* If a wave is too big for the depth of water, it splits into two, one big and one small.\n\nScott Russell's experimental work seemed at odds with [[Isaac Newton]]'s and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s theories of [[hydrodynamics]]. [[George Biddell Airy]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]] had difficulty accepting Scott Russell's experimental observations because they could not be explained by the existing water wave theories.  Their contemporaries spent some time attempting to extend the theory but it would take until the 1870s before [[Joseph Boussinesq]]<ref> Boussinesq, J. \"Th\u00e9orie de l'intumescence liquide appel\u00e9e onde solitaire ou de translation, se propageant dans un canal rectangulaire.\" C.

[[Joseph Boussinesq]] mentioned Russell's name in his 1871 paper.

Pump lasers, coupled to the optical amplifiers, activate the erbium, which energizes the light pulses.\n|-\n| 1998\n| Thierry Georges and his team at [[France Telecom]] R&D Center, combining optical solitons of different [[wavelength]]s ([[wavelength-division multiplexing]]), demonstrated a ''composite'' data transmission of 1 [[Binary prefix|terabit]] per second (1,000,000,000,000 units of information per second), not to be confused with Terabit-Ethernet.\n\nThe above impressive experiments have not translated to actual commercial soliton system deployments however, in either terrestrial or submarine systems, chiefly due to the [[James P. Gordon#Solitons and optical communications|Gordon\u2013Haus (GH) jitter]]. The GH jitter requires sophisticated, expensive compensatory solutions that ultimately makes [[Wavelength-division multiplexing#Dense WDM|dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM)]] soliton transmission in the field unattractive, compared to the conventional non-return-to-zero/return-to-zero paradigm. Further, the likely future adoption of the more spectrally efficient phase-shift-keyed/QAM formats makes soliton transmission even less viable, due to the Gordon\u2013Mollenauer effect.

In some physical contexts (for instance string theory) this feature can be important, which motivated the introduction of a special name for this class of solitons.\n\nOn the other hand, when gravity is added (i.e. when considering the coupling of the Born\u2013Infeld model to general relativity) the corresponding solution is called ''EBIon'', where \"E\" stands for Einstein.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Compacton]], a soliton with compact support\n* [[Freak wave]]s may be a [[Peregrine soliton]] related phenomenon involving [[breather]] waves which exhibit concentrated localized energy with non-linear properties.<ref name=\"www.sciencenews.org\">{{cite magazine\n| last = Powell\n| first = Devin\n| title = Rogue Waves Captured\n| url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/74610/title/Rogue_waves_captured\n| magazine = Science News\n| date = 20 May 2011\n| accessdate = 24 May 2011\n}}</ref>\n* [[Nematicon]]s\n* [[Non-topological soliton]], in [[quantum field theory]]\n* [[Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n* [[Oscillon]]s\n* [[Pattern formation]]\n* [[Peakon]], a soliton with a non-differentiable peak\n* [[Q-ball]] a non-topological soliton\n* [[Sine-Gordon equation]]\n* [[Soliton (topological)]]\n* [[Soliton distribution]]\n* [[Ball lightning#Soliton hypothesis|Soliton hypothesis for ball lightning]], by [[David Finkelstein]]\n* [[Soliton model]] of nerve impulse propagation\n* [[Topological quantum number]]\n* [[Vector soliton]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite journal |first1=N.

The constituency also contains many rural and suburban wards, which during the same period generally had a majority in support of the Conservatives. The constituency stretches from the edge of the [[Peak District]] to the northern edge of [[Derby]], which forms another set of neighbourhoods more favourably disposed to the Conservatives.\n\nSince 2000 the conservatives have controlled [[Amber Valley|Amber Valley Borough Council]] with the exception of 2014-2015 and again in 2019 when Labour has been in power. Prior to this, the council was held by Labour or under no overall control for all but three years from its formation in 1973.\n\nThe constituency's generally small majorities in recent elections (an exception being the 2017 result) and [[bellwether]] status since 1983 (being won by the party that nationally holds the most parliamentary seats) means Amber Valley is, by most common measures, a

constituency was created in 1983, and was held by [[Phillip Oppenheim]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from its creation until [[Judy Mallaber]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the seat in 1997. She was narrowly defeated in 2010 by [[Nigel Mills]], a Conservative, who increased his majority in 2015 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/orderedseats.html|title=Majority Sorted Seats|work=electoralcalculus.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Boundaries==\n[[Image:AmberValleyConstituency.svg|thumb|left|100px|Boundaries of Amber Valley from 1997 to 2010]]\n'''1983\u20131997''': The District of Amber Valley wards of Aldercar, Alfreton East, Alfreton West, Codnor, Denby and Horsley Woodhouse, Heage and Ambergate, Heanor and Loscoe, Heanor East, Heanor West, Holbrook and Horsley, Kilburn, Riddings, Ripley, Ripley and Marehay, Shipley Park, Somercotes, Swanwick, and Wingfield, and the Borough of Erewash wards of Breadsall and Morley, Little Eaton, and Stanley.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Amber Valley wards of Aldercar, Alfreton East, Alfreton West, Codnor, Crich, Denby and Horsley Woodhouse, Heage and Ambergate, Heanor and Loscoe, Heanor East, Heanor West, Holbrook and Horsley, Kilburn, Riddings, Ripley, Ripley and Marehay, Shipley Park, Somercotes, Swanwick, and Wingfield, and the Borough of Erewash wards of Breadsall and Morley, Little Eaton, and Stanley.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Borough of Amber Valley wards of Alfreton, Codnor and Waingroves, Heage and Ambergate, Heanor and Loscoe, Heanor East, Heanor West, Ironville and Riddings, Kilburn, Denby and Holbrook, Langley Mill and Aldercar, Ripley, Ripley and Marehay, Shipley Park, Horsley and Horsley Woodhouse, Somercotes, Swanwick, and Wingfield.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nThe Amber Valley constituency is located in the east of [[Derbyshire]], and covers the market and manufacturing towns of [[Alfreton]], [[Heanor]] and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]]; in a majority of [[Amber Valley local elections|council elections]] from 1960 to 2012, these were favourably disposed to the Labour Party. The constituency also contains many rural and suburban wards, which during the same period generally had a majority in support of the Conservatives. The constituency stretches from the edge of the [[Peak District]] to the northern edge of [[Derby]], which forms another set of neighbourhoods more favourably disposed to the Conservatives.\n\nSince 2000 the conservatives have controlled [[Amber Valley|Amber Valley Borough Council]] with the exception of 2014-2015 and again in 2019 when Labour has been in power. Prior to this, the council was held by Labour or under no overall control for all but three years from its formation in 1973.\n\nThe constituency's generally small majorities in recent elections (an exception being the 2017 result) and [[bellwether]] status since 1983 (being won by the party that nationally holds the most parliamentary seats) means Amber Valley is, by most common measures, a [[marginal seat]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|a|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:
