The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the [[Caroline Islands]] in the wider region of [[Micronesia]], which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries. The term ''Micronesia'' may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole.\n\nThe FSM was formerly a part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI), a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory under U.S. administration, but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10, 1979, becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3, 1986, under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Other neighboring island entities, and also former members of the TTPI, formulated their own constitutional governments and became the [[Marshall Islands|Republic of the Marshall Islands]] (RMI) and the [[Palau|Republic of Palau]] (ROP).

A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on [[Yap Island]].[[File:Reception of the Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and [[Caroline Islands|Carolinas]], c. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]]]]\n\n[[Nan Madol]], consisting of a series of small [[artificial island]]s linked by a network of canals, is often called the Venice of the Pacific. It is located on the eastern periphery of the island of Pohnpei and used to be the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people from about [[Anno Domini|AD]] 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed.\n\nEuropean explorers\u2014first the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in search of the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] ([[Indonesia]]) and then the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]\u2014reached the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the [[Spanish East Indies]] through the capital, [[Manila]], and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of ''Santiago de la Ascension'' in what today is [[Kolonia]] on the island of Pohnpei.\n\nFollowing defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the Spanish sold the archipelago to [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1899 under the [[German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany incorporated it into [[German New Guinea]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], it was captured by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Following the war, the [[League of Nations]] awarded a [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]] for Japan to administer the islands as part of the [[South Seas Mandate]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in [[Truk Lagoon]]. In February 1944, [[Operation Hailstone]], one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.\n\nFollowing World War II, it was administered by the [[United States]] under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].\n\nOn May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia. [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] chose not to participate. The FSM signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence. Independence was formally concluded under international law in 1990, when the United Nations officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683|Security Council Resolution 683]]. The Compact was renewed in 2004.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the [[Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia|1979 constitution]], which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. This constitution constructs the national government to be similar to - but not exactly alike - that of the United States. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators\u2014one from each state\u2014serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections.\n\nThe president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties.\n\n===Defense and foreign affairs===\n{{main|Compact of Free Association}}\n\nIn international politics, the Federated States of Micronesia has often voted with the United States with respect to [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly - Overall Votes - Comparison with U.S. vote]  lists Micronesia as in the country with the fourth high coincidence of votes.

A commission of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under [[Pope Leo XIII]] arbitrated a dispute for the [[Caroline Islands]] and others extending from the [[Equator]] to 11\u00b0N [[Latitude]] and from 133\u00b0E to 164\u00b0E [[Longitude]].  [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]] on 17 December 1885 agreed in a [[treaty]] that they were a part of the [[Spanish East Indies]].  In 1899, Spain sold \"las  Carolinas\" to Germany.   Kapingamarangi is far south of the Carolines and the people are racially and culturally [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], not [[Micronesian people|Micronesian]] or [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]].  In 1948, Emilio Pastor Santos of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] found that the charts and maps up to 1899 had shown that Kapingamarangi and a few other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, were not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany and were never [[Cession|ceded]] by Spain; therefore, Spain retained [[sovereignty]].  In 1949, the Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Spanish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued the following declaration:\n<blockquote>\"... The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone.\"</blockquote>\nSuccessive Spanish governments have not abandoned Spain's sovereignty, or insisted on enforcing it, or recognized the sovereignty of the Federated States of Micronesia over Kapingamarangi.<ref>Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberan\u00eda espa\u00f1ola en Ocean\u00eda'', Instituto de Estudios Africanos, CSIC, Madrid, 1950</ref><ref>Weaver, Zay ''Territories under Spanish Sovereignty in Oceania'' (partial translation of Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberan\u00eda espa\u00f1ola en Ocean\u00eda''), Palau Museum, Koror, 1967</ref> The Federated States of Micronesia claims sovereignty and has [[de facto]] control of the island.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Koloniasokehs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A view of Kolonia Town from Sokehs Ridge in [[Pohnpei]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia consists of 607 [[island]]s extending {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} across the [[archipelago]] of the [[Caroline Islands]] east of the [[Philippines]].

A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on [[Yap Island]].[[File:Reception of the Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and [[Caroline Islands|Carolinas]], c. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]]]]\n\n[[Nan Madol]], consisting of a series of small [[artificial island]]s linked by a network of canals, is often called the Venice of the Pacific. It is located on the eastern periphery of the island of Pohnpei and used to be the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people from about [[Anno Domini|AD]] 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed.\n\nEuropean explorers\u2014first the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in search of the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] ([[Indonesia]]) and then the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]\u2014reached the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the [[Spanish East Indies]] through the capital, [[Manila]], and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of ''Santiago de la Ascension'' in what today is [[Kolonia]] on the island of Pohnpei.\n\nFollowing defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the Spanish sold the archipelago to [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1899 under the [[German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany incorporated it into [[German New Guinea]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], it was captured by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Following the war, the [[League of Nations]] awarded a [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]] for Japan to administer the islands as part of the [[South Seas Mandate]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in [[Truk Lagoon]]. In February 1944, [[Operation Hailstone]], one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.\n\nFollowing World War II, it was administered by the [[United States]] under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].\n\nOn May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia. [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] chose not to participate. The FSM signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence.

The Compact was renewed in 2004.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the [[Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia|1979 constitution]], which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. This constitution constructs the national government to be similar to - but not exactly alike - that of the United States. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators\u2014one from each state\u2014serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections.\n\nThe president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties.\n\n===Defense and foreign affairs===\n{{main|Compact of Free Association}}\n\nIn international politics, the Federated States of Micronesia has often voted with the United States with respect to [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly - Overall Votes - Comparison with U.S. vote]  lists Micronesia as in the country with the fourth high coincidence of votes.

A commission of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under [[Pope Leo XIII]] arbitrated a dispute for the [[Caroline Islands]] and others extending from the [[Equator]] to 11\u00b0N [[Latitude]] and from 133\u00b0E to 164\u00b0E [[Longitude]].  [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]] on 17 December 1885 agreed in a [[treaty]] that they were a part of the [[Spanish East Indies]].  In 1899, Spain sold \"las  Carolinas\" to Germany.   Kapingamarangi is far south of the Carolines and the people are racially and culturally [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], not [[Micronesian people|Micronesian]] or [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]].  In 1948, Emilio Pastor Santos of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] found that the charts and maps up to 1899 had shown that Kapingamarangi and a few other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, were not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany and were never [[Cession|ceded]] by Spain; therefore, Spain retained [[sovereignty]].  In 1949, the Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Spanish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued the following declaration:\n<blockquote>\"... The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone.\"</blockquote>\nSuccessive Spanish governments have not abandoned Spain's sovereignty, or insisted on enforcing it, or recognized the sovereignty of the Federated States of Micronesia over Kapingamarangi.<ref>Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberan\u00eda espa\u00f1ola en Ocean\u00eda'', Instituto de Estudios Africanos, CSIC, Madrid, 1950</ref><ref>Weaver, Zay ''Territories under Spanish Sovereignty in Oceania'' (partial translation of Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberan\u00eda espa\u00f1ola en Ocean\u00eda''), Palau Museum, Koror, 1967</ref> The Federated States of Micronesia claims sovereignty and has [[de facto]] control of the island.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Koloniasokehs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A view of Kolonia Town from Sokehs Ridge in [[Pohnpei]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia consists of 607 [[island]]s extending {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} across the [[archipelago]] of the [[Caroline Islands]] east of the [[Philippines]].

By the time is became Forest City, it had been unoccupied, virgin land.\n\n==History==\nThe land that would become Forest City had been known as \"Forest Mills\" since the 1850s.   From 1879-1886, the post office was called \"Pentecost\".  It was named after one of the first local settlers, William Pentecost, who had started the lumbering and milling industries in the area.  The post office was renamed Forest City in 1886, and the Forest City borough was formed in 1888.<ref name=\"susqCtyHist\">{{cite web|title=County Info|url=http://www.susqcohistsoc.org/#!county-information/c1a2c|publisher=Susquehannna County Historical Society|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1866 and 1871, the Jefferson Branch, a railroad spur of the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway#Delaware and Hudson Company (Railroad Corporation)|D & H Canal Company]], was built in Forest Mills.<ref name=\"susqCtyHist\"/> It ran between [[Susquehanna Depot, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna Depot]] and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]], transporting the harvested [[lumber]]. [[Lumber industry|Lumbering]] was the only industry of this area, with the exception of a small mining operation run by William Pentecost, which supplied only sufficient [[coal]] to neighboring farmers for winter fuel.<ref name=cent>{{cite web|title=A Short History of Forest City|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pasusque/history/forestcityhistory.html|accessdate=13 February 2016|quote=compiled from the booklet published for the Forest City Centennial in 1964}}</ref>\n\nIn 1871, an outcropping of coal was discovered. The Hillside Coal and Iron Company bought large tracts of land in the area, and by 1872 the first commercially profitable coal mining enterprise was established at North Railroad Street. A small breaker erected on Railroad Street processed the 75 ton daily output from this operation until 1883.<ref name=cent/>\n\nIn 1886, another shaft, Shaft No. 2, was opened. This brought an influx of miners, mostly Welsh, into the area. There were now 300 men and boys employed in the production of coal.<ref name=cent/>\n\n[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/american-showman/9780231159050 \"The 1922 Breaker #2 collapse\"]\n\nOn April 1, 1916 there was a mine collapse at Shaft #2 that most notably killed 7 Welsh mining-boys between the ages of 6 and 11. This event was the basis for the song [https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/8777 \"Crugybar o frynian caersalem\"] performed by the Wilkes-Barre Quartet in 1922, which commemorates the event, as the boys were \"fresh off the boat\" from the Salem's Hills area of Northeast Wales.\n\nCoal mining continued until The [[Great Depression]] hit this town hard, as [[primary sector of the economy]] products as lumber and coal were hardest hit. The population slowly dwindled as the coal mining came to a halt. Today, the Forest City Area Historical Society serves as a reminder of this once flourishing coal town.<ref name=cent/>\n\nThere are important agricultural interests in the region. At the onset of the twentieth century, coal-mining and silk manufacturing were the chief industries, but with the onset of The Great Depression in the 1920s, businesses decreased to a core of generational store owners.\n\n2017 was a turnaround year for Forest City. In August 2017, a sweeping fire destroyed 25% of the storefronts in town. Then in September, a sudden real estate frenzy bought all lower priced houses in town. Additionally, according to US census records, the highest age percentile decreased below the 35 to 59 age percentile, the first time since 1910. Historically, this signifies the onset of gentrification.\n\n==Geography==\n\nForest City is {{convert|23|mi|km}} north by east of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]].\n\nForest City is located at {{Coord|41|39|3|N|75|28|5|W|type:city}} (41.650907, -75.468180).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} of it (3.23%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 993\n|1880= 990\n|1890= 2319\n|1900= 4279\n|1910= 5749\n|1920= 6004\n|1930= 5209\n|1940= 4266\n|1950= 3122\n|1960= 2651\n|1970= 2322\n|1980= 1924\n|1990= 1846\n|2000= 1855\n|2010= 1911\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1757\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR8\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2011-05-14 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,911 people, 817 households, and 462 families residing in the borough.\n\nThe entire village is only .9034 square miles or 2.33&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nThere are 817 households out of which 28.3% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.6% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.1% have a female householder with no husband present, and 43.5% are non-families. 39.2% of all households are made up of individuals and 23.5% have someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

In its height in the 1920s, Forest City was known as \"the town with the most churches in it\" to the locals.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nUntil recently, Forest City's overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population boasted five churches: St. Anthony, St. Michael, St. Agnes, St. Joseph, and Sacred Heart. Each of these churches were ethnic, St. Agnes being [[Irish American|Irish]], St. Anthony's was [[Lithuania]]n; St. Michael's was [[Slovaks|Slovak]]; St. Joseph's was [[Slovenia]]n; and Sacred Heart was [[Poland|Polish]]. Early consolidations were planned in the 1970s, but public resistance kept some of the buildings intermittently open for decades. The Ascension of Our Lord Parish was created and dedicated in 2010, and the worship site, St. Joseph's Church, was renovated to accommodate the merger.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nForest City is also home to an Episcopal church, a Byzantine Catholic church, and a non-denominational church.  The Methodist Church closed May 2013 and the building was generously donated to the Forest City Area Historical Society which is now society headquarters and museum.\n\n==Senior Care==\n\nThe William Penn apartment complex for seniors is on Main Street and the Forest City Nursing and Rehab Center is on Delaware Street. This represents up to 7% of the population of Forest City.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Economy==\nAlthough Forest City's Main Street houses several business, most residents shop in the larger towns closer to [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania]]. Main Street features a number of [[small business]]es. [[YUM Brands]] put a franchise business in town that thrives as well as a Dollar General and a 24-hour convenience  store.\n\n==Government and Government Services==\nForest City has its own police department which serves some surrounding municipalities on a contractual basis. The police department consists of a Police Chief, Assistant Police Chief and several Patrol Officers. The police department is located on the second floor of Forest City's Boro Hall, which also is the office for town's mayor. Boro Hall also houses the Forest City Library. Up to 5% of the town is wanted by the police.\n\nForest City has two parks: John F. Kennedy Park and Babe Ruth Park. Kennedy Park, located on [[Pennsylvania Route 247]], five blocks from Main Street, has a lake, baseball fields, tennis and basketball courts, [[disc golf|frisbee golf course]], playground, and nature trail. Babe Ruth Park is located on Railroad Street and features a playground, playing field, and a basketball court.\n\nForest City used to hold an annual festival called \"[[Old Home Week]]\u201d Economics, and the donations of the few Forest City businesses has made it unsustainable as a week-long event.\n\nForest City is the starting point to the [[Steamtown Marathon]], which is held the Sunday before Columbus Day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Events - Steamtown Marathon|url=http://www.visitnepa.org/event/steamtown-marathon/|publisher=Lackawanna County Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Forest City Regional School District]] is a Preschool-12th grade public school district serving residents of Forest City.

Historically, this signifies the onset of gentrification.\n\n==Geography==\n\nForest City is {{convert|23|mi|km}} north by east of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]].\n\nForest City is located at {{Coord|41|39|3|N|75|28|5|W|type:city}} (41.650907, -75.468180).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} of it (3.23%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 993\n|1880= 990\n|1890= 2319\n|1900= 4279\n|1910= 5749\n|1920= 6004\n|1930= 5209\n|1940= 4266\n|1950= 3122\n|1960= 2651\n|1970= 2322\n|1980= 1924\n|1990= 1846\n|2000= 1855\n|2010= 1911\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1757\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR8\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2011-05-14 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,911 people, 817 households, and 462 families residing in the borough.\n\nThe entire village is only .9034 square miles or 2.33&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nThere are 817 households out of which 28.3% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.6% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.1% have a female householder with no husband present, and 43.5% are non-families. 39.2% of all households are made up of individuals and 23.5% have someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.23 and the average family size is 2.91.\n\nThe median age is 47. For every 100 females, there are 84.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 78.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough is $33,618, and the median income for a family is $41,985.

About 6.4% of families and 21.3% of the population live below the [[poverty line]], including 28.4% of those under age 18 and 17.4% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Churches==\nDue to the historical influx of immigrants settling in [[primary sector of the economy]] towns such as Forest City, as each successive ethnic minority would build their own church. In its height in the 1920s, Forest City was known as \"the town with the most churches in it\" to the locals.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nUntil recently, Forest City's overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population boasted five churches: St. Anthony, St. Michael, St. Agnes, St. Joseph, and Sacred Heart. Each of these churches were ethnic, St. Agnes being [[Irish American|Irish]], St. Anthony's was [[Lithuania]]n; St. Michael's was [[Slovaks|Slovak]]; St. Joseph's was [[Slovenia]]n; and Sacred Heart was [[Poland|Polish]]. Early consolidations were planned in the 1970s, but public resistance kept some of the buildings intermittently open for decades. The Ascension of Our Lord Parish was created and dedicated in 2010, and the worship site, St. Joseph's Church, was renovated to accommodate the merger.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nForest City is also home to an Episcopal church, a Byzantine Catholic church, and a non-denominational church.  The Methodist Church closed May 2013 and the building was generously donated to the Forest City Area Historical Society which is now society headquarters and museum.\n\n==Senior Care==\n\nThe William Penn apartment complex for seniors is on Main Street and the Forest City Nursing and Rehab Center is on Delaware Street. This represents up to 7% of the population of Forest City.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Economy==\nAlthough Forest City's Main Street houses several business, most residents shop in the larger towns closer to [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania]]. Main Street features a number of [[small business]]es. [[YUM Brands]] put a franchise business in town that thrives as well as a Dollar General and a 24-hour convenience  store.\n\n==Government and Government Services==\nForest City has its own police department which serves some surrounding municipalities on a contractual basis. The police department consists of a Police Chief, Assistant Police Chief and several Patrol Officers. The police department is located on the second floor of Forest City's Boro Hall, which also is the office for town's mayor. Boro Hall also houses the Forest City Library. Up to 5% of the town is wanted by the police.\n\nForest City has two parks: John F. Kennedy Park and Babe Ruth Park. Kennedy Park, located on [[Pennsylvania Route 247]], five blocks from Main Street, has a lake, baseball fields, tennis and basketball courts, [[disc golf|frisbee golf course]], playground, and nature trail. Babe Ruth Park is located on Railroad Street and features a playground, playing field, and a basketball court.\n\nForest City used to hold an annual festival called \"[[Old Home Week]]\u201d Economics, and the donations of the few Forest City businesses has made it unsustainable as a week-long event. \n\nForest City is the starting point to the [[Steamtown Marathon]], which is held the Sunday before Columbus Day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Events - Steamtown Marathon|url=http://www.visitnepa.org/event/steamtown-marathon/|publisher=Lackawanna County Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Forest City Regional School District]] is a Preschool-12th grade public school district serving residents of Forest City.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J.

He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

It is bordered by the [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] (568&nbsp;m) and the [[Gaisberg (Heidelberg)|Gaisberg]] (375&nbsp;m) mountains. The Neckar here flows in an east-west direction. On the right bank of the river, the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] mountain rises to a height of 445 meters. The Neckar flows into the [[Rhine]] approximately 22 kilometres north-west in [[Mannheim]]. Villages incorporated during the 20th century stretch from the Neckar Valley along the Bergstra\u00dfe, a road running along the [[Odenwald]] hills.\n\nHeidelberg is on [[European walking route E1]] ([[Sweden]]-[[Umbria]]).\n[[File:Heidelberg from the K\u00f6nigstuhl.jpg|thumb|Heidelberg seen from [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]]]]\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nSince Heidelberg is among the warmest regions of Germany, plants atypical of the [[Central Europe|central-European]] climate flourish there, including [[almond]] and [[Common fig|fig trees]]; there is also an [[olive tree]] in ''Gaisbergstra\u00dfe''.

The [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]] rural district surrounds it and has its seat in the town, although the town is not a part of the district. Heidelberg is a part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, often referred to as the [[Rhein-Neckar-Triangle|Rhein-Neckar Triangle]].\n\nThis region consists of the southern part of the [[States of Germany|State]] of [[Hessen]], the southern part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (''Vorderpfalz''), the administrative districts of [[Mannheim]] and Heidelberg, and the southern municipalities of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]. The Rhein-Neckar Triangle became a European [[metropolitan area]] in 2005.\n\nHeidelberg consists of 15 districts distributed in six sectors of the town. In the central area are Altstadt (the Old Town), [[Heidelberg-Bergheim|Bergheim]] and Weststadt; in the north, Neuenheim and Handschuhsheim; in the east, [[Heidelberg-Ziegelhausen|Ziegelhausen]] and Schlierbach; in the south, [[Heidelberg-S\u00fcdstadt|S\u00fcdstadt]], Rohrbach, Emmertsgrund, and Boxberg; in the southwest, [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]; in the west, Pfaffengrund, Wieblingen, and a new district, named ''Bahnstadt'', is built on land in Weststadt and Wieblingen. The new district will have approximately 5,000\u20136,000 residents and employment for 7,000. Further new residential space for 10,000-15,000 residents was made available in Patrick Henry Village following the departure of the US Armed Forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heidelberg.de/Konversion,Lde/Startseite+Konversion.html|title=Konversion Heidelberg - Startseite Konversion|website=www.heidelberg.de}}</ref>\n\n===Neighbouring communes===\nThe following towns and [[commune]]s border the city of Heidelberg, beginning in the west and in a clockwise direction: [[Edingen-Neckarhausen]], [[Dossenheim]], [[Schriesheim]], [[Wilhelmsfeld]], [[Sch\u00f6nau (Odenwald)|Sch\u00f6nau]], [[Neckargem\u00fcnd]], [[Bammental]], [[Gaiberg]], [[Leimen (Baden)|Leimen]], [[Sandhausen]], [[Oftersheim]], [[Plankstadt]], [[Eppelheim]] (all part of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]) and [[Mannheim]].\n\n===Climate===\nHeidelberg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), defined by the protected valley between the Pf\u00e4lzerwald and the Odenwald. Year-round, the mild temperatures are determined by maritime air masses coming from the west. In contrast to the nearby [[Upper Rhine Plain]], Heidelberg's position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favour clouding and precipitation. The warmest month is July, the coldest is January. Temperatures often rise beyond {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0}} in [[midsummer]]. According to the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Meteorological Service]], Heidelberg was the warmest place in Germany in 2009.<ref>Mechthild Henneke: ''Wetterextreme in Deutschland 2009''.

His jaw bone was discovered in 1907. Scientific dating determined his remains as the earliest evidence of human life in Europe. In the 5th century BC, a [[Celts|Celtic]] fortress of refuge and place of worship were built on the ''Heiligenberg'', or \"Holy Mountain\". Both places can still be identified. In 40 AD, a fort was built and occupied by the 24th Roman cohort and the 2nd [[Cyrenaican]] cohort (CCG XXIIII and CCH II CYR). The early Byzantine/late Roman Emperor Valentinian I, in 369 AD, built new and maintained older ''[[castra]]'' (permanent camps) and a signal tower on the bank of the [[Neckar]]. They built a wooden bridge based on stone pillars across it. The camp protected the first civilian settlements that developed. The Romans remained until 260 AD, when the camp was conquered by [[Germanic people|Germanic tribes]]. The local administrative center in Roman times was the nearby city of [[Ladenburg|Lopodunum]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n [[File:Carl Blechen 003.jpg|thumb|[[Heidelberg Castle]], here shown in a painting by [[Carl Blechen]], was destroyed by the French during the war of succession of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]]][[File:Heidelberg - panoramio (39).jpg|thumb|View of castle from the Corn Market]] \nModern Heidelberg can trace its beginnings to the fifth century. The village ''Bergheim'' (\"Mountain Home\") is first mentioned for that period in documents dated to 769 AD. ''Bergheim'' now lies in the middle of modern Heidelberg. The people gradually converted to Christianity. In 863 AD, the [[monastery]] of [[St. Michael]] was founded on the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] inside the double rampart of the Celtic fortress. Around 1130, the Neuburg Monastery was founded in the Neckar valley. At the same time, the bishopric of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] extended its influence into the valley, founding [[Sch\u00f6nau Abbey]] in 1142. Modern Heidelberg can trace its roots to this 12th-century monastery. The first reference to Heidelberg can be found in a document in [[Sch\u00f6nau Abbey]] dated to 1196. This is considered to be the town's founding date. In 1155, Heidelberg castle and its neighboring settlement were taken over by the house of [[Hohenstaufen]]. [[Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] became [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Pfalzgraf bei Rhein}}). In 1195, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] passed to the [[House of Welf]] through marriage.In 1214, [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria|Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria]] acquired the Palatinate, as a consequence of which the castle came under his control. By 1303, another castle had been constructed for defense. In 1356, the Counts Palatine were granted far-reaching rights in the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], in addition to becoming [[Prince-elector|Electors]]. In 1386, [[Heidelberg University]] was founded by [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine]].\n\n===Modern history===\nHeidelberg University played a leading part in the era of humanism and the Reformation, and the conflict between Lutheranism and Calvinism, in the 15th and 16th centuries. Heidelberg's library, founded in 1421, is the oldest existing public library in Germany. In April 1518, a few months after proclaiming his 95 Theses, [[Martin Luther]] was received in Heidelberg, to defend them. In 1537, the castle located higher up the mountain was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion. The duke's palace was built at the site of the lower castle. [[File:Belagerung Heidelbergs C-L 205.jpg|thumb|The siege of Heidelberg 1622]]\n[[Elector Frederick III]], sovereign of the [[Electoral Palatinate]] from 1559 to 1576, commissioned the composition of a new Catechism for his territory. While the catechism's introduction credits the \"entire theological faculty here\" (at the [[University of Heidelberg]]) and \"all the superintendents and prominent servants of the church\" for the composition of the catechism, Zacharius Ursinus is commonly regarded as the catechism's principal author. [[Caspar Olevianus]] (1536\u20131587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. [[Johann Sylvan]], [[Adam Neuser]], Johannes Willing, [[Thomas Erastus]], Michael Diller, Johannes Brunner, Tilemann Mumius, Petrus Macheropoeus, Johannes Eisenmenger, [[Immanuel Tremellius]] and [[Pierre Boquin]] are all likely to have contributed to the Catechism in some way. Frederick himself wrote the preface to the Catechism and closely oversaw its composition and publication. Frederick, who was officially Lutheran but had strong Reformed leanings, wanted to even out the religious situation of his highly Lutheran territory within the primarily Catholic [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Council of Trent]] had just concluded with its conclusions and decrees against the Protestant faiths, and the [[Peace of Augsburg]] had only granted toleration for [[Lutheranism]] within the empire where the ruler was Lutheran. One of the aims of the catechism was to counteract the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as Anabaptists and \"strict\" [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] like [[Tilemann Heshusius]] and [[Matthias Flacius]], who were resisting Frederick's Reformed influences, particularly on the matter of Eucharist ([[the Lord's Supper]]). The Catechism-based each of its statements on biblical proof-texts, and Frederick himself would defend it as biblical, not reformed, at the 1566 Diet of Augsburg when he was called to answer to charges of violating the Peace of Augsburg. This was the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], officially called the \u2033Catechism, or Christian Instruction, according to the Usages of the Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate.\u2033\n[[File:2002-04-02 Hauptstra\u00dfe, Heidelberg IMG 0404.jpg|thumb|Main street Heidelberg]]\n\nIn November 1619, the royal crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]]. (He was married to [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], eldest daughter of [[James VI and I]] of Scotland and England, respectively.) Frederick became known as the \"Winter King\", as he reigned for only one winter before the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]] regained the crown by force. His overthrow in 1621 marked the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1622, after a [[Siege of Heidelberg (1622)|siege of two months]], the armies of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], commanded by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], captured the town. Tilly gave the famous ''[[Bibliotheca Palatina]]'' from the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] to the Pope as a present. The Catholic Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach gained control over the Palatinate and the title of Prince-Elector.\n\nIn late 1634, after the Swedish army had conquered Heidelberg, imperialist forces attempted to take back the city. They quickly took the city, but were unable to take the castle. As they prepared to blow up its fortifications with gunpowder the French army arrived, 30,000 men strong, led by [[Urbain de Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9]], who had fought in many battles and participated in the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] (1627\u20131628), and [[Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force]]. They ended the siege and drove off the Catholic forces.<ref>Helfferich, Tryntje, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (Cambridge, 2009), pp. 289\u201390.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hotelritter.jpg|thumb|left|Hotel zum Ritter St. Georg]]\nIn 1648, at the end of the war, Frederick V's son [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]], was able to recover his titles and lands. To strengthen his dynasty, Charles I Louis arranged the marriage of his daughter [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Liselotte]] to [[Philip I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], brother of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], king of France. In 1685, after the death of Charles Louis' son, Elector [[Charles II, Elector Palatine|Charles II]], Louis XIV laid claim to his sister-in-law's inheritance. The Germans rejected the claim, in part because of religious differences between local Protestants and the French Catholics, as the [[Protestant Reformation]] had divided the peoples of Europe. The [[War of the Grand Alliance]] ensued. In 1689, French troops took the town and castle, bringing nearly total destruction to the area in 1693. As a result of the destruction due to repeated French invasions related to the [[War of the Palatinate Succession]] coupled with severe winters, thousands of Protestant German Palatines emigrated from the lower Palatinate in the early 18th century. They fled to other European cities and especially to London (where the refugees were called \"the poor Palatines\"). In sympathy for the Protestants, in 1709\u20131710, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] government arranged transport for nearly 6,000 Palatines to New York. Others were transported to [[Pennsylvania]], and to [[South Carolina]]. They worked their passage and later settled in the English colonies there.\n\nIn 1720, after assigning a major church for exclusively Catholic use, religious conflicts with the mostly Protestant inhabitants of Heidelberg caused the Roman Catholic Prince-Elector [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] to transfer his residence to nearby [[Mannheim]]. The court remained there until the Elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] became [[Rulers of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777 and established his court in [[Munich]]. In 1742 Elector Charles Theodore began rebuilding the Palace. In 1764, a lightning bolt destroyed other palace buildings during reconstruction, causing the work to be discontinued.\n\n===1803 to 1933===\nHeidelberg fell to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] in 1803. [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]], re-founded the university, named \"Ruperto-Carola\" after its two founders. Notable scholars soon earned it a reputation as a \"royal residence of the intellect\". In the 18th century, the town was rebuilt in the Baroque style on the old medieval layout.\n\nIn 1810 the [[French revolution]] refugee Count Charles Graimberg began to preserve the palace [[ruins]] and establish a historical collection. In 1815, the Emperor of [[Austria]], the Emperor of [[Russia]] and the King of [[Prussia]] formed the \"[[Holy Alliance]]\" in Heidelberg. In 1848, the German National Assembly was held there. In 1849, during the Palatinate-Baden rebellion of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolutions]], Heidelberg was the headquarters of a revolutionary army. It was defeated by a Prussian army near Waghaeusel. The city was occupied by Prussian troops until 1850. Between 1920 and 1933, Heidelberg University became a center of notable physicians Czerny, Erb, and Krehl; and humanists Rohde, Weber, and Gandolf.\n\n===Nazism and the World War II-period===\n[[File:Alte Bruecke Heidelberg von Konrad Linck 1788.jpg|thumb|Old Bridge, Konrad Linck, 1788]]\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933\u20131945), Heidelberg was a stronghold of the [[NSDAP]], (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) the strongest party in the elections before 1933 (the NSDAP obtained 30% at the communal elections of 1930<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=209\u201310}})</ref>). The NSDAP received 45.9% of the votes in the [[German federal election, March 1933|German federal election of March 1933]] (the national average was 43.9%).<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=229}})</ref> Non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] university staff were discriminated against. By 1939, one-third of the university's teaching staff had been forced out for racial and political reasons. The non-Aryan professors were ejected in 1933, within one month of Hitler's rise to power. The lists of those to be deported were prepared beforehand.{{vague|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn 1934 and 1935 the ''Reichsarbeitsdienst'' (State Labor Service) and Heidelberg University students built the huge [[Heidelberg_Thingst\u00e4tte|''Thingst\u00e4tte'' amphitheatre]] on the ''Heiligenberg'' north of the town, for [[Nazi Party]] and [[SS]] events. A few months later, the inauguration of the huge Ehrenfriedhof memorial cemetery completed the second and last NSDAP project in Heidelberg. This cemetery is on the southern side of the old part of town, a little south of the [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]] hilltop, and faces west towards France. During World War II and after, [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers were buried there.\n[[File:Heidelberg Old Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|Old Bridge Gate]]]]\n[[File:Heidelberger Synagogenplatz 2.JPG|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the synagogue in the Lauerstrasse]]\nDuring the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on November 9, 1938, Nazis burned down synagogues at two locations in the city. The next day, they started the systematic deportation of Jews, sending 150 to [[Dachau concentration camp]]. On October 22, 1940, during the \"Wagner Buerckel event\", the Nazis deported 6000 local Jews, including 281 from Heidelberg, to [[Camp Gurs]] concentration camp in France. Within a few months, as many as 1000 of them (201 from Heidelberg) died of hunger and disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=246\u20138}}</ref> Among the deportees from Heidelberg, the poet [[Alfred Mombert]] (1872\u20131942) left the camp in April 1941 thanks to the Swiss poet Hans Reinhart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/sammlungen/alte-drucke-und-rara/bestand/nachlassbibliotheken/#c599|title=Alfred Mombert|work=Badische Landesbibliothek|language=German|archivedate=September 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919171757/https://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/sammlungen/alte-drucke-und-rara/bestand/nachlassbibliotheken/#c599}}</ref> From 1942, the deportees who had survived internment in Gurs were deported to Eastern Europe, where most of them were murdered.\n\nOn March 29, 1945, German troops left the city after destroying three arches of the old bridge, Heidelberg's treasured river crossing. They also destroyed the more modern bridge downstream. The U.S. Army ([[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd Infantry]], 7th Army) entered the town on March 30, 1945. The civilian population surrendered without resistance.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Kleine Heidelberger Stadtgeschichte |last=Fink |first=Oliver |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-7917-1971-9 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nA popular belief is that Heidelberg escaped bombing in World War II because the U.S. Army wanted to use the city as a garrison after the war. As Heidelberg was neither an industrial center nor a transport hub, it did not present a target of opportunity. Other notable university towns, such as [[T\u00fcbingen]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]], were spared bombing as well. Allied air raids focused extensively on the nearby industrial cities of [[Mannheim]] and [[Ludwigshafen]].\n\n\nThe U.S. Army may have chosen Heidelberg as a garrison base because of its excellent infrastructure, including the Heidelberg-Mannheim [[Autobahn]] (motorway), which connected to the Mannheim-Darmstadt-Frankfurt Autobahn, and the U.S. Army installations in [[Mannheim]] and [[Frankfurt]]. The intact rail infrastructure was more important in the late 1940s and early 1950s when most heavy loads were still carried by train, not by truck. Heidelberg had the untouched Wehrmacht barracks, the \"Grossdeutschland Kaserne\" which the US Army occupied soon after, renaming it the [[Campbell Barracks]].\n\n===History after 1945===\nIn 1945 the university was reopened relatively quickly on the initiative of a small group of professors, among whom were the anti-Nazi economist [[Alfred Weber]] and the philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Remy|2002|page=240}}</ref> The surgeon Karl Heinrich Bauer was nominated rector.\n\nOn December 9, 1945, US Army General [[George S. Patton]] had a car accident in the adjacent city of [[Mannheim]] and died in the Heidelberg US Army hospital on December 21, 1945. The funeral ceremony was held at the Heidelberg-Weststadt ''Christuskirche'' (Christ Church), and he was buried in the 3rd Army cemetery in [[Luxembourg]].<ref>[[George S. Patton#Accident and death]]</ref>\n\nDuring the post-war [[military occupation]], the [[U.S. Army]] used the ''[[Heidelberg Thingst\u00e4tte|Thingst\u00e4tte]]'' for cultural and religious events. Civilian use started in the early to mid-1980s for occasional concerts and other cultural events. Today, the celebrations on ''Hexennacht'' (\"Witches' Night\"), also called [[Walpurgis Night]]), the night of April 30, are a regular \"underground\" fixture at the ''Thingst\u00e4tte''. Thousands of mostly young people congregate there to drum, to breathe fire, and to juggle. The event has gained fame throughout the region, as well as a certain notoriety due to the amount of litter left behind.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Heidelberg population.svg|thumb|Population growth]]\n\nThe population of the city of Heidelberg exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1946. It is a city with an international population, including one of the largest American communities outside North America, but this is not analysed in the Heidelberg population statistics. At the end of December 2011, the city had 149,633 inhabitants with an official primary residence in Heidelberg (not including the soldiers and employees of the U.S. Army and their dependents, a total of about 20,000 people), a historic high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |publisher=Statistical office of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg |title=Population of city of Heidelberg |accessdate=25 July 2012 |language=German |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207050411/http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe following table shows the number of inhabitants within the boundaries of the city at the time.

The task of the council is to decide with the mayor presiding all the affairs of the city. The council controls the city administration and oversees the enforcement of its decisions.\n\nHeidelberg has always been a stronghold of the Greens. For the municipal elections in 2009, they split into the Green Alternative List and Alliance 90/The Greens and each ran their own lists.

A medieval bridge gate is on the side of the old town, and was originally part of the town wall. Baroque tower helmets were added as part of the erection of the stone bridge in 1788.\n*The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] (''Heiliggeistkirche''), a [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] church in the marketplace of the old town.\n*The Karls\u2018 gate (''Karlstor'') is a triumphal arch in honour of the Prince Elector Karl Theodor, located at Heidelberg's east side. It was built 1775\u20131781 and designed by Nicolas de Pigage.\n*The house ''Zum Ritter Sankt Georg'' (Knight St. George) is one of the few buildings to survive the War of Succession. Standing across from the Church of the Holy Spirit, it was built in the style of the late [[Renaissance]]. It is named after the sculpture at the top.\n*The ''Marstall'' (Stables), a 16th-century building on the Neckar that has served several purposes through its history. It is now a cafeteria for the university.\n\n===Heidelberg Castle===\n{{Main article|Heidelberg Castle}}\n[[File:Plan des Heidelberger Schlosses von Peter Friedrich von Walpergen um 1780.jpg|thumb|Historic map of [[Heidelberg Castle]]]]\n[[File:Heidelberg 17.11.2012 - panoramio (10).jpg|thumb|Heidelberg Castle at night]]\n[[File:Heidelberg Schloss Luftbild 2.JPG|thumb|right|Heidelberg Fortress]]\n[[File:Michaelskloster von Westen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]]]]\n\nThe castle is a mix of styles from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Prince Elector Ruprecht III (1398\u20131410) erected the first building in the inner courtyard as a royal residence. The building was divided into a ground floor made of stone and framework upper levels. Another royal building is located opposite the Ruprecht Building: the Fountain Hall. Prince Elector Philipp (1476\u20131508) is said to have arranged the transfer of the hall's columns from a decayed palace of [[Charlemagne]] from [[Ingelheim]] to Heidelberg.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prince Electors added two palace buildings and turned the fortress into a castle. The two dominant buildings at the eastern and northern side of the courtyard were erected during the rule of Ottheinrich (1556\u20131559) and Friedrich IV (1583\u20131610). Under Friedrich V (1613\u20131619), the main building of the west side was erected, the so-called \"English Building\".\n\nThe castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the Palatine War of Succession. As Prince Elector Karl Theodor tried to restore the castle, lightning struck in 1764, and ended all attempts at rebuilding. Later on, the castle was misused as a quarry; stones from the castle were taken to build new houses in Heidelberg. This was stopped in 1800 by Count Charles de Graimberg, who then began the process of preserving the castle.\n\nAlthough the interior is in Gothic style, the King's Hall was not built until 1934. Today, the hall is used for festivities, e.g. dinner banquets, balls and theatre performances. During the Heidelberg Castle Festival in the summer, the courtyard is the site of open air musicals, operas, theatre performances, and classical concerts performed by the Heidelberg Philharmonics.\n\nThe castle is surrounded by a park, where the famous poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] once walked. The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] [[funicular]] railway runs from Kornmakt to the summit of the K\u00f6nigstuhl via the castle.\n\nThe castle looks over the entire city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schloss-heidelberg.de/en/home/|title=Schloss Heidelberg: Staatliche Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|website=www.schloss-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref>\n\n===Philosophers' Walk===\nOn the northern side of the Neckar is located the Heiligenberg (''Saints' Mountain''), along the side of which runs the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), with scenic views of the old town and castle. Traditionally, Heidelberg's philosophers and university professors would walk and talk along the pathway. Farther up the mountain lie the ruined 11th-century [[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]], the smaller Monastery of St. Stephen, a Nazi-era amphitheater, the so-called Pagan's hole and the remains of an earthen [[Celts|Celtic]] [[hill fort]] from the 4th century BC.\n\n[[File:View on the old Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|700px|center|View from the so-called \"Philosophers' Walk\"\n({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}) towards the Old Town, with [[Heidelberg Castle]], [[Heidelberg Heiliggeist church|Heiliggeist Church]] and the Old Bridge]]\n\n===Heidelberg churches===\n[[File:Heidelberg,_Alte_Br%C3%BCcke,_Heiliggeistkirche_20170601_004.jpg|[[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] tower and old bridge monument|thumb]]\n\nThere are many historical churches in Heidelberg and its surroundings. The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] has been shared over the centuries since the [[Protestant Reformation]] by both Catholics and Protestants. It is one of the few buildings to survive the many wars during the past centuries. It was rebuilt after the French set fire to it in 1709 during the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of the Palatinian Succession]]. The church has remains of the tombs and epitaphs of the past Palatinate electors. This Church stands in the ''Marktplatz'' next to the seat of local government. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town's Protestants as a result of giving the Church of the Holy Spirit exclusively to the Catholics for their use. It had previously been split by a partition and used by both congregations. Due to pressure by the mostly Protestant powers of Prussia, Holland, and Sweden, Prince Karl III Philip gave way and repartitioned the church for joint use. In 1936 the separating wall was removed. The church is now exclusively used by Protestants. Furthermore, there is the Catholic Church of the Jesuits. Its construction began in 1712. It was completed with the addition of a bell tower from 1866\u20131872. The church is also home to the Museum f\u00fcr sakrale Kunst und Liturgie (Museum of [[Ecclesiastical]] Arts). The oldest church in Heidelberg is the St. Peter's Church (now [[Lutheran]]). It was built some time during the 12th century.\n\n==Education==\n===Universities and academia===\n{{Main article|Heidelberg University|List of Heidelberg University people}}\n\n[[File:Heidelberg Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|The university library]]\n\nHeidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The most famous of those is [[Heidelberg University]] Founded in 1386, it is one of Europe's oldest institutions. In fact, Heidelberg is the oldest [[college town|university town]] of today's Germany. Among the prominent thinkers associated with the institution are [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Karl-Otto Apel]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. The campus is situated in two urban areas and several buildings. In numerous historical buildings in the old town there are the Faculties of the [[Humanities]], the [[Social Science]] and the Faculty of [[Jurisprudence|Law]]. The school of applied sciences is located in the ''Science Tower'' in Wieblingen. The Faculties of Medicine and [[Natural Science]] are settled on the Neuenheimer Feld Campus.\n\nThe campus of Heidelberg University has a total undergraduate enrollment of 30,898 as of 2014. The enrollment rate of this university is 16.3 percent. Less than 20 percent of the total student body is international. The main study area for international students is business. This university has many areas of study for national students such as; theology, law, philosophy, modern languages, economics, and social sciences. The university does not charge students for tuition. The school's academic calendar is semester based, and the majority of the language for instruction is in German. For international students the academic calendar is based on a block schedule. The international students attend in block periods of 5 weeks. The University or \"Uni\" is spread across three campuses each containing different fields of study.\n[[File:Heidlbergaula.JPG|thumb|left|Old university hall]]\nSince 1904 there has been a College of Educational Science, the ''P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Heidelberg''; since 1979 there has been a college of Jewish Studies, the ''[[Hochschule f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien Heidelberg]]''. It comprises nine branches specializing in both religion and [[Judaism|Jewish culture]]. The [[Schiller International University]], a private American university is also represented with a campus in Heidelberg offering several undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of International Business and International Relations and Diplomacy.\n\n===Research===\n[[File:EMBL campus Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings of [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in Heidelberg, including the new Advanced Training Centre]]\n\nIn addition to the research centers and institutes of the university, there are numerous research institutions situated in the city of Heidelberg. Among them are the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]], [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]], [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]], [[Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law]].\n\n===Schools===\n[[File:Fachhochschule Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|left|SRH Hochschule Heidelberg is one of the oldest and largest private universities in Germany]]\n\nHeidelberg is home to 23 elementary schools. There are several institutions of secondary education, both public and private, representing all levels of the [[German school system]]. There are 14 [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, with six of them private. With 52% of secondary students attending a Gymnasium, Heidelberg sits above the German average, perhaps because a large number of academics live in Heidelberg and its environs. \n\nThe gymnasiums include the {{ill|Kurf\u00fcrst-Friedrich-Gymnasium|de|Kurf\u00fcrst-Friedrich-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, {{ill|Bunsen-Gymnasium|de|Bunsen-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, [[Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg|Helmholtz-Gymnasium]], H\u00f6lderlin-Gymnasium and Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule. Then there are seven [[Realschule]], ten [[Hauptschule]] and nine [[vocational school]]s (the so-called ''[[Berufsschule]]''). In addition, there are several [[folk high schools]] with different specialisations.<ref>[http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044135/http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Heidelberg International School]] serves the local expatriate community.\n\n==Economy==\n===Tourism===\nIn 2004, 81.8% of people worked for service industries, including tourism. As a relic of the period of Romanticism, Heidelberg has been labeled a \"Romantic town\". This is used to attract more than 3.5 million visitors every year. Many events are organized to attract visitors. One of the biggest tourist attractions is the Christmas market during the winter time.\n\n===Industry===\nOnly 18% of employment is provided by industry. Printing and publishing are important enterprises; nearby [[Walldorf]] is a center of the IT industry and [[SAP SE|SAP]] World Headquarters. Noted pen manufacturer [[Lamy]] has its headquarters and factory in Heidelberg-Wieblingen. [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]] has its headquarters here; its factory is located in Walldorf. Soft-drink company Wild-Werke, manufacturer of the [[Capri-Sonne]] ([[Capri-Sun]] in the U.S.) is located nearby in Eppelheim. Heidelberg is also home to the headquarters of [[HeidelbergCement]], the world's second largest cement producer. The company has its roots in the suburb of Leimen where one of its cement plants is still located. With its long Hauptstrasse, Heidelberg is a shopping destination for people from the surrounding smaller towns.\n[[File:Heidelberger Druckmaschinen.jpg|thumb|right|Print Media Academy]]\n\n===Roads===\nThe [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5 autobahn]] runs through the western outskirts of Heidelberg, connecting the region to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the north and [[Karlsruhe]] to the south. The [[Bundesautobahn 656|A 656]] commences just west of the city, connecting Heidelberg with [[Mannheim]]. Both highways meet at Heidelberg autobahn intersection in the city of Heidelberg, and the A 656 connects to the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] at the Mannheim autobahn intersection, which connects to the east towards [[Stuttgart]].\n\nFurthermore, the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 3|B 3]] (Frankfurt\u2013Karlsruhe) runs north\u2013south through the town, and the B 37 (Mannheim\u2013[[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]]) runs east\u2013west. Both meet in the city center at the Bismarckplatz. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 535|B 535]] begin in the south of Heidelberg and runs to Schwetzingen.\n\n====Tourist roads====\nHeidelberg is located on four tourist roads: [[Bergstra\u00dfe Route|Bergstra\u00dfe]], [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], [[Castle Road]], and Stra\u00dfe der Demokratie (Road of Democracy).\n\n===Railways===\n[[Heidelberg Central Station]] (Hauptbahnhof) is on the [[Rhine Valley Railway]] and is served by [[Intercity-Express]], [[EuroCity in Germany|Euro City]] trains. This station is served by the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]]. There is also a station for [[intercity bus service]]s outside the central station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/heidelberg|title=Heidelberg: Stations|publisher= Travelinho}}</ref>\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:Heidelberg - EC - 2018-07-20 12-36-59.jpg|thumb|DB train [[Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nThe main transport hub of Heidelberg is the Bismarckplatz. Several main thoroughfares of the city intersect here and one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe, the Hauptstra\u00dfe (main street) runs from here through the entire old town of Heidelberg. Heidelberg Central Station was nearby for many years, which was a combined terminal and through station. In 1955, it was moved about 1.5&nbsp;km further to the west, which removed the necessity for trains continuing to the south or from the south to the north to reverse. The new central station became the second major transport hub of Heidelberg.\n\nHeidelberg has had a public transport service since 1883, when horse-drawn trams were established. Due to the rapidly rising patronage it was decided on 20 December 1901 to convert the [[Trams in Heidelberg|Heidelberg tramway network]] to electrical operation. On 16 March 1902, the first electric tram ran on Rohrbacher Stra\u00dfe, sharing use of the suburban tracks built by the ''Deutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'' in 1901 between Heidelberg and [[Wiesloch]]. Until the 1950s, the tram network was expanded a bit at a time. The rapidly growing popularity of car transport presented the operator of the trams with increasingly difficult problems and the tram network was gradually dismantled. It was not until 10 December 2006 that the network was extended again with the opening of a new tram line from [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]. Tram and bus services are now operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (RNV). Since 1989, all fares are set under a uniform scheme by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). [[Carsharing]] increasingly provides a complement to public transport. More than 50 car-sharing stations are available to users in 12 of the 14 districts of Heidelberg offering a total of more than 100 cars.\n[[File:Heidelberg - Bombardier RNV6 - RNV 4144 und RNV 4140 - 2016-08-25 14-39-04.jpg|thumb|Trams in Heidelberg]]\n\nSince 14 December 2003, Heidelberg has been connected to the network of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]], which opens up the entire Rhine-Neckar region, with lines connecting with the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], the [[Saarland]] and southern [[Hesse]].\n\nThe [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] (Heidelberg Mountain Railway) has run since 2005 with new cars on the lower part from Kornmarkt to Molkenkur and historic cars built in 1907 on the upper section of the [[funicular]] from Molkenkur to [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]]. It is one of the most popular means to reach [[Heidelberg Castle]]. The first plans for the funicular were drawn up in 1873. Due to a lack of funds was the first section of the funicular was not opened until 1890. In 2004, the upper section of the funicular was listed as part of the heritage of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n===United States military installations===\n{{see also|United States Army Garrison Heidelberg}}\n[[File:Behoerdenzentrum Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Beh\u00f6rdenzentrum Heidelberg]]\nDuring World War II, Heidelberg was one of the few major cities in Germany not significantly damaged by Allied bombing. Situated in the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone]] of Germany, Heidelberg became the headquarters of the American forces in Europe. The main military facilities were [[Campbell Barracks]], the former Wehrmacht Grossdeutschland-Kaserne, which housed the US Army, Europe ([[USAREUR]]) and [[NATO]]'s Component Command-Land Headquarters. (Until 2004, this was designated Joint Headquarters Centre, and before that, LANDCENT).\n\nCampbell Barracks and [[Mark Twain Village]] were both in S\u00fcdstadt; Patton Barracks was in nearby Kirchheim. Nachrichten Kaserne in Rohrbach was home to the former Heidelberg Army Hospital, later designated the Heidelberg Health Center. [[Patrick Henry Village]], the largest U.S. military housing area in the Heidelberg area, was west of Kirchheim. These installations, including Tompkins Barracks and Kilbourne Kaserne in nearby Schwetzingen, plus the Germersheim Depot, made up the U.S. Army Garrison Heidelberg. Tompkins Barracks was home to [http://www.imcom-europe.army.mil U.S. Army Installation Management Command Europe Region.] The Heidelberg U.S. Army Air Field (Heidelberg AAF) was converted to a<s>n</s> heliport (mostly Blackhawk Helicopters) after the [[NATO]] [[Kosovo]] campaign.\n[[File:Heidelberg Bahnstadt Langer Anger 2.JPG|thumb|left|The New city district of Heidelberg, [[Bahnstadt]], is one of the biggest [[passive house]] settlements in the world]]\nThe children of [[United States Department of Defense]] employees based in Heidelberg attended on-base schools operated by the DODDS-E (Department of Defense Dependents Schools&nbsp;\u2013 Europe).

The phase after [[Jena Romanticism]] is often called '''Heidelberg Romanticism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (see also [[Berlin Romanticism]]). There was a famous circle of poets (the '''Heidelberg Romantics'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->), such as [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Johann Joseph von G\u00f6rres]], [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]], and [[Clemens Brentano]]. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.\n\nThe ''Romantik'' epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.\n\n===Old Heidelberg===\n{{Further information|Alt Heidelberg (play)}}\nIn 1901 [[Wilhelm Meyer-F\u00f6rster]] wrote the play ''[[Old Heidelberg (play)|Old Heidelberg]]'' which was followed by a large number of film adaptations.

It is bordered by the [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] (568&nbsp;m) and the [[Gaisberg (Heidelberg)|Gaisberg]] (375&nbsp;m) mountains. The Neckar here flows in an east-west direction. On the right bank of the river, the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] mountain rises to a height of 445 meters. The Neckar flows into the [[Rhine]] approximately 22 kilometres north-west in [[Mannheim]]. Villages incorporated during the 20th century stretch from the Neckar Valley along the Bergstra\u00dfe, a road running along the [[Odenwald]] hills.\n\nHeidelberg is on [[European walking route E1]] ([[Sweden]]-[[Umbria]]).\n[[File:Heidelberg from the K\u00f6nigstuhl.jpg|thumb|Heidelberg seen from [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]]]]\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nSince Heidelberg is among the warmest regions of Germany, plants atypical of the [[Central Europe|central-European]] climate flourish there, including [[almond]] and [[Common fig|fig trees]]; there is also an [[olive tree]] in ''Gaisbergstra\u00dfe''.

The [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]] rural district surrounds it and has its seat in the town, although the town is not a part of the district. Heidelberg is a part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, often referred to as the [[Rhein-Neckar-Triangle|Rhein-Neckar Triangle]].\n\nThis region consists of the southern part of the [[States of Germany|State]] of [[Hessen]], the southern part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (''Vorderpfalz''), the administrative districts of [[Mannheim]] and Heidelberg, and the southern municipalities of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]. The Rhein-Neckar Triangle became a European [[metropolitan area]] in 2005.\n\nHeidelberg consists of 15 districts distributed in six sectors of the town. In the central area are Altstadt (the Old Town), [[Heidelberg-Bergheim|Bergheim]] and Weststadt; in the north, Neuenheim and Handschuhsheim; in the east, [[Heidelberg-Ziegelhausen|Ziegelhausen]] and Schlierbach; in the south, [[Heidelberg-S\u00fcdstadt|S\u00fcdstadt]], Rohrbach, Emmertsgrund, and Boxberg; in the southwest, [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]; in the west, Pfaffengrund, Wieblingen, and a new district, named ''Bahnstadt'', is built on land in Weststadt and Wieblingen. The new district will have approximately 5,000\u20136,000 residents and employment for 7,000. Further new residential space for 10,000-15,000 residents was made available in Patrick Henry Village following the departure of the US Armed Forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heidelberg.de/Konversion,Lde/Startseite+Konversion.html|title=Konversion Heidelberg - Startseite Konversion|website=www.heidelberg.de}}</ref>\n\n===Neighbouring communes===\nThe following towns and [[commune]]s border the city of Heidelberg, beginning in the west and in a clockwise direction: [[Edingen-Neckarhausen]], [[Dossenheim]], [[Schriesheim]], [[Wilhelmsfeld]], [[Sch\u00f6nau (Odenwald)|Sch\u00f6nau]], [[Neckargem\u00fcnd]], [[Bammental]], [[Gaiberg]], [[Leimen (Baden)|Leimen]], [[Sandhausen]], [[Oftersheim]], [[Plankstadt]], [[Eppelheim]] (all part of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]) and [[Mannheim]].\n\n===Climate===\nHeidelberg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), defined by the protected valley between the Pf\u00e4lzerwald and the Odenwald. Year-round, the mild temperatures are determined by maritime air masses coming from the west. In contrast to the nearby [[Upper Rhine Plain]], Heidelberg's position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favour clouding and precipitation. The warmest month is July, the coldest is January. Temperatures often rise beyond {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0}} in [[midsummer]].

His jaw bone was discovered in 1907. Scientific dating determined his remains as the earliest evidence of human life in Europe. In the 5th century BC, a [[Celts|Celtic]] fortress of refuge and place of worship were built on the ''Heiligenberg'', or \"Holy Mountain\". Both places can still be identified. In 40 AD, a fort was built and occupied by the 24th Roman cohort and the 2nd [[Cyrenaican]] cohort (CCG XXIIII and CCH II CYR). The early Byzantine/late Roman Emperor Valentinian I, in 369 AD, built new and maintained older ''[[castra]]'' (permanent camps) and a signal tower on the bank of the [[Neckar]]. They built a wooden bridge based on stone pillars across it. The camp protected the first civilian settlements that developed. The Romans remained until 260 AD, when the camp was conquered by [[Germanic people|Germanic tribes]]. The local administrative center in Roman times was the nearby city of [[Ladenburg|Lopodunum]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n [[File:Carl Blechen 003.jpg|thumb|[[Heidelberg Castle]], here shown in a painting by [[Carl Blechen]], was destroyed by the French during the war of succession of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]]][[File:Heidelberg - panoramio (39).jpg|thumb|View of castle from the Corn Market]] \nModern Heidelberg can trace its beginnings to the fifth century. The village ''Bergheim'' (\"Mountain Home\") is first mentioned for that period in documents dated to 769 AD. ''Bergheim'' now lies in the middle of modern Heidelberg. The people gradually converted to Christianity. In 863 AD, the [[monastery]] of [[St. Michael]] was founded on the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] inside the double rampart of the Celtic fortress. Around 1130, the Neuburg Monastery was founded in the Neckar valley. At the same time, the bishopric of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] extended its influence into the valley, founding [[Sch\u00f6nau Abbey]] in 1142. Modern Heidelberg can trace its roots to this 12th-century monastery. The first reference to Heidelberg can be found in a document in [[Sch\u00f6nau Abbey]] dated to 1196. This is considered to be the town's founding date. In 1155, Heidelberg castle and its neighboring settlement were taken over by the house of [[Hohenstaufen]]. [[Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] became [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Pfalzgraf bei Rhein}}). In 1195, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] passed to the [[House of Welf]] through marriage.In 1214, [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria|Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria]] acquired the Palatinate, as a consequence of which the castle came under his control. By 1303, another castle had been constructed for defense. In 1356, the Counts Palatine were granted far-reaching rights in the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], in addition to becoming [[Prince-elector|Electors]]. In 1386, [[Heidelberg University]] was founded by [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine]].\n\n===Modern history===\nHeidelberg University played a leading part in the era of humanism and the Reformation, and the conflict between Lutheranism and Calvinism, in the 15th and 16th centuries. Heidelberg's library, founded in 1421, is the oldest existing public library in Germany. In April 1518, a few months after proclaiming his 95 Theses, [[Martin Luther]] was received in Heidelberg, to defend them. In 1537, the castle located higher up the mountain was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion. The duke's palace was built at the site of the lower castle. [[File:Belagerung Heidelbergs C-L 205.jpg|thumb|The siege of Heidelberg 1622]]\n[[Elector Frederick III]], sovereign of the [[Electoral Palatinate]] from 1559 to 1576, commissioned the composition of a new Catechism for his territory. While the catechism's introduction credits the \"entire theological faculty here\" (at the [[University of Heidelberg]]) and \"all the superintendents and prominent servants of the church\" for the composition of the catechism, Zacharius Ursinus is commonly regarded as the catechism's principal author. [[Caspar Olevianus]] (1536\u20131587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. [[Johann Sylvan]], [[Adam Neuser]], Johannes Willing, [[Thomas Erastus]], Michael Diller, Johannes Brunner, Tilemann Mumius, Petrus Macheropoeus, Johannes Eisenmenger, [[Immanuel Tremellius]] and [[Pierre Boquin]] are all likely to have contributed to the Catechism in some way. Frederick himself wrote the preface to the Catechism and closely oversaw its composition and publication. Frederick, who was officially Lutheran but had strong Reformed leanings, wanted to even out the religious situation of his highly Lutheran territory within the primarily Catholic [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Council of Trent]] had just concluded with its conclusions and decrees against the Protestant faiths, and the [[Peace of Augsburg]] had only granted toleration for [[Lutheranism]] within the empire where the ruler was Lutheran. One of the aims of the catechism was to counteract the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as Anabaptists and \"strict\" [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] like [[Tilemann Heshusius]] and [[Matthias Flacius]], who were resisting Frederick's Reformed influences, particularly on the matter of Eucharist ([[the Lord's Supper]]). The Catechism-based each of its statements on biblical proof-texts, and Frederick himself would defend it as biblical, not reformed, at the 1566 Diet of Augsburg when he was called to answer to charges of violating the Peace of Augsburg. This was the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], officially called the \u2033Catechism, or Christian Instruction, according to the Usages of the Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate.\u2033\n[[File:2002-04-02 Hauptstra\u00dfe, Heidelberg IMG 0404.jpg|thumb|Main street Heidelberg]]\n\nIn November 1619, the royal crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]]. (He was married to [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], eldest daughter of [[James VI and I]] of Scotland and England, respectively.) Frederick became known as the \"Winter King\", as he reigned for only one winter before the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]] regained the crown by force. His overthrow in 1621 marked the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1622, after a [[Siege of Heidelberg (1622)|siege of two months]], the armies of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], commanded by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], captured the town. Tilly gave the famous ''[[Bibliotheca Palatina]]'' from the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] to the Pope as a present. The Catholic Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach gained control over the Palatinate and the title of Prince-Elector.\n\nIn late 1634, after the Swedish army had conquered Heidelberg, imperialist forces attempted to take back the city. They quickly took the city, but were unable to take the castle. As they prepared to blow up its fortifications with gunpowder the French army arrived, 30,000 men strong, led by [[Urbain de Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9]], who had fought in many battles and participated in the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] (1627\u20131628), and [[Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force]]. They ended the siege and drove off the Catholic forces.<ref>Helfferich, Tryntje, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (Cambridge, 2009), pp. 289\u201390.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hotelritter.jpg|thumb|left|Hotel zum Ritter St. Georg]]\nIn 1648, at the end of the war, Frederick V's son [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]], was able to recover his titles and lands. To strengthen his dynasty, Charles I Louis arranged the marriage of his daughter [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Liselotte]] to [[Philip I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], brother of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], king of France. In 1685, after the death of Charles Louis' son, Elector [[Charles II, Elector Palatine|Charles II]], Louis XIV laid claim to his sister-in-law's inheritance. The Germans rejected the claim, in part because of religious differences between local Protestants and the French Catholics, as the [[Protestant Reformation]] had divided the peoples of Europe. The [[War of the Grand Alliance]] ensued. In 1689, French troops took the town and castle, bringing nearly total destruction to the area in 1693. As a result of the destruction due to repeated French invasions related to the [[War of the Palatinate Succession]] coupled with severe winters, thousands of Protestant German Palatines emigrated from the lower Palatinate in the early 18th century. They fled to other European cities and especially to London (where the refugees were called \"the poor Palatines\"). In sympathy for the Protestants, in 1709\u20131710, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] government arranged transport for nearly 6,000 Palatines to New York. Others were transported to [[Pennsylvania]], and to [[South Carolina]]. They worked their passage and later settled in the English colonies there.\n\nIn 1720, after assigning a major church for exclusively Catholic use, religious conflicts with the mostly Protestant inhabitants of Heidelberg caused the Roman Catholic Prince-Elector [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] to transfer his residence to nearby [[Mannheim]]. The court remained there until the Elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] became [[Rulers of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777 and established his court in [[Munich]]. In 1742 Elector Charles Theodore began rebuilding the Palace. In 1764, a lightning bolt destroyed other palace buildings during reconstruction, causing the work to be discontinued.\n\n===1803 to 1933===\nHeidelberg fell to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] in 1803. [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]], re-founded the university, named \"Ruperto-Carola\" after its two founders. Notable scholars soon earned it a reputation as a \"royal residence of the intellect\". In the 18th century, the town was rebuilt in the Baroque style on the old medieval layout.\n\nIn 1810 the [[French revolution]] refugee Count Charles Graimberg began to preserve the palace [[ruins]] and establish a historical collection. In 1815, the Emperor of [[Austria]], the Emperor of [[Russia]] and the King of [[Prussia]] formed the \"[[Holy Alliance]]\" in Heidelberg. In 1848, the German National Assembly was held there. In 1849, during the Palatinate-Baden rebellion of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolutions]], Heidelberg was the headquarters of a revolutionary army. It was defeated by a Prussian army near Waghaeusel. The city was occupied by Prussian troops until 1850. Between 1920 and 1933, Heidelberg University became a center of notable physicians Czerny, Erb, and Krehl; and humanists Rohde, Weber, and Gandolf.\n\n===Nazism and the World War II-period===\n[[File:Alte Bruecke Heidelberg von Konrad Linck 1788.jpg|thumb|Old Bridge, Konrad Linck, 1788]]\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933\u20131945), Heidelberg was a stronghold of the [[NSDAP]], (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) the strongest party in the elections before 1933 (the NSDAP obtained 30% at the communal elections of 1930<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=209\u201310}})</ref>). The NSDAP received 45.9% of the votes in the [[German federal election, March 1933|German federal election of March 1933]] (the national average was 43.9%).<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=229}})</ref> Non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] university staff were discriminated against. By 1939, one-third of the university's teaching staff had been forced out for racial and political reasons. The non-Aryan professors were ejected in 1933, within one month of Hitler's rise to power. The lists of those to be deported were prepared beforehand.{{vague|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn 1934 and 1935 the ''Reichsarbeitsdienst'' (State Labor Service) and Heidelberg University students built the huge [[Heidelberg_Thingst\u00e4tte|''Thingst\u00e4tte'' amphitheatre]] on the ''Heiligenberg'' north of the town, for [[Nazi Party]] and [[SS]] events. A few months later, the inauguration of the huge Ehrenfriedhof memorial cemetery completed the second and last NSDAP project in Heidelberg. This cemetery is on the southern side of the old part of town, a little south of the [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]] hilltop, and faces west towards France. During World War II and after, [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers were buried there.\n[[File:Heidelberg Old Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|Old Bridge Gate]]]]\n[[File:Heidelberger Synagogenplatz 2.JPG|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the synagogue in the Lauerstrasse]]\nDuring the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on November 9, 1938, Nazis burned down synagogues at two locations in the city. The next day, they started the systematic deportation of Jews, sending 150 to [[Dachau concentration camp]]. On October 22, 1940, during the \"Wagner Buerckel event\", the Nazis deported 6000 local Jews, including 281 from Heidelberg, to [[Camp Gurs]] concentration camp in France. Within a few months, as many as 1000 of them (201 from Heidelberg) died of hunger and disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=246\u20138}}</ref> Among the deportees from Heidelberg, the poet [[Alfred Mombert]] (1872\u20131942) left the camp in April 1941 thanks to the Swiss poet Hans Reinhart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/sammlungen/alte-drucke-und-rara/bestand/nachlassbibliotheken/#c599|title=Alfred Mombert|work=Badische Landesbibliothek|language=German|archivedate=September 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919171757/https://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/sammlungen/alte-drucke-und-rara/bestand/nachlassbibliotheken/#c599}}</ref> From 1942, the deportees who had survived internment in Gurs were deported to Eastern Europe, where most of them were murdered.\n\nOn March 29, 1945, German troops left the city after destroying three arches of the old bridge, Heidelberg's treasured river crossing. They also destroyed the more modern bridge downstream. The U.S. Army ([[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd Infantry]], 7th Army) entered the town on March 30, 1945. The civilian population surrendered without resistance.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Kleine Heidelberger Stadtgeschichte |last=Fink |first=Oliver |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-7917-1971-9 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nA popular belief is that Heidelberg escaped bombing in World War II because the U.S. Army wanted to use the city as a garrison after the war. As Heidelberg was neither an industrial center nor a transport hub, it did not present a target of opportunity. Other notable university towns, such as [[T\u00fcbingen]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]], were spared bombing as well. Allied air raids focused extensively on the nearby industrial cities of [[Mannheim]] and [[Ludwigshafen]].\n\n\nThe U.S. Army may have chosen Heidelberg as a garrison base because of its excellent infrastructure, including the Heidelberg-Mannheim [[Autobahn]] (motorway), which connected to the Mannheim-Darmstadt-Frankfurt Autobahn, and the U.S. Army installations in [[Mannheim]] and [[Frankfurt]]. The intact rail infrastructure was more important in the late 1940s and early 1950s when most heavy loads were still carried by train, not by truck. Heidelberg had the untouched Wehrmacht barracks, the \"Grossdeutschland Kaserne\" which the US Army occupied soon after, renaming it the [[Campbell Barracks]].\n\n===History after 1945===\nIn 1945 the university was reopened relatively quickly on the initiative of a small group of professors, among whom were the anti-Nazi economist [[Alfred Weber]] and the philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Remy|2002|page=240}}</ref> The surgeon Karl Heinrich Bauer was nominated rector.\n\nOn December 9, 1945, US Army General [[George S. Patton]] had a car accident in the adjacent city of [[Mannheim]] and died in the Heidelberg US Army hospital on December 21, 1945. The funeral ceremony was held at the Heidelberg-Weststadt ''Christuskirche'' (Christ Church), and he was buried in the 3rd Army cemetery in [[Luxembourg]].<ref>[[George S. Patton#Accident and death]]</ref>\n\nDuring the post-war [[military occupation]], the [[U.S. Army]] used the ''[[Heidelberg Thingst\u00e4tte|Thingsst\u00e4tte]]'' for cultural and religious events. Civilian use started in the early to mid-1980s for occasional concerts and other cultural events. Today, the celebrations on ''Hexennacht'' (\"Witches' Night\"), also called [[Walpurgis Night]]), the night of April 30, are a regular \"underground\" fixture at the ''Thingst\u00e4tte''. Thousands of mostly young people congregate there to drum, to breathe fire, and to juggle. The event has gained fame throughout the region, as well as a certain notoriety due to the amount of litter left behind.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Heidelberg population.svg|thumb|Population growth]]\n\nThe population of the city of Heidelberg exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1946. It is a city with an international population, including one of the largest American communities outside North America, but this is not analysed in the Heidelberg population statistics. At the end of December 2011, the city had 149,633 inhabitants with an official primary residence in Heidelberg (not including the soldiers and employees of the U.S. Army and their dependents, a total of about 20,000 people), a historic high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |publisher=Statistical office of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg |title=Population of city of Heidelberg |accessdate=25 July 2012 |language=German |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207050411/http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe following table shows the number of inhabitants within the boundaries of the city at the time.

The task of the council is to decide with the mayor presiding all the affairs of the city. The council controls the city administration and oversees the enforcement of its decisions.\n\nHeidelberg has always been a stronghold of the Greens. For the municipal elections in 2009, they split into the Green Alternative List and Alliance 90/The Greens and each ran their own lists. Together they gained 10 seats to become the strongest force for the first time.\n\nAfter the election, the deputies of the Alliance 90/The Greens formed a coalition with generation.HD.\nIn September 2011 two members of the GAL Group joined the Alliance 90/The Greens, so now with generation.HD, they form the largest group on the council.\n\n==Cityscape==\n===The old town===\n[[File:2002-04-02 Heidelberger Rathaus IMG 0388.jpg|thumb|right|The marketplace, with Town Hall on the right]][[File:Heidelberg - aus dem Schloss 1.jpg|thumb|right|Heidelberg's old city centre from the castle above]][[File:Deutschland Heidelberg Schloss.JPG|thumb|Heidelberg Castle with the Old Bridge in foreground, 2010]][[File:Heidelberg winter.jpg|thumb|right|View from the castle during winter, 2014]]\n\nThe \"old town\" ({{lang-de|link=no|Altstadt}}), on the south bank of the Neckar, is long and narrow. It is dominated by the ruins of [[Heidelberg Castle]], 80 metres above the Neckar on the steep wooded slopes of the [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]] (''King's chair or throne'') hill.\n*The Main Street (''Hauptstrasse''), a mile-long pedestrian street, running the length of the old town.\n*The [[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|old stone bridge]] was erected 1786\u20131788. A medieval bridge gate is on the side of the old town, and was originally part of the town wall. Baroque tower helmets were added as part of the erection of the stone bridge in 1788.\n*The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] (''Heiliggeistkirche''), a [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] church in the marketplace of the old town.\n*The Karls\u2018 gate (''Karlstor'') is a triumphal arch in honour of the Prince Elector Karl Theodor, located at Heidelberg's east side. It was built 1775\u20131781 and designed by Nicolas de Pigage.\n*The house ''Zum Ritter Sankt Georg'' (Knight St. George) is one of the few buildings to survive the War of Succession. Standing across from the Church of the Holy Spirit, it was built in the style of the late [[Renaissance]]. It is named after the sculpture at the top.\n*The ''Marstall'' (Stables), a 16th-century building on the Neckar that has served several purposes through its history. It is now a cafeteria for the university.\n\n===Heidelberg Castle===\n{{Main article|Heidelberg Castle}}\n[[File:Plan des Heidelberger Schlosses von Peter Friedrich von Walpergen um 1780.jpg|thumb|Historic map of [[Heidelberg Castle]]]]\n[[File:Heidelberg 17.11.2012 - panoramio (10).jpg|thumb|Heidelberg Castle at night]]\n[[File:Heidelberg Schloss Luftbild 2.JPG|thumb|right|Heidelberg Fortress]]\n[[File:Michaelskloster von Westen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]]]]\n\nThe castle is a mix of styles from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Prince Elector Ruprecht III (1398\u20131410) erected the first building in the inner courtyard as a royal residence. The building was divided into a ground floor made of stone and framework upper levels. Another royal building is located opposite the Ruprecht Building: the Fountain Hall. Prince Elector Philipp (1476\u20131508) is said to have arranged the transfer of the hall's columns from a decayed palace of [[Charlemagne]] from [[Ingelheim]] to Heidelberg.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prince Electors added two palace buildings and turned the fortress into a castle. The two dominant buildings at the eastern and northern side of the courtyard were erected during the rule of Ottheinrich (1556\u20131559) and Friedrich IV (1583\u20131610). Under Friedrich V (1613\u20131619), the main building of the west side was erected, the so-called \"English Building\".\n\nThe castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the Palatine War of Succession. As Prince Elector Karl Theodor tried to restore the castle, lightning struck in 1764, and ended all attempts at rebuilding. Later on, the castle was misused as a quarry; stones from the castle were taken to build new houses in Heidelberg. This was stopped in 1800 by Count Charles de Graimberg, who then began the process of preserving the castle.\n\nAlthough the interior is in Gothic style, the King's Hall was not built until 1934. Today, the hall is used for festivities, e.g. dinner banquets, balls and theatre performances. During the Heidelberg Castle Festival in the summer, the courtyard is the site of open air musicals, operas, theatre performances, and classical concerts performed by the Heidelberg Philharmonics.\n\nThe castle is surrounded by a park, where the famous poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] once walked. The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] [[funicular]] railway runs from Kornmakt to the summit of the K\u00f6nigstuhl via the castle.\n\nThe castle looks over the entire city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schloss-heidelberg.de/en/home/|title=Schloss Heidelberg: Staatliche Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|website=www.schloss-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref>\n\n===Philosophers' Walk===\nOn the northern side of the Neckar is located the Heiligenberg (''Saints' Mountain''), along the side of which runs the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), with scenic views of the old town and castle. Traditionally, Heidelberg's philosophers and university professors would walk and talk along the pathway. Farther up the mountain lie the ruined 11th-century [[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]], the smaller Monastery of St. Stephen, a Nazi-era amphitheater, the so-called Pagan's hole and the remains of an earthen [[Celts|Celtic]] [[hill fort]] from the 4th century BC.\n\n[[File:View on the old Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|700px|center|View from the so-called \"Philosophers' Walk\"\n({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}) towards the Old Town, with [[Heidelberg Castle]], [[Heidelberg Heiliggeist church|Heiliggeist Church]] and the Old Bridge]]\n\n===Heidelberg churches===\n[[File:Heidelberg,_Alte_Br%C3%BCcke,_Heiliggeistkirche_20170601_004.jpg|[[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] tower and old bridge monument|thumb]]\n\nThere are many historical churches in Heidelberg and its surroundings. The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] has been shared over the centuries since the [[Protestant Reformation]] by both Catholics and Protestants. It is one of the few buildings to survive the many wars during the past centuries. It was rebuilt after the French set fire to it in 1709 during the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of the Palatinian Succession]]. The church has remains of the tombs and epitaphs of the past Palatinate electors. This Church stands in the ''Marktplatz'' next to the seat of local government. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town's Protestants as a result of giving the Church of the Holy Spirit exclusively to the Catholics for their use. It had previously been split by a partition and used by both congregations. Due to pressure by the mostly Protestant powers of Prussia, Holland, and Sweden, Prince Karl III Philip gave way and repartitioned the church for joint use. In 1936 the separating wall was removed. The church is now exclusively used by Protestants. Furthermore, there is the Catholic Church of the Jesuits. Its construction began in 1712. It was completed with the addition of a bell tower from 1866\u20131872. The church is also home to the Museum f\u00fcr sakrale Kunst und Liturgie (Museum of [[Ecclesiastical]] Arts). The oldest church in Heidelberg is the St. Peter's Church (now [[Lutheran]]). It was built some time during the 12th century.\n\n==Education==\n===Universities and academia===\n{{Main article|Heidelberg University|List of Heidelberg University people}}\n\n[[File:Heidelberg Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|The university library]]\n\nHeidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The most famous of those is [[Heidelberg University]] Founded in 1386, it is one of Europe's oldest institutions. In fact, Heidelberg is the oldest [[college town|university town]] of today's Germany. Among the prominent thinkers associated with the institution are [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Karl-Otto Apel]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. The campus is situated in two urban areas and several buildings. In numerous historical buildings in the old town there are the Faculties of the [[Humanities]], the [[Social Science]] and the Faculty of [[Jurisprudence|Law]]. The school of applied sciences is located in the ''Science Tower'' in Wieblingen. The Faculties of Medicine and [[Natural Science]] are settled on the Neuenheimer Feld Campus.\n\nThe campus of Heidelberg University has a total undergraduate enrollment of 30,898 as of 2014. The enrollment rate of this university is 16.3 percent. Less than 20 percent of the total student body is international. The main study area for international students is business. This university has many areas of study for national students such as; theology, law, philosophy, modern languages, economics, and social sciences. The university does not charge students for tuition. The school's academic calendar is semester based, and the majority of the language for instruction is in German. For international students the academic calendar is based on a block schedule. The international students attend in block periods of 5 weeks. The University or \"Uni\" is spread across three campuses each containing different fields of study.\n[[File:Heidlbergaula.JPG|thumb|left|Old university hall]]\nSince 1904 there has been a College of Educational Science, the ''P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Heidelberg''; since 1979 there has been a college of Jewish Studies, the ''[[Hochschule f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien Heidelberg]]''. It comprises nine branches specializing in both religion and [[Judaism|Jewish culture]]. The [[Schiller International University]], a private American university is also represented with a campus in Heidelberg offering several undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of International Business and International Relations and Diplomacy.\n\n===Research===\n[[File:EMBL campus Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings of [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in Heidelberg, including the new Advanced Training Centre]]\n\nIn addition to the research centers and institutes of the university, there are numerous research institutions situated in the city of Heidelberg. Among them are the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]], [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]], [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]], [[Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law]].\n\n===Schools===\n[[File:Fachhochschule Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|left|SRH Hochschule Heidelberg is one of the oldest and largest private universities in Germany]]\n\nHeidelberg is home to 23 elementary schools. There are several institutions of secondary education, both public and private, representing all levels of the [[German school system]]. There are 14 [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, with six of them private. With 52% of secondary students attending a Gymnasium, Heidelberg sits above the German average, perhaps because a large number of academics live in Heidelberg and its environs. \n\nThe gymnasiums include the {{ill|Kurf\u00fcrst-Friedrich-Gymnasium|de|Kurf\u00fcrst-Friedrich-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, {{ill|Bunsen-Gymnasium|de|Bunsen-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, [[Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg|Helmholtz-Gymnasium]], H\u00f6lderlin-Gymnasium and Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule. Then there are seven [[Realschule]], ten [[Hauptschule]] and nine [[vocational school]]s (the so-called ''[[Berufsschule]]''). In addition, there are several [[folk high schools]] with different specialisations.<ref>[http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044135/http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Heidelberg International School]] serves the local expatriate community.\n\n==Economy==\n===Tourism===\nIn 2004, 81.8% of people worked for service industries, including tourism. As a relic of the period of Romanticism, Heidelberg has been labeled a \"Romantic town\". This is used to attract more than 3.5 million visitors every year. Many events are organized to attract visitors. One of the biggest tourist attractions is the Christmas market during the winter time.\n\n===Industry===\nOnly 18% of employment is provided by industry. Printing and publishing are important enterprises; nearby [[Walldorf]] is a center of the IT industry and [[SAP SE|SAP]] World Headquarters. Noted pen manufacturer [[Lamy]] has its headquarters and factory in Heidelberg-Wieblingen. [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]] has its headquarters here; its factory is located in Walldorf. Soft-drink company Wild-Werke, manufacturer of the [[Capri-Sonne]] ([[Capri-Sun]] in the U.S.) is located nearby in Eppelheim. Heidelberg is also home to the headquarters of [[HeidelbergCement]], the world's second largest cement producer. The company has its roots in the suburb of Leimen where one of its cement plants is still located. With its long Hauptstrasse, Heidelberg is a shopping destination for people from the surrounding smaller towns.\n[[File:Heidelberger Druckmaschinen.jpg|thumb|right|Print Media Academy]]\n\n===Roads===\nThe [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5 autobahn]] runs through the western outskirts of Heidelberg, connecting the region to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the north and [[Karlsruhe]] to the south. The [[Bundesautobahn 656|A 656]] commences just west of the city, connecting Heidelberg with [[Mannheim]]. Both highways meet at Heidelberg autobahn intersection in the city of Heidelberg, and the A 656 connects to the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] at the Mannheim autobahn intersection, which connects to the east towards [[Stuttgart]].\n\nFurthermore, the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 3|B 3]] (Frankfurt\u2013Karlsruhe) runs north\u2013south through the town, and the B 37 (Mannheim\u2013[[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]]) runs east\u2013west. Both meet in the city center at the Bismarckplatz. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 535|B 535]] begin in the south of Heidelberg and runs to Schwetzingen.\n\n====Tourist roads====\nHeidelberg is located on four tourist roads: [[Bergstra\u00dfe Route|Bergstra\u00dfe]], [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], [[Castle Road]], and Stra\u00dfe der Demokratie (Road of Democracy).\n\n===Railways===\n[[Heidelberg Central Station]] (Hauptbahnhof) is on the [[Rhine Valley Railway]] and is served by [[Intercity-Express]], [[EuroCity in Germany|Euro City]] trains. This station is served by the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]]. There is also a station for [[intercity bus service]]s outside the central station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/heidelberg|title=Heidelberg: Stations|publisher= Travelinho}}</ref>\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:Heidelberg - EC - 2018-07-20 12-36-59.jpg|thumb|DB train [[Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nThe main transport hub of Heidelberg is the Bismarckplatz. Several main thoroughfares of the city intersect here and one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe, the Hauptstra\u00dfe (main street) runs from here through the entire old town of Heidelberg. Heidelberg Central Station was nearby for many years, which was a combined terminal and through station. In 1955, it was moved about 1.5&nbsp;km further to the west, which removed the necessity for trains continuing to the south or from the south to the north to reverse. The new central station became the second major transport hub of Heidelberg.\n\nHeidelberg has had a public transport service since 1883, when horse-drawn trams were established. Due to the rapidly rising patronage it was decided on 20 December 1901 to convert the [[Trams in Heidelberg|Heidelberg tramway network]] to electrical operation. On 16 March 1902, the first electric tram ran on Rohrbacher Stra\u00dfe, sharing use of the suburban tracks built by the ''Deutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'' in 1901 between Heidelberg and [[Wiesloch]]. Until the 1950s, the tram network was expanded a bit at a time. The rapidly growing popularity of car transport presented the operator of the trams with increasingly difficult problems and the tram network was gradually dismantled. It was not until 10 December 2006 that the network was extended again with the opening of a new tram line from [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]. Tram and bus services are now operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (RNV). Since 1989, all fares are set under a uniform scheme by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). [[Carsharing]] increasingly provides a complement to public transport. More than 50 car-sharing stations are available to users in 12 of the 14 districts of Heidelberg offering a total of more than 100 cars.\n[[File:Heidelberg - Bombardier RNV6 - RNV 4144 und RNV 4140 - 2016-08-25 14-39-04.jpg|thumb|Trams in Heidelberg]]\n\nSince 14 December 2003, Heidelberg has been connected to the network of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]], which opens up the entire Rhine-Neckar region, with lines connecting with the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], the [[Saarland]] and southern [[Hesse]].\n\nThe [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] (Heidelberg Mountain Railway) has run since 2005 with new cars on the lower part from Kornmarkt to Molkenkur and historic cars built in 1907 on the upper section of the [[funicular]] from Molkenkur to [[K\u00f6nigstuhl (Odenwald)|K\u00f6nigstuhl]]. It is one of the most popular means to reach [[Heidelberg Castle]]. The first plans for the funicular were drawn up in 1873. Due to a lack of funds was the first section of the funicular was not opened until 1890. In 2004, the upper section of the funicular was listed as part of the heritage of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n===United States military installations===\n{{see also|United States Army Garrison Heidelberg}}\n[[File:Behoerdenzentrum Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Beh\u00f6rdenzentrum Heidelberg]]\nDuring World War II, Heidelberg was one of the few major cities in Germany not significantly damaged by Allied bombing. Situated in the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone]] of Germany, Heidelberg became the headquarters of the American forces in Europe. The main military facilities were [[Campbell Barracks]], the former Wehrmacht Grossdeutschland-Kaserne, which housed the US Army, Europe ([[USAREUR]]) and [[NATO]]'s Component Command-Land Headquarters. (Until 2004, this was designated Joint Headquarters Centre, and before that, LANDCENT).\n\nCampbell Barracks and [[Mark Twain Village]] were both in S\u00fcdstadt; Patton Barracks was in nearby Kirchheim. Nachrichten Kaserne in Rohrbach was home to the former Heidelberg Army Hospital, later designated the Heidelberg Health Center. [[Patrick Henry Village]], the largest U.S. military housing area in the Heidelberg area, was west of Kirchheim. These installations, including Tompkins Barracks and Kilbourne Kaserne in nearby Schwetzingen, plus the Germersheim Depot, made up the U.S. Army Garrison Heidelberg. Tompkins Barracks was home to [http://www.imcom-europe.army.mil U.S. Army Installation Management Command Europe Region.] The Heidelberg U.S. Army Air Field (Heidelberg AAF) was converted to a<s>n</s> heliport (mostly Blackhawk Helicopters) after the [[NATO]] [[Kosovo]] campaign.\n[[File:Heidelberg Bahnstadt Langer Anger 2.JPG|thumb|left|The New city district of Heidelberg, [[Bahnstadt]], is one of the biggest [[passive house]] settlements in the world]]\nThe children of [[United States Department of Defense]] employees based in Heidelberg attended on-base schools operated by the DODDS-E (Department of Defense Dependents Schools&nbsp;\u2013 Europe).

The phase after [[Jena Romanticism]] is often called '''Heidelberg Romanticism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (see also [[Berlin Romanticism]]). There was a famous circle of poets (the '''Heidelberg Romantics'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->), such as [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Johann Joseph von G\u00f6rres]], [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]], and [[Clemens Brentano]]. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.\n\nThe ''Romantik'' epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.\n\n===Old Heidelberg===\n{{Further information|Alt Heidelberg (play)}}\nIn 1901 [[Wilhelm Meyer-F\u00f6rster]] wrote the play ''[[Old Heidelberg (play)|Old Heidelberg]]'' which was followed by a large number of film adaptations.
