He was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) [[Merseyside West (European Parliament constituency)|Merseyside West]] from 1996 to 1999 (under the system that predated the [[proportional representation]] regional system)  and then for [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] from 1999 to 2009, when he lost his seat, and again from 2014 to 2020. He attended Shadow Cabinet meetings and was a member of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee. \n\nBetween January 2010 and February 2014, Corbett was an advisor to the first full-time and long-term [[President of the European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]]. In this capacity, and as a frequent writer and commentator on European affairs, he was voted by a panel of retired diplomats, journalists, academics and think-tankers on 14 November 2012 as the fourth most influential Briton on EU policy, ahead of the Prime Minister.<ref>organised by the European Media Network EurActiv, see http://EurActiv.com/UK40</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Corbett became the first MEP to write a regular personal blog, and in 2015 he became the first British politician to develop and release a phone app.<ref>{{cite web|title = Many appy returns (Richard Corbett)|url = http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/many-appy-returns/|accessdate = 22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nCorbett was born in [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]], to parents of working-class background from Wales and London. He attended primary school at Farnborough Road School in Southport. When his father was offered a post as a statistician at the [[World Health Organization]], the family moved to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and Corbett attended the [[International School of Geneva]] (attended at the time mostly by children from [[UNOG|UN Agencies in Geneva]]), where he obtained the [[International Baccalaureate]]. He was captain of the football team and also played for the junior team of a Swiss second division club.\n\nHe won a place at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], the first generation of his family to be able to go to university, and obtained a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. He was the Secretary of the [[Oxford University Labour Club|Labour Club]] and chairman of the Oxford Committee for Europe. He co-ordinated the Oxford student 'Yes' campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on membership of the [[European Community]]. He also skied for Oxford against Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/about-me/ |title=Richard Corbett | publisher=Richardcorbett.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nCorbett later completed a doctorate in political science at the [[University of Hull]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/about-me/ |title=Richard Corbett |publisher=Richardcorbett.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Before the European Parliament===\nRichard Corbett's activities in the European Students at Oxford led on to him being elected first to the youth board of the [[European Movement]] in Britain and then to the international presidency of the youth wing of the European Movement and of the [[Union of European Federalists]], the [[Young European Federalists]] (JEF), a post he held from 1979 to 1981, drafting their manifesto which was the first to coin the phrase \"[[democratic deficit]]\" in relation to the European Parliament's then lack of power over European legislation.\n\nCorbett was secretary-general of the European Co-ordination Bureau of International Non-Governmental Youth Organisations from 1977 to 1981, representing youth organisations in the [[Council of Europe]]'s European Youth Foundation and European Youth Centre. He also helped to set up the [[European Youth Forum]] and represented [[Western Europe]]an youth organisations in negotiations with [[Eastern Europe]]an organisations pursuant to the Helsinki Treaty (as well as at the World Festival of Youth in [[Havana]] in 1978 along with [[Charles Clarke]] and [[Peter Mandelson]]). He worked with [[Altiero Spinelli]] MEP on the latter's proposal for a draft treaty establishing a European Union, adopted by the European Parliament in 1984.\n\nBefore being elected to the European Parliament, Corbett worked in the [[voluntary sector]] and as a civil servant,<ref name=\"auto\"/> later becoming a policy advisor to and then Deputy Secretary General of the [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist Group]] in the European Parliament. He worked on drafting the parts of the treaties of [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] and [[Amsterdam Treaty|Amsterdam]] that increased the powers of the Parliament, notably helping to draft the \"[[codecision procedure]]\" which now applies for adopting [[Law of the European Union|European legislation]] through successive readings of the Parliament and the [[European Council|Council]].\n\nIn 1992, Corbett was made Ambassador of Goodwill of the US State of [[Arkansas]], by its then Governor [[Bill Clinton]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===The European Parliament===\nCorbett was a member of the Parliament's [[Committee on Constitutional Affairs|Constitutional Affairs committee]] and from 1999 to 2009 was the spokesman for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as well as the whole of the wider [[Group of the Party of European Socialists]], on European constitutional affairs. In 2006, he was elected Deputy Leader of the [[European Parliamentary Labour Party]], which he remained until the end of his period as an MEP, declining (to some surprise) to challenge for the leadership when [[Gary Titley]] stood down in 2008.\n\nIn 2003, his proposals to re-write the European Parliament's [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013075828/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=56  Rules of Procedure] were largely accepted. In 2004\u20132005, he was the co-rapporteur (with [[I\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo]]) for Parliament on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe]]. This report formed the basis of Parliament's official position on the treaty, which he was then invited to present to several national parliaments.\n\nIn 2005, he was appointed as Parliament's negotiator (along with [[Joseph Daul]] MEP) to broker a new system of parliamentary scrutiny over Commission implementing measures (under the previously much-criticised \"[[comitology]]\" procedure), which led to an agreement among the Council of ministers, the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the Parliament in 2006 giving Parliament the right to [[veto]] quasi-legislative implementing measures. This represented a major increase in Parliament's powers over the Commission.\n\nIn 2007\u201308, he was again co-rapporteur with [[I\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo]] for Parliament on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], (which replaced the constitutional treaty after two member states had declined to ratify it) and was again rapporteur for a new overhaul of Parliament's procedures in 2009, 2016 and 2018.\n\nThroughout his career, Richard Corbett has been a strong advocate of EU reform and has a particular interest in improving democratic accountability by continuing to increase the European Parliament's power within the EU institutional system. Professor Juliet Lodge of Leeds University has named Corbett as one of five \"movers and shakers\" in the European Parliament who \"have brought the European Parliament from being a mere talking shop to a legislature with genuine power\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jmecelabblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/movers-and-shakers-the-making-of-the-european-parliament/ |title=UPDATED: Movers and Shakers: The making of the European Parliament |publisher=Jmecelabblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nCorbett's voting record and other parliamentary activities can be found on the VoteWatch website.<ref>{{cite web|last=VoteWatch.eu|title=VoteWatch.eu|url=http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-richard-corbett.html|publisher=VoteWatch.eu|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, Corbett won SME4Labour's 'MEP of the Year' award.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Richard Corbett versus the UK Independence Party===\nRichard Corbett has been critical of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP).\n\nIn June 2004, he drew attention, in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, to UKIP links with the far-right [[British National Party]] in that year's local elections: \"In Yorkshire, where both the [[British National Party|BNP]] and UKIP put up candidates, they appear to have come to an arrangement not to stand against one another\".\n\nRichard Corbett's pamphlet ''25 Things You Didn't Know When You Voted For UKIP'',<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Corbett |url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/assets/docs/briefing/theres-something-about-ukip.pdf |title=25 Things You Didn't Know When You Voted For UKIP |accessdate=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615235927/http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/assets/docs/briefing/theres-something-about-ukip.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}</ref> published by Britain in Europe in 2004, caused controversy in October 2004, when UKIP demanded that the pamphlet be pulped, claiming that one item in the pamphlet \"breaks a court order banning publication of details of a legal action involving one of the party's MEPs\", namely the fraud case against UKIP MEP [[Ashley Mote]]. In practice, this gave further publicity to the pamphlet, which was not pulped, as it did not break any court order.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFollowing Ashley Mote's imprisonment in September 2007 for fraud,<ref>{{cite news|first=Bonnie |last=Malkin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1562127/MEP-jailed-for-benefit-fraud.html |title=MEP jailed for benefit fraud|work=Daily Telegraph|date= 5 September 2007|accessdate=30 April 2008}}</ref> Corbett called on the government to change the law which allowed the former UKIP MEP to be paid in full during his spell in jail. The Minister responsible for payment of MEPs (and MPs), [[Harriet Harman]], promised to look into the matter.\n\nCorbett continued to campaign vigorously against the UK Independence Party in the run-up to the 2014 European elections. After they secured the biggest share of the vote in these elections, he subsequently wrote \"I think it is a mistake to focus exclusively on UKIP's racism. That unsavoury side of UKIP has been adequately exposed by others [...] We need to expose them on their policies\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Corbett's blog entry|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/some-thoughts-election-results/|publisher=richardcorbett.org.uk|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Five years out of the European Parliament===\nCorbett lost his seat in the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European Parliament elections]], which saw a big fall in the Labour share of the vote in the wake of the [[Westminster expenses scandal]]. The [[British National Party|BNP]] took the seat. The [[BBC News|BBC]] website carried the following comment from their European editor, [[Mark Mardell]]:\n\n{{quote|The saddest moment of the night: Labour MEP Richard Corbett lost his seat. Irrespective of party politics, there are some people who are good for politics as a whole. Mr Corbett, a decent, thoughtful politician, is also one of the few people who understand how the European Parliament actually works and explained it well. He'll be missed on all sides of the chamber.}}\n\nMark Mardell had previously referred to Richard Corbett as:\n{{quote|an example of a conscientious and hard working politician if ever there was one.}}\n\nAfter his defeat, Corbett spent two months in Ireland from August to October 2009 helping (behind the scenes) the \"Yes\" campaign in the second [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Irish referendum]] on the [[Lisbon Treaty]], in which 67% of the 59% turnout voted in favour.\n\nIn December 2009, he was invited to join the private office (''[[President of the European Council#President's cabinet|cabinet]]'') of the first full-time President of the [[European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]], as his advisor on constitutional issues, but also handling his relations with the European Parliament and national parliaments, with the Committee of Regions and the Economic and Social Committee as well as helping on relations with some governments, including the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/cabinet.aspx?lang=en |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100805030957/http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/cabinet.aspx?lang=en |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 August 2010 |title=European Council - Cabinet |publisher=European-council.europa.eu |accessdate=11 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Return to the European Parliament===\nCorbett left the Van Rompuy ''cabinet'' in March 2014, in order to stand for election in the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European Parliament elections]] as the Labour party's second candidate in Yorkshire & Humber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/ |title=Richard Corbett |publisher=Richardcorbett.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> In Labour's internal ballot of party members to choose their candidates, Corbett came first (with the highest proportion of first preference votes of all new candidates in the country) securing him second spot on the list of Labour candidates, behind the sitting MEP [[Linda McAvan]]. Labour won two seats in the election in Yorkshire, and so Corbett was returned to the Parliament.\n\nIn Parliament, Corbett returned to the Constitutional Committee and serves also on the Fisheries Committee (as a full member) and the Economic Committee (as a substitute). He was elected again as Deputy Leader of the Labour MEPs in September 2014. He was again rapporteur for a new overhaul of Parliament's procedures in 2016 and 2018\u201319. On 25 October 2017 he was elected Leader of the Labour MEPs (EPLP) following the retirement of [[Glenis Willmott]], defeating [[Si\u00f4n Simon]] and [[Clare Moody (politician)|Clare Moody]] in the vote.\n\nIn advance of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], Corbett launched an app called ''Doorstep EU'' for [[IPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in order to debunk myths about the EU, deliver authoritative briefings on key issues and detailed statistics of the EU's impact on the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/app/|title=App - Richard Corbett|website=Richard Corbett|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Owen Smith]] in the [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mps-nominating-owen-smith-labour-8451186|title=Which MPs are nominating Owen Smith in the Labour leadership contest?|last1=Smith|first1=Mikey|date=20 July 2016|work=Mirror|accessdate=10 November 2018|last2=Bloom|first2=Dan|location=}}</ref>\n\n==Other activities==\n===Sport===\nIn 2006, Corbett served on the Independent European Sport Review,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eose.org/ressource/independant-european-sports-review/|title=Independent European Sport Review|last=|first=|date=1 October 2006|website=EOSE|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> set up by several national governments and [[UEFA]] and chaired by the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Arnaut. The review focused particularly on football, and Corbett chaired the sub-group on political aspects. He has maintained an interest in the governance of football ever since, taking up a number of issues with UEFA.\n\n===Grimethorpe Colliery Band===\nCorbett is the Honorary President of the [[Grimethorpe Colliery Band]] a brass band, based in Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire. The band achieved worldwide fame after appearing in the film ''[[Brassed Off]]'', as well as becoming (along with Black Dyke Mills Band), the first brass band to perform at the Proms.\n\n===Labour Party positions===\nCorbett has held a number of offices in the [[UK Labour Party]]. As well as being Deputy Leader and, since October 2017, Leader of the [[European Parliamentary Labour Party]] (EPLP), he served on the Regional Board for [[Yorkshire]] and the party's National Policy Forum, a position to which he was re-elected by fellow Labour MEPs in May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/agenda-2020/npf?filter%5Bregion%5D=&filter%5Btu_organisation%5D=0&filter%5Btype%5D=only_npf&filter%5Bnpf%5D=1&filter%5Bpcm%5D=|title=Labour Party National Policy Forum|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Labour Party|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> He was formerly national chair of the [[Labour Movement for Europe]], and now serves as one of its Labour MEP representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://labourmovement.eu/about/|title=Labour Movement for Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Labour Movement for Europe|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Leader of the EPLP, Corbett is a member of the [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) of the Labour Party and attends [[shadow cabinet]] meetings.\n\n===Other organisations===\nCorbett is Vice Chair of the UK [[European Movement]], having served as Chair following the resignation of [[Laura Sandys]] in the wake of the 2016 referendum result.

In 2003, he was the first MEP from any country to launch a [[blog]], which he resumed in 2014 as part of his election campaign. In 2004 his website was cited as one of the most comprehensive of any British politician's by ''New Statesman'' magazine, which nominated him for a New Media award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/many-appy-returns/|title=Many appy returns (blog post)|last=|first=|date=20 April 2016|website=Richard Corbett|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> In 2015, he became the first MEP to launch a mobile app, Doorstep EU, aimed at activists, journalists and other politicians.

He was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) [[Merseyside West (European Parliament constituency)|Merseyside West]] from 1996 to 1999 (under the system that predated the [[proportional representation]] regional system)  and then for [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] from 1999 to 2009, when he lost his seat, and again from 2014 to 2020. He attended Shadow Cabinet meetings and was a member of the Labour Party\u2019s National Executive Committee. \n\nBetween January 2010 and February 2014, Corbett was an advisor to the first full-time and long-term [[President of the European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]]. In this capacity, and as a frequent writer and commentator on European affairs, he was voted by a panel of retired diplomats, journalists, academics and think-tankers on 14 November 2012 as the fourth most influential Briton on EU policy, ahead of the Prime Minister.<ref>organised by the European Media Network EurActiv, see http://EurActiv.com/UK40</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Corbett became the first MEP to write a regular personal blog, and in 2015 he became the first British politician to develop and release a phone app.<ref>{{cite web|title = Many appy returns (Richard Corbett)|url = http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/many-appy-returns/|accessdate = 22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nCorbett was born in [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]], to parents of working-class background from Wales and London. He attended primary school at Farnborough Road School in Southport. When his father was offered a post as a statistician at the [[World Health Organization]], the family moved to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and Corbett attended the [[International School of Geneva]] (attended at the time mostly by children from [[UNOG|UN Agencies in Geneva]]), where he obtained the [[International Baccalaureate]]. He was captain of the football team and also played for the junior team of a Swiss second division club.\n\nHe won a place at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], the first generation of his family to be able to go to university, and obtained a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. He was the Secretary of the [[Oxford University Labour Club|Labour Club]] and chairman of the Oxford Committee for Europe. He co-ordinated the Oxford student 'Yes' campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on membership of the [[European Community]]. He also skied for Oxford against Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/about-me/ |title=Richard Corbett | publisher=Richardcorbett.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nCorbett later completed a doctorate in political science at the [[University of Hull]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/about-me/ |title=Richard Corbett |publisher=Richardcorbett.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Before the European Parliament===\nRichard Corbett's activities in the European Students at Oxford led on to him being elected first to the youth board of the [[European Movement]] in Britain and then to the international presidency of the youth wing of the European Movement and of the [[Union of European Federalists]], the [[Young European Federalists]] (JEF), a post he held from 1979 to 1981, drafting their manifesto which was the first to coin the phrase \"[[democratic deficit]]\" in relation to the European Parliament's then lack of power over European legislation.\n\nCorbett was secretary-general of the European Co-ordination Bureau of International Non-Governmental Youth Organisations from 1977 to 1981, representing youth organisations in the [[Council of Europe]]'s European Youth Foundation and European Youth Centre. He also helped to set up the [[European Youth Forum]] and represented [[Western Europe]]an youth organisations in negotiations with [[Eastern Europe]]an organisations pursuant to the Helsinki Treaty (as well as at the World Festival of Youth in [[Havana]] in 1978 along with [[Charles Clarke]] and [[Peter Mandelson]]). He worked with [[Altiero Spinelli]] MEP on the latter's proposal for a draft treaty establishing a European Union, adopted by the European Parliament in 1984.\n\nBefore being elected to the European Parliament, Corbett worked in the [[voluntary sector]] and as a civil servant,<ref name=\"auto\"/> later becoming a policy advisor to and then Deputy Secretary General of the [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist Group]] in the European Parliament. He worked on drafting the parts of the treaties of [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] and [[Amsterdam Treaty|Amsterdam]] that increased the powers of the Parliament, notably helping to draft the \"[[codecision procedure]]\" which now applies for adopting [[Law of the European Union|European legislation]] through successive readings of the Parliament and the [[European Council|Council]].\n\nIn 1992, Corbett was made Ambassador of Goodwill of the US State of [[Arkansas]], by its then Governor [[Bill Clinton]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===The European Parliament===\nCorbett was a member of the Parliament's [[Committee on Constitutional Affairs|Constitutional Affairs committee]] and from 1999 to 2009 was the spokesman for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as well as the whole of the wider [[Group of the Party of European Socialists]], on European constitutional affairs. In 2006, he was elected Deputy Leader of the [[European Parliamentary Labour Party]], which he remained until the end of his period as an MEP, declining (to some surprise) to challenge for the leadership when [[Gary Titley]] stood down in 2008.\n\nIn 2003, his proposals to re-write the European Parliament's [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013075828/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=56  Rules of Procedure] were largely accepted. In 2004\u20132005, he was the co-rapporteur (with [[I\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo]]) for Parliament on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe]]. This report formed the basis of Parliament's official position on the treaty, which he was then invited to present to several national parliaments.\n\nIn 2005, he was appointed as Parliament's negotiator (along with [[Joseph Daul]] MEP) to broker a new system of parliamentary scrutiny over Commission implementing measures (under the previously much-criticised \"[[comitology]]\" procedure), which led to an agreement among the Council of ministers, the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the Parliament in 2006 giving Parliament the right to [[veto]] quasi-legislative implementing measures. This represented a major increase in Parliament's powers over the Commission.\n\nIn 2007\u201308, he was again co-rapporteur with [[I\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo]] for Parliament on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], (which replaced the constitutional treaty after two member states had declined to ratify it) and was again rapporteur for a new overhaul of Parliament's procedures in 2009, 2016 and 2018.\n\nThroughout his career, Richard Corbett has been a strong advocate of EU reform and has a particular interest in improving democratic accountability by continuing to increase the European Parliament's power within the EU institutional system. Professor Juliet Lodge of Leeds University has named Corbett as one of five \"movers and shakers\" in the European Parliament who \"have brought the European Parliament from being a mere talking shop to a legislature with genuine power\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jmecelabblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/movers-and-shakers-the-making-of-the-european-parliament/ |title=UPDATED: Movers and Shakers: The making of the European Parliament |publisher=Jmecelabblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nCorbett's voting record and other parliamentary activities can be found on the VoteWatch website.<ref>{{cite web|last=VoteWatch.eu|title=VoteWatch.eu|url=http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-richard-corbett.html|publisher=VoteWatch.eu|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, Corbett won SME4Labour's 'MEP of the Year' award.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Richard Corbett versus the UK Independence Party===\nRichard Corbett has been critical of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP).\n\nIn June 2004, he drew attention, in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, to UKIP links with the far-right [[British National Party]] in that year's local elections: \"In Yorkshire, where both the [[British National Party|BNP]] and UKIP put up candidates, they appear to have come to an arrangement not to stand against one another\".\n\nRichard Corbett's pamphlet ''25 Things You Didn't Know When You Voted For UKIP'',<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Corbett |url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/assets/docs/briefing/theres-something-about-ukip.pdf |title=25 Things You Didn't Know When You Voted For UKIP |accessdate=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615235927/http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/assets/docs/briefing/theres-something-about-ukip.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}</ref> published by Britain in Europe in 2004, caused controversy in October 2004, when UKIP demanded that the pamphlet be pulped, claiming that one item in the pamphlet \"breaks a court order banning publication of details of a legal action involving one of the party's MEPs\", namely the fraud case against UKIP MEP [[Ashley Mote]]. In practice, this gave further publicity to the pamphlet, which was not pulped, as it did not break any court order.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFollowing Ashley Mote's imprisonment in September 2007 for fraud,<ref>{{cite news|first=Bonnie |last=Malkin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1562127/MEP-jailed-for-benefit-fraud.html |title=MEP jailed for benefit fraud|work=Daily Telegraph|date= 5 September 2007|accessdate=30 April 2008}}</ref> Corbett called on the government to change the law which allowed the former UKIP MEP to be paid in full during his spell in jail. The Minister responsible for payment of MEPs (and MPs), [[Harriet Harman]], promised to look into the matter.\n\nCorbett continued to campaign vigorously against the UK Independence Party in the run-up to the 2014 European elections. After they secured the biggest share of the vote in these elections, he subsequently wrote \"I think it is a mistake to focus exclusively on UKIP's racism. That unsavoury side of UKIP has been adequately exposed by others [...] We need to expose them on their policies\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Corbett's blog entry|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/some-thoughts-election-results/|publisher=richardcorbett.org.uk|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Five years out of the European Parliament===\nCorbett lost his seat in the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European Parliament elections]], which saw a big fall in the Labour share of the vote in the wake of the [[Westminster expenses scandal]]. The [[British National Party|BNP]] took the seat. The [[BBC News|BBC]] website carried the following comment from their European editor, [[Mark Mardell]]:\n\n{{quote|The saddest moment of the night: Labour MEP Richard Corbett lost his seat.

Labour won two seats in the election in Yorkshire, and so Corbett was returned to the Parliament.\n\nIn Parliament, Corbett returned to the Constitutional Committee and serves also on the Fisheries Committee (as a full member) and the Economic Committee (as a substitute). He was elected again as Deputy Leader of the Labour MEPs in September 2014. He was again rapporteur for a new overhaul of Parliament's procedures in 2016 and 2018-19. On 25 October 2017 he was elected Leader of the Labour MEPs (EPLP) following the retirement of [[Glenis Willmott]], defeating [[Si\u00f4n Simon]] and [[Clare Moody (politician)|Clare Moody]] in the vote.\n\nIn advance of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], Corbett launched an app called ''Doorstep EU'' for [[IPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in order to debunk myths about the EU, deliver authoritative briefings on key issues and detailed statistics of the EU's impact on the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/app/|title=App - Richard Corbett|website=Richard Corbett|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Owen Smith]] in the [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mps-nominating-owen-smith-labour-8451186|title=Which MPs are nominating Owen Smith in the Labour leadership contest?|last1=Smith|first1=Mikey|date=20 July 2016|work=Mirror|accessdate=10 November 2018|last2=Bloom|first2=Dan|location=}}</ref>\n\n==Other activities==\n===Sport===\nIn 2006, Corbett served on the Independent European Sport Review,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eose.org/ressource/independant-european-sports-review/|title=Independent European Sport Review|last=|first=|date=1 October 2006|website=EOSE|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> set up by several national governments and [[UEFA]] and chaired by the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Arnaut. The review focused particularly on football, and Corbett chaired the sub-group on political aspects. He has maintained an interest in the governance of football ever since, taking up a number of issues with UEFA.\n\n===Grimethorpe Colliery Band===\nCorbett is the Honorary President of the [[Grimethorpe Colliery Band]] a brass band, based in Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire. The band achieved worldwide fame after appearing in the film ''[[Brassed Off]]'', as well as becoming (along with Black Dyke Mills Band), the first brass band to perform at the Proms.\n\n===Labour Party positions===\nCorbett has held a number of offices in the [[UK Labour Party]]. As well as being Deputy Leader and, since October 2017, Leader of the [[European Parliamentary Labour Party]] (EPLP), he served on the Regional Board for [[Yorkshire]] and the party's National Policy Forum, a position to which he was re-elected by fellow Labour MEPs in May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/agenda-2020/npf?filter%5Bregion%5D=&filter%5Btu_organisation%5D=0&filter%5Btype%5D=only_npf&filter%5Bnpf%5D=1&filter%5Bpcm%5D=|title=Labour Party National Policy Forum|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Labour Party|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> He was formerly national chair of the [[Labour Movement for Europe]], and now serves as one of its Labour MEP representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://labourmovement.eu/about/|title=Labour Movement for Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Labour Movement for Europe|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Leader of the EPLP, Corbett is a member of the [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) of the Labour Party and attends [[shadow cabinet]] meetings.\n\n===Other organisations===\nCorbett is Vice Chair of the UK [[European Movement]], having served as Chair following the resignation of [[Laura Sandys]] in the wake of the 2016 referendum result.

In 2003, he was the first MEP from any country to launch a [[blog]], which he resumed in 2014 as part of his election campaign. In 2004 his website was cited as one of the most comprehensive of any British politician's by ''New Statesman'' magazine, which nominated him for a New Media award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/many-appy-returns/|title=Many appy returns (blog post)|last=|first=|date=20 April 2016|website=Richard Corbett|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> In 2015, he became the first MEP to launch a mobile app, Doorstep EU, aimed at activists, journalists and other politicians.

Pots set out to collect the sap are contaminated with flying fox urine and feces, and the bats also lick the sap streams flowing into the pots.

The Model 4's case also switched from spray-painted translucent plastic to molded plastic, ensuring that the coloring is not vulnerable to peeling or rubbing.\n\nThe Model 4 uses WD1770/1773 floppy controllers instead of the WD1791, which allows for a larger gap between the index hole and first sector; later releases of TRSDOS and LDOS were modified for compatibility with the controller.\n\nThe Model 4 shipped with [[TRSDOS]] 6, identical to Logical Systems's LDOS 6.00 third-party [[operating system]] (itself an enhancement to older versions of TRSDOS). When the Model 4 boots into TRSDOS 6, the video display switches into 80\u00d724 mode and the entire 64KB address space is mapped as RAM. \n\nWhen booted from a Model III operating system disk, the Model 4 enters 64\u00d716 video mode and maps Model III ROMs from address zero, making it capable of running Model III software. Model 4 features can be accessed in Model III mode by manipulating the computer's hardware ports. The LDOS 5.3 update supports SYSTEM (FAST) to enable the Model 4's 4 MHz clock speed.

It uses the upper 64KB of a 128KB machine to keep resident a second TRSDOS application, which can be switched instantly with another application loaded into the main 64KB. A third partition is available for TRSDOS library commands, such as DIR. DoubleDuty first appeared in Radio Shack's 1985 Computer Catalog (RSC-12), the same year that IBM's [[Topview]], Apple's Switcher, and Quarterdeck's [[DESQview]] first became available. DoubleDuty was written by Randy Cook, the author of the first version of TRSDOS for the original Model I.\n\nThe Model 4's memory mapping and OS more closely resemble the TRS-80 Model II than it does the Model III. Like the Model II, there is no ROM-based OS and all OS software was RAM-resident and loaded from disk at bootup. There is only a small boot loader ROM which checks for the presence of a Model 4 OS disk and if one is not detected, it defaults to Model III mode. Also like the Model II, the OS uses vectored API calls instead of absolute addresses, and software developers were encouraged to use the API calls rather than low-level hardware access to ensure compatibility with future iterations of TRSDOS 6.<ref group=\"note\">The term \"API\" is one used by other computer systems. On the Model 4 applications interface with the DOS via \"Supervisor Calls\"; on the Models I/III direct Z80 machine language Z80 CALL instructions are issued to absolute addresses in ROM. On the Model 4 the Z80 accumulator is loaded with the SVC number and a RST 40 instruction is issued. TRSDOS uses the SVC number to index into a jump table maintained in low memory. This is obviously an advantage because it enables the programmer to revector SVCs to customized service routines.</ref>\n\nRather than accessing the memory-mapped keyboard and video directly as on the Models I and III, TRSDOS SVCs are used. This method permits I/O redirection over all the computer's devices, including the disk drives. This makes possible, for example, to \"print\" a document to a disk file so it can be printed at a later time. Another frequent use of I/O redirection is redirecting video output to the printer for permanent hardcopy of a program run. TRSDOS supplies the {{code|LINK}}, {{code|ROUTE}}, and {{code|FILTER}} commands to enable these capabilities. This method also ensures consistent communication between memory resident modules attached to the OS's logical devices. Some applications programmers, however, circumvent this device-independent approach by physically accessing the computer hardware, such as Radio Shack's SuperScripsit word processor; its programmers insisted on having the CTL255 routine built into the keyboard driver expressly for this purpose. Another offender was Anitek Software's Lescript. These two applications ignore any filter programs attached to the keyboard device, depriving the user of some [[terminate and stay resident program]]s, such as Misosys' Sidekick-like Pro-WAM Window Application Manager, as well as the TRSDOS KSM/FLT keystroke multiplier macro facility.\n\nThe disk drives are identical to the Model III, consisting of one or two single-sided full-height 5.25\" drives (various brands of disk drive were used in the Model 4, while the Model III had exclusively Tandons), providing 180KB of storage with TRSDOS. An additional two drives can connect via the external floppy port. Any floppy drive with the Shugart-style 34-pin interface can be used; thus it is possible to upgrade a Model 4 to use double-sided, 80 track, or even 3.5\" 720 KB (low density) floppies. Drive select is implemented via the card edge connectors for the drives; the connector for each drive bay has certain conductors missing that identify the lower drive as system drive zero, and the upper drive as system drive one. Thus the drives do not have drive select jumpers, and are identical. This makes the drives in a dual drive Model 4 interchangeable. Replacement with third-party double-sided drives requires use of a new drive cable and connectors with all conductors present; in this case drive select is made with jumpers on the drives.\n\nExternal hard disks were available using the computer's 50 pin expansion card-edge, which also permit other external hardware requiring direct access to the Z80 buses. These include Atari style joystick adapters or the line of data acquisition devices marketed by Alpha Products. A parallel printer can be added using another card-edge connector provided for this purpose. An RS-232 serial port was optional on the original versions of the Model 4.\n\nThe baseline Model 4 uses a 16kx1 DRAM known as the 8040517. This chip, also used in 16k TRS-80 CoCo 2s, is functionally identical to a 4116 DRAM, but only uses +5V power instead of the 4116's tri-voltage power. 64k and 128k models use standard 4164 DRAMs. Unlike previous machines, the RS-232 port is standard equipment rather than an extra cost option. The RS-232 and printer ports are also moved to the back instead of the underside of the computer, making them more easily accessible.\n\nThe Model 4 was announced in the same press release (April 1983) as was the [[TRS-80 Model 100]] laptop. The two computers were often marketed by Tandy/Radio Shack as a complementary pair. Model 100 cassette tapes are readable on the Model 4 with its cassette interface and a TRSDOS 6 utility called TAPE100/CMD, which store Model 100 programs and data as TRSDOS disk files. Programs and files can be transferred back and forth via an RS-232 serial null modem cable, or over a telephone line using a modem on the Model 4 end (the Model 100 has a built-in modem). Both the Model 4 and the Model 100 came with terminal software as a built-in feature.\n\nEarly versions of the Model 4 mainboard were designed to accept a [[Zilog Z800]] 16 bit CPU upgrade board to replace the Z80 8 bit CPU but this option was never released. In 1987 H.I. Tech produced an enhanced CPU board, the '''XLR8er''', using the [[Hitachi HD64180]] Z80-compatible processor. It runs with a 6.144 MHz clock rate and adds 256KB of memory that could be used as a RAM disk. When combined with the upper 64KB of Model 4 banked RAM, a ramdisk of up to 384KB can be mounted. Later, software was developed that can access XLR8er RAM as standard TRSDOS 32KB banks through the @BANK supervisor call. This makes the extra memory accessible to standard TRSDOS applications coded to use banked RAM. The Hitachi CPU also executes many Z80 instructions in fewer clock cycles than the Zilog chip; 8Mhz performance was claimed but in reality most software realize a performance improvement of only 25 to 30 percent.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions are programs that made heavy use of the Z80 block instructions like LDIR and CPIR. This group of instructions take 21 transition states per iteration to execute on a Z80; on the HD64180 they take only 14. These sorts of programs realize an effective peak clock speed of 9 megahertz (112.5% speedup) on the XLR8er. Since the TRSDOS video driver uses LDIR to scroll the video display, screen scrolling is especially snappy with the XLR8er. Enthusiast created programs can access the 64180's [[Direct Memory Access|DMA]] channels to attain an even higher rate of data transfer. {{cite web |title=The Misosys Quarterly Vol VI.i Autumn 1991, \"The Final Solution to the XLR8er Question\" by J.F.R. \"Frank\" Slinkman, page 33 |url=http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20VI.i.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=Roy Soltoff/Misosys Inc. |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Model 4 include a sound generator, a first for the TRS-80 line as the Model I/III require the user to output sounds to the cassette port, which is then connected to a stereo amplifier for sound output. However its sound capabilities are extremely limited, with just seven tones that can be produced, ranging from C to G\u266d on the musical scale, and there is no E. Each tone had 32 different durations it can be sounded for. TRSDOS includes a filter program, {{code|CLICK/FLT}}, that beeps the speaker each time a key was pressed, to provide audible feedback for the typist. One Radio Shack spokesman described the Model 4's sound generator as \"being intended for business alerts\".\n\n===== TRSDOS 6 Features =====\n\nTRSDOS 6 provides utilities and filters for the Model 4's new hardware features.<ref group=\"note\">LDOS 5.x in Model III mode supports most all TRSDOS 6 features described here. The two most obvious exceptions are MEMDISK and SPOOL.</ref>\n\n{{code|SPOOL}}, a [[print spooler]] that runs as a background task while other applications are in use, can use the extra 64KB RAM, base 64KB, or disk as its buffer. \n\n{{code|MEMDISK}}, a [[RAM disk]], can use either or both RAM banks, or the base 64KB. The extra 64K can hold TRSDOS, freeing all floppy drives for data diskettes. Installing the system on RAM disk also speeds the computer's operation greatly, as system overlays load from memory rather than from disk.{{r|archer198310}} Space on a system Memdisk can be saved by omitting the file SYS0/SYS, which contains the portion of TRSDOS which is resident in RAM once the computer is booted. Users not using an Extended Command Interpreter may also omit SYS13/SYS, which is a dummy file if an ECI is not installed. A {{code|SYSRES}} command is also provided which specifies overlay modules resident in the main 64KB, permitting more free disk space on the system diskette in drive zero, which also enlarges the free space available on a system Memdisk. \n\nThe {{code|BACKUP}} utility is versatile, if sometimes confusing for beginners because of its many parameters. This is eased somewhat since its parameter structure is the same as that supported by the {{code|DIR}}ectory command, which will show the files that would be selected by {{code|BACKUP}}. It is especially capable of efficiently backing up diskettes with single-drive Model 4s, prompting the user when to switch disks in the drive. A fast mirror-image copy function (entire tracks are read and written at a time) is supported when the source and destination diskettes share like formats. This occurs automatically if the disks are alike, but a backup-by-files operation can be forced using the file wildcard character (dollar sign). This has the advantage of defragmenting files that are scattered over the disk's surface(s) in multiple extents. {{code|BACKUP}} respects the TRSDOS Allocation Flag (A Flag), which specifies the starting cylinder to be used for file copying. This capability permits the user to advantageously place frequently-accessed files (especially the system /SYS files) close to the directory cylinder, thus speeding disk I/O and reducing physical wear and tear. (The A Flag can be displayed and changed via the {{code|MEMORY}} command).\n\nOne disadvantage to {{code|BACKUP}} is the disk space it occupies: two granules, or three kilobytes on a standard floppy disk. The built-in {{code|COPY}} library command resident in SYS6/SYS provides the most frequently used capabilities, and has the advantage of supporting TRSDOS's data redirection capabilities.\n\nA FORMS filter makes tailored printouts possible for applications lacking capability for formatted printing. A keyboard filter, Keystroke Multiplier, lets the user define macro strings to the {{key press|CLEAR}} and {{key press|ALPHA}} keys. A simple (non-symbolic) machine language debugger resides in SYS5/SYS, and an extended command set for this resides in SYS9/SYS (these two files may be deleted for those users not needing the debugger). TRSDOS has an {{code|@DEBUG SVC}} available, which a programmer can insert or patch into a program to invoke the debugger under programmed control. Job Control Language serves as the equivalent to MS-DOS's batch processor. A {{code|JOBLOG}} facility records all TRSDOS commands issued. A capable terminal program, COMM/CMD, services the RS-232 serial port. TRSDOS 6, like previous versions, is supplied with a {{code|PATCH}} utility which allows non-programmers to install machine code program modifications.\n\n==== Video and Keyboard ====\nThe video display RAM and keyboard matrix are not memory-mapped as on the previous Models I and III. Rather, whenever a program called functions requiring video RAM to be modified, or the keyboard matrix to be read, TRSDOS executes code that switches out (made inaccessible) the uppermost three kilobytes from the Z80 address space (hexadecimal F400 - FFFF). This is replaced with the keyboard matrix from the address range F400 - F7FF, and the 2 KB static RAM of video memory from F800 - FFFF. The video display requires only 1920 bytes to render the 80\u00d724 text screen; the remaining memory holds the typeahead buffer and the code that accessed it. While this frees 3 KB of Z80 address space for programs, it is marginally slower than writing directly into video RAM. This banked keyboard/video address space is compatible with the external 32 KB memory banks; it is not necessary to switch in Bank 0, the Z80's upper 32KB of base memory, to access the keyboard or video memory. However, some third-party memory expansion kits do not allow this.\n\nThe monitor is significantly dimmer in 80\u00d724 mode than in 64\u00d716, as fewer scan lines draw each character.{{r|archer198310}} The video hardware supports characters in reverse video and Model I/III style block graphics. Due to the different screen resolution (640x240 pixels rather than 512x192 pixels), the block graphics characters are not of uniform height. The ten vertical pixels in each character cell are divided into three graphic blocks, the upper two of which were four pixels high, and the bottom graphics block takes the remaining two vertical pixels. These irregular graphic blocks make video games in Model 4 mode unattractive; game programmers prefer running in Model III video mode. A 40 character wide display mode is available using a double-width raster image. By manipulating the video hardware in machine code, the Model III video modes (64 and 32 character columns with 16 rows) are available as well. An alternate character set is available which included the entire Greek alphabet and special symbols. The TRSDOS 6 video driver (system device {{key press|\u2736DO}}) supports scroll protection up to seven video rows, and space compression codes. The user can change the system cursor character with the SYSTEM (BLINK) command, and user programs can change it dynamically. The system video driver provides a supervisor call, @VDCTL (video control), that permits direct manipulation of video RAM. The entire video screen, or any single row, can be copied into a buffer supplied by the caller, or the buffer can be transferred to video RAM. Though this bypasses the {{key press|\u2736DO}} display output device chain, the calling routine can fetch the SVC's address out of the SVC table and re-vector it to supply data to the display driver.\n\nOne peculiarity of the Model 4 video driver is the way ASCII carriage return characters (13 decimal or 0D hex) are handled. When this character code is sent to the {{key press|\u2736DO}} driver the system cursor is both returned to column zero and a linefeed is issued, which advances the cursor to the next line (causing the screen to scroll if the cursor was at the screen's bottom at row 23). This is contrary to other Z80 computers running the [[CP/M]] OS, and the industry-standard [[IBM PC DOS]] and [[MS-DOS]] OSes. These do not issue automatic linefeeds, which must be supplied by the software application separately. The result of this peculiarity of the Model 4 video driver is that files imported from these other OSes with single-spaced text will appear double-spaced on the Model 4 display. Many users processed text files like these with a utility that would strip out the redundant ASCII linefeed characters (10 decimal or 0A hex). In large text files this may save thousands of bytes, the reason LSI chose to handle carriage returns this way. This peculiarity also affects the way TRS-80 printers output single-spaced text imported from the other OSes. One convenience that Tandy/Radio Shack built into their own printers (DMP and DWP series) was a DIP switch to handle carriage returns either as standard TRS-80 CR+LF characters, or IBM standard carriage returns without the automatic linefeeds. Yet another effect is the display of text files with discrete CR+LF pairs received through the RS-232 serial port, usually from a remote host connected via a modem and a telephone line. Most Model 4 terminal programs have a provision for screening out redundant linefeeds before the text is sent to the {{key press|\u2736DO}} driver; for those that don't a simple filter program can be attached to the device chain to perform this task.\n\nAn optional expansion board permits the Model 4 to display 640\u00d7240 or 512\u00d7192 high-resolution monochrome graphics. The Radio Shack Model 4 hi-res graphics board sold for $249 and include a modified version of Microsoft BASIC (called BasicG) with commands for drawing basic geometric shapes and manipulating arrays in graphics RAM. The graphics screen memory is separate from the usual character screen, and the two can be displayed together or separately. Micro Labs of [[Richardson, Texas]] sold a popular compatible graphics board for $199. It comes with GBasic, its own BASIC with graphics commands. Whereas the Radio Shack board has 32KB of graphics RAM, the Micro Labs board has 20KB. Since only 19,200 bytes are required to render a 640 x 240 pixel screen, the additional RAM on the Radio Shack board is available for windowing the viewable screen around a larger virtual area. The graphics RAM is accessible through four Z80 I/O ports and is especially easy to access using the Z80 block I/O instructions for uses other than graphics. For example, the public domain utility Grafdisk adds the graphics memory to regular banked memory to create a larger TRSDOS ramdisk (96K on the Radio Shack board).\n\nThe keyboard adds {{key press|CTRL}}, {{key press|CAPS LOCK}}, and three function keys to the Model III keyboard.{{r|archer198310}} The system keyboard driver produces character codes for all the alphanumeric keys and function keys pressed in combination with the {{key press|CLEAR}} and {{key press|SHIFT|CLEAR}} keys. Though the keyboard lacks a {{key press|TAB}} key, tabbing is performed with {{key press|CLEAR|RIGHT-ARROW}}. Pausing a display, such as with {{key press|DIR}} or {{key press|LIST}}, is done with {{key press|SHIFT|@}}. As with previous TRS-80s, there is no {{key press|ESC}} key, but rather there is a dedicated {{key press|BREAK}} key which performs the same function. Special punctuation symbols such as {{key press|[}} or {{key press|{}} are entered with combinations of {{key press|CLEAR}} or {{key press|SHIFT|CLEAR}} and ordinary punctuation keys such as {{key press|(}} or {{key press|/}}. The video display can be dumped to the printer by pressing {{key press|CTRL|:}}. {{key press|CTRL|R}} repeats the last TRSDOS command. TRSDOS supports a typeahead feature with an 80 character key buffer. It uses the TRSDOS event tasker, so operations that disable Z80 interrupts (such as floppy disk access) can result in missed keystrokes.\n\n===== BASIC Programming =====\nBoth Model 4 BASIC and Model III BASIC are provided. Model 4 BASIC is largely compatible with the older language. All {{code|CMD\"A\"-\"Z\"}} functions were removed; most, not all, are available with different syntax. New features support variable names longer than two characters, {{code|WHILE...WEND}} loop structures, program chaining,{{r|archer198310}} and user defined functions ({{code|DEF FN}}). Some features from the Model III BASIC were dropped such as the ability to compress BASIC statements by omitting spaces (this feature, also found in Commodore BASIC, reduced the memory footprint of programs). It also lacks the commands for setting, resetting, and testing graphics blocks on the display.\n\nFor Model III BASIC programmers Model 4 BASIC has two disadvantages. First, variable names have to be separated from BASIC keywords with spaces, unlike Model III Disk BASIC which permits them to be run together; the Model 4 interpreter's variable names can be up to 40 characters in length, and the Model III interpreter's variable names have to be one or two characters (the interpreter accepts longer names but only the first two characters are significant for uniquely identifying the variable). The Model 4 version of BASIC therefore has to search for the delimiting space to find the end of the variable name. What this means for the programmer converting old Model III program into Model 4 BASIC is tedious editing, because Model III programmers, to save memory and speed execution, typically compact their code by using two-character variable names and eliminating spaces separating variables and keywords. The second disadvantage is that Model 4 BASIC lacks the command available in Model III BASIC for sorting arrays ({{code|CMD\"O\"}}). This is a problem for programmers maintaining code for business applications, and caused many BASIC coders to write a replacement capability or purchase third-party software. Another solution preferred by some is to continue running their programs in Model III mode under Model III BASIC, but activating the Model 4's faster speed, larger video display, and extra keys by manipulating its hardware with machine code. For those programming in languages never updated for the Model 4, this is their only option for accessing the new Model 4 features (Microsoft eventually updated its language products for the Model 4).\n\n===Reception===\nTandy sold 71,000 Model 4 computers in 1984.<ref name=\"bartimo19850311\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA28&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Tandy Revamps Product Line | work=InfoWorld | date=March 11, 1985 | accessdate=January 21, 2015 | author=Bartimo, Jim | pages=28\u201329}}</ref> ''BYTE'' in October 1983 noted the lack of native software, but praised the Model 4's backwards compatibility and TRSDOS 6's new features.

Starting from late 1984, a revised version was produced which came to be known as the Gate Array Model 4 (catalog number 26-1069A). This change greatly reduced the chip count and allows the circuitry for the Floppy Disk Controller and the RS-232 serial port to be included on the CPU board (making this new Model&nbsp;4 a single-board computer, unlike the original 26-1069). The upgrade to 128K does not require the special PAL chip available only from Radio Shack, allowing users to expand the memory themselves with third-party RAM chips. The Gate Array shipped with a green video screen instead of the black-and-white screen, and the arrow keys on the keyboard are grouped together into a single cluster (the old Model&nbsp;4 had two arrows on each side). Veteran TRS-80 game players were quite unhappy with the new arrangement of arrow keys.<ref>{{cite web |title=TRS-80 Home Page, The Model 4 \"info in Model 4 section pertains to Gate Array changes\" |url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/trs80/mirrors/kjsl/www.kjsl.com/trs80/model4info.html |website=classiccmp dot org |publisher=Pete Cervasio |accessdate=May 8, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe position of the RS-232C port's DB-25 connector was improved. On the non-gate version this points straight down at the surface on which the computer rested. The gate array's connector points directly to the computer's rear, making the cable connection much easier and reliable.\n\nAn improvement was made in the computer's speed of execution. The original Model&nbsp;4, though advertised as a 4&nbsp;MHz machine, actually performs at an effective speed of approximately 3.5&nbsp;MHz because Z80 wait states are inserted for bus transactions with the slower PAL support circuitry.<ref group=\"note\">This effective speed actually is dependent on the sort of CPU operations that are called for in the mix of machine instructions.</ref> The Gate Array CPU board allows the Tandy engineers to clock the Z80 at 4&nbsp;MHz without wait states. These make some third-party hardware modifications, particularly speedup kits, troublesome to install on the older Model 4. The support circuitry in the Gate Array version will run properly at up to 7&nbsp;MHz;<ref group=\"note\">The Model 4's Z80A is certified by Zilog for speeds up to 4&nbsp;MHz; the Z80B is recommended for speeds up to 6&nbsp;MHz (though most Z80 specimens can be overclocked some twenty percent). There was a company from the Netherlands called Seatronics that advertised an 8&nbsp;MHz upgrade using the Z80H; however very serious modifications to the Gate Array PCB, including many trace cuts, were called for.</ref> however the hardware component most affected by a faster clock rate was the keyboard. Some speedups like the XLR8er include a filter for the system \u2736KI device that inserts wait states for keyboard access only.\n\n==Model 4P==\n[[File:TRS-80 Model 4P Crop Delsener.jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model 4P]]\n\nThe Model 4P (September 1983, Radio Shack catalog number 26-1080), is a self-contained [[luggable]] unit. It has all the features of the desktop Model 4 except for the ability to add two outboard floppy disk drives and the interface for cassette tape storage (audio sent to the cassette port in Model&nbsp;III mode goes to the internal speaker). It was sold with the two internal single-sided 180KB drives. It was later made with the Gate Array technology (catalog number 26-1080A). ''80 Micro'' published an article describing a simple motherboard modification to enable the installation of two external floppy drives.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tam |first1=Tsun |title=original ''80 Micro'' article reprinted by The Misosys Quarterly Vol IV.iii Spring 1990, \"Upgrade Your 4P with External Floppy Drives\", page 27 |url=http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20IV.iii.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=80 Micro (reprinted by Roy Soltoff/Misosys Inc.) |accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 4P's CPU board lacks the Model III ROM chips containing the Model III Microsoft BASIC interpreter. Instead the computer is furnished with a floppy disk labelled \"Model&nbsp;III/A\". This is called the \"Model&nbsp;III ROM Image\" disk. If the operator wants to boot a Model&nbsp;III DOS, he inserts this disk into the boot drive after powering up. Once it is loaded, he replaces the ROM Image disk with his Model III DOS boot disk and presses reset. From then on the computer behaves exactly like a Model&nbsp;III.\n\nThe 4P's video monitor is 9\" in size compared to the Model 4's 12\". The smaller size, and sharper dots, produce better video output. The computer is compatible with popular internal Model 4 peripherals,{{r|daneliuk19831121}} and has a slot for an internal [[modem]] board. The Radio Shack modem uses its own proprietary command set and only supports communications at 300 baud. Teletrends produced a 1200 baud that uses the [[Hayes command set]].\n\nThe computer has an internal fan; its compact design does not permit it to use the Model&nbsp;4's [[passive cooling]].\n\nTandy discontinued the 4P by Spring 1985, stating that \"even though you won't find a more enthusiastic and devoted group of owners than our Model&nbsp;4P folks, transportables just weren't moving well for any company that also sold a desktop version\".<ref name=\"juge198510\">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n10/108_News_for_the_top_whats_.php | title=News for the top: what's really going on at Tandy. | work=Creative Computing | date=October 1985 | accessdate=14 October 2016 | author=Juge, Ed | pages=108}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n''[[InfoWorld]]'' in 1983 predicted that the 4P would be a \"smashing success\" as a \"substantial improvement\" on the Model 4's video and keyboard. The magazine said that it was \"truly a transportable computer\" and approved of the \"carefully thought-out mechanical design\", not too large or small. Although criticizing the computer's lack of advanced documentation or double-sided drives, ''InfoWorld'' concluded that the 4P \"is an outstanding product at an excellent price\".<ref name=\"daneliuk19831121\">{{Cite magazine |last=Daneliuk |first=Tim |date=1983-11-21 |title=Review: Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 4P |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA78&pg=PA82#v=onepage&q&f=true |magazine=InfoWorld |pages=82-83 |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Model 4D==\nThe final version of the Model 4 is the Model&nbsp;4D (Radio Shack catalog number 26-1070), first sold in 1985.

Rather than using a lever-style latch as had previous Model 4 drives, these drives use a twist-style latch that provides for more reliable clamping. They are half-height drives mounted with full-height faceplates. \n\nAn undocumented feature of these drives is that they can format 42 tracks. This technique increases the available storage on each disk to 378KB. To create such a floppy disk, the user specifies the (CYL=42) parameter on the command line when invoking {{code|FORMAT}}.<ref group=\"note\">Some of the single-sided drives built into the earlier Model 4s can also format more than 40 tracks. Since the earlier computers were sold using brands supplied by various manufacturers, this is a hit-or-miss proposition.</ref>\n\nThe [[DeskMate]] productivity suite was bundled with the 4D. It supplies simple applications including a word processor, filer, spreadsheet, calendar, and mail manager.\n\nModel 4Ds sold during 1987 and later shipped with an updated version of its operating system, now called LS-DOS 6.3 after its third-party developer Logical Systems.<ref group=\"note\">The Model 4's original TRSDOS 6.0 was progressively updated through to the definitive version 6.2. When introduced in 1985, the Model&nbsp;4D was distributed with version 6.2.1, which modified the FORMAT command to default to double-sided disks.

Another useful feature modifies the BASIC interpreter to access LS-DOS Supervisor Calls using integer variables, without having to resort to high memory subroutines coded in Z80 assembler. BASIC commands like {{code|LIST}}, {{code|EDIT}}, and {{code|PRINT}} are accessible via single keystrokes. Also added in LS-DOS&nbsp;6.3 is the {{code|TED/CMD}} simple text editor. The TRSDOS non-interactive {{code|BUILD}} command had previously been the only method of creating plain text files. {{code|TED}} occupies only 3KB of disk space while offering full-screen cursor movement and block capabilities, as well as search-and-replace.<ref group=\"note\">In 1990 Misosys Inc, which had taken over maintenance from LSI, released the last version of LS-DOS, 6.3.1, which added a few enhanced features.{{cite web |title=Misosys Quarterly Vol IV.iii Spring 1990 front cover |url=http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20IV.iii.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=Roy Soltoff, Misosys Inc. |accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLater Misosys, Inc. updated LS-DOS 6.3 to support dates through December 31, 2011 (as well as a few other enhancements).

The Model 4's case also switched from spray-painted translucent plastic to molded plastic, ensuring that the coloring is not vulnerable to peeling or rubbing.\n\nThe Model 4 uses WD1770/1773 floppy controllers instead of the WD1791, which allows for a larger gap between the index hole and first sector; later releases of TRSDOS and LDOS were modified for compatibility with the controller.\n\nThe Model 4 shipped with [[TRSDOS]] 6, identical to Logical Systems's LDOS 6.00 third-party [[operating system]] (itself an enhancement to older versions of TRSDOS). When the Model 4 boots into TRSDOS 6, the video display switches into 80\u00d724 mode and the entire 64KB address space is mapped as RAM. \n\nWhen booted from a Model III operating system disk, the Model 4 enters 64\u00d716 video mode and maps Model III ROMs from address zero, making it capable of running Model III software. Model 4 features can be accessed in Model III mode by manipulating the computer's hardware ports. The LDOS 5.3 update supports SYSTEM (FAST) to enable the Model 4's 4 MHz clock speed.

It has a utility for reading and writing CP/M disk formats of many other brands of computer. \n\nOne notable program available only for the Model 4 was marketed by Radio Shack as '''DoubleDuty'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1985_rsc-12/h027.html|title=First appearance of DDuty in RS Computer Catalog RSC-12 page 27, 1985|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}</ref> This is one of the first [[context switch|task-switching]] programs available for any microcomputer. It uses the upper 64KB of a 128KB machine to keep resident a second TRSDOS application, which can be switched instantly with another application loaded into the main 64KB. A third partition is available for TRSDOS library commands, such as DIR. DoubleDuty first appeared in Radio Shack's 1985 Computer Catalog (RSC-12), the same year that IBM's [[Topview]], Apple's Switcher, and Quarterdeck's [[DESQview]] first became available. DoubleDuty was written by Randy Cook, the author of the first version of TRSDOS for the original Model I.\n\nThe Model 4's memory mapping and OS more closely resemble the TRS-80 Model II than it does the Model III. Like the Model II, there is no ROM-based OS and all OS software was RAM-resident and loaded from disk at bootup. There is only a small boot loader ROM which checks for the presence of a Model 4 OS disk and if one is not detected, it defaults to Model III mode. Also like the Model II, the OS uses vectored API calls instead of absolute addresses, and software developers were encouraged to use the API calls rather than low-level hardware access to ensure compatibility with future iterations of TRSDOS 6.<ref group=\"note\">The term \"API\" is one used by other computer systems. On the Model 4 applications interface with the DOS via \"Supervisor Calls\"; on the Models I/III direct Z80 machine language Z80 CALL instructions are issued to absolute addresses in ROM. On the Model 4 the Z80 accumulator is loaded with the SVC number and a RST 40 instruction is issued. TRSDOS uses the SVC number to index into a jump table maintained in low memory. This is obviously an advantage because it enables the programmer to revector SVCs to customized service routines.</ref>\n\nRather than accessing the memory-mapped keyboard and video directly as on the Models I and III, TRSDOS SVCs are used. This method permits I/O redirection over all the computer's devices, including the disk drives. This makes possible, for example, to \"print\" a document to a disk file so it can be printed at a later time. Another frequent use of I/O redirection is redirecting video output to the printer for permanent hardcopy of a program run. TRSDOS supplies the {{code|LINK}}, {{code|ROUTE}}, and {{code|FILTER}} commands to enable these capabilities. This method also ensures consistent communication between memory resident modules attached to the OS's logical devices. Some applications programmers, however, circumvent this device-independent approach by physically accessing the computer hardware, such as Radio Shack's SuperScripsit word processor; its programmers insisted on having the CTL255 routine built into the keyboard driver expressly for this purpose. Another offender was Anitek Software's Lescript. These two applications ignore any filter programs attached to the keyboard device, depriving the user of some [[terminate and stay resident program]]s, such as Misosys' Sidekick-like Pro-WAM Window Application Manager, as well as the TRSDOS KSM/FLT keystroke multiplier macro facility.\n\nThe disk drives are identical to the Model III, consisting of one or two single-sided full-height 5.25\" drives (various brands of disk drive were used in the Model 4, while the Model III had exclusively Tandons), providing 180KB of storage with TRSDOS. An additional two drives can connect via the external floppy port. Any floppy drive with the Shugart-style 34-pin interface can be used; thus it is possible to upgrade a Model 4 to use double-sided, 80 track, or even 3.5\" 720 KB (low density) floppies. Drive select is implemented via the card edge connectors for the drives; the connector for each drive bay has certain conductors missing that identify the lower drive as system drive zero, and the upper drive as system drive one. Thus the drives do not have drive select jumpers, and are identical. This makes the drives in a dual drive Model 4 interchangeable. Replacement with third-party double-sided drives requires use of a new drive cable and connectors with all conductors present; in this case drive select is made with jumpers on the drives.\n\nExternal hard disks were available using the computer's 50 pin expansion card-edge, which also permit other external hardware requiring direct access to the Z80 buses. These include Atari style joystick adapters or the line of data acquisition devices marketed by Alpha Products. A parallel printer can be added using another card-edge connector provided for this purpose. An RS-232 serial port was optional on the original versions of the Model 4.\n\nThe baseline Model 4 uses a 16kx1 DRAM known as the 8040517. This chip, also used in 16k TRS-80 CoCo 2s, is functionally identical to a 4116 DRAM, but only uses +5V power instead of the 4116's tri-voltage power. 64k and 128k models use standard 4164 DRAMs. Unlike previous machines, the RS-232 port is standard equipment rather than an extra cost option. The RS-232 and printer ports are also moved to the back instead of the underside of the computer, making them more easily accessible.\n\nThe Model 4 was announced in the same press release (April 1983) as was the [[TRS-80 Model 100]] laptop. The two computers were often marketed by Tandy/Radio Shack as a complementary pair. Model 100 cassette tapes are readable on the Model 4 with its cassette interface and a TRSDOS 6 utility called TAPE100/CMD, which store Model 100 programs and data as TRSDOS disk files. Programs and files can be transferred back and forth via an RS-232 serial null modem cable, or over a telephone line using a modem on the Model 4 end (the Model 100 has a built-in modem). Both the Model 4 and the Model 100 came with terminal software as a built-in feature.\n\nEarly versions of the Model 4 mainboard were designed to accept a [[Zilog Z800]] 16 bit CPU upgrade board to replace the Z80 8 bit CPU but this option was never released. In 1987 H.I. Tech produced an enhanced CPU board, the '''XLR8er''', using the [[Hitachi HD64180]] Z80-compatible processor. It runs with a 6.144 MHz clock rate and adds 256KB of memory that could be used as a RAM disk. When combined with the upper 64KB of Model 4 banked RAM, a ramdisk of up to 384KB can be mounted. Later, software was developed that can access XLR8er RAM as standard TRSDOS 32KB banks through the @BANK supervisor call. This makes the extra memory accessible to standard TRSDOS applications coded to use banked RAM. The Hitachi CPU also executes many Z80 instructions in fewer clock cycles than the Zilog chip; 8Mhz performance was claimed but in reality most software realize a performance improvement of only 25 to 30 percent.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions are programs that made heavy use of the Z80 block instructions like LDIR and CPIR. This group of instructions take 21 transition states per iteration to execute on a Z80; on the HD64180 they take only 14. These sorts of programs realize an effective peak clock speed of 9 megahertz (112.5% speedup) on the XLR8er. Since the TRSDOS video driver uses LDIR to scroll the video display, screen scrolling is especially snappy with the XLR8er. Enthusiast created programs can access the 64180's [[Direct Memory Access|DMA]] channels to attain an even higher rate of data transfer. {{cite web |title=The Misosys Quarterly Vol VI.i Autumn 1991, \"The Final Solution to the XLR8er Question\" by J.F.R. \"Frank\" Slinkman, page 33 |url=http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20VI.i.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=Roy Soltoff/Misosys Inc. |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Model 4 include a sound generator, a first for the TRS-80 line as the Model I/III require the user to output sounds to the cassette port, which is then connected to a stereo amplifier for sound output. However its sound capabilities are extremely limited, with just seven tones that can be produced, ranging from C to G\u266d on the musical scale, and there is no E. Each tone had 32 different durations it can be sounded for. TRSDOS includes a filter program, {{code|CLICK/FLT}}, that beeps the speaker each time a key was pressed, to provide audible feedback for the typist. One Radio Shack spokesman described the Model 4's sound generator as \"being intended for business alerts\".\n\n===== TRSDOS 6 Features =====\n\nTRSDOS 6 provides utilities and filters for the Model 4's new hardware features.<ref group=\"note\">LDOS 5.x in Model III mode supports most all TRSDOS 6 features described here. The two most obvious exceptions are MEMDISK and SPOOL.</ref>\n\n{{code|SPOOL}}, a [[print spooler]] that runs as a background task while other applications are in use, can use the extra 64KB RAM, base 64KB, or disk as its buffer. \n\n{{code|MEMDISK}}, a [[RAM disk]], can use either or both RAM banks, or the base 64KB. The extra 64K can hold TRSDOS, freeing all floppy drives for data diskettes. Installing the system on RAM disk also speeds the computer's operation greatly, as system overlays load from memory rather than from disk.{{r|archer198310}} Space on a system Memdisk can be saved by omitting the file SYS0/SYS, which contains the portion of TRSDOS which is resident in RAM once the computer is booted. Users not using an Extended Command Interpreter may also omit SYS13/SYS, which is a dummy file if an ECI is not installed. A {{code|SYSRES}} command is also provided which specifies overlay modules resident in the main 64KB, permitting more free disk space on the system diskette in drive zero, which also enlarges the free space available on a system Memdisk. \n\nThe {{code|BACKUP}} utility is versatile, if sometimes confusing for beginners because of its many parameters. This is eased somewhat since its parameter structure is the same as that supported by the {{code|DIR}}ectory command, which will show the files that would be selected by {{code|BACKUP}}. It is especially capable of efficiently backing up diskettes with single-drive Model 4s, prompting the user when to switch disks in the drive. A fast mirror-image copy function (entire tracks are read and written at a time) is supported when the source and destination diskettes share like formats. This occurs automatically if the disks are alike, but a backup-by-files operation can be forced using the file wildcard character (dollar sign). This has the advantage of defragmenting files that are scattered over the disk's surface(s) in multiple extents. {{code|BACKUP}} respects the TRSDOS Allocation Flag (A Flag), which specifies the starting cylinder to be used for file copying. This capability permits the user to advantageously place frequently-accessed files (especially the system /SYS files) close to the directory cylinder, thus speeding disk I/O and reducing physical wear and tear. (The A Flag can be displayed and changed via the {{code|MEMORY}} command).\n\nOne disadvantage to {{code|BACKUP}} is the disk space it occupies: two granules, or three kilobytes on a standard floppy disk. The built-in {{code|COPY}} library command resident in SYS6/SYS provides the most frequently used capabilities, and has the advantage of supporting TRSDOS's data redirection capabilities.\n\nA FORMS filter makes tailored printouts possible for applications lacking capability for formatted printing. A keyboard filter, Keystroke Multiplier, lets the user define macro strings to the {{key press|CLEAR}} and {{key press|ALPHA}} keys. A simple (non-symbolic) machine language debugger resides in SYS5/SYS, and an extended command set for this resides in SYS9/SYS (these two files may be deleted for those users not needing the debugger). TRSDOS has an {{code|@DEBUG SVC}} available, which a programmer can insert or patch into a program to invoke the debugger under programmed control. Job Control Language serves as the equivalent to MS-DOS's batch processor. A {{code|JOBLOG}} facility records all TRSDOS commands issued. A capable terminal program, COMM/CMD, services the RS-232 serial port. TRSDOS 6, like previous versions, is supplied with a {{code|PATCH}} utility which allows non-programmers to install machine code program modifications.\n\n==== Video and Keyboard ====\nThe video display RAM and keyboard matrix are not memory-mapped as on the previous Models I and III. Rather, whenever a program called functions requiring video RAM to be modified, or the keyboard matrix to be read, TRSDOS executes code that switches out (made inaccessible) the uppermost three kilobytes from the Z80 address space (hexadecimal F400 - FFFF). This is replaced with the keyboard matrix from the address range F400 - F7FF, and the 2 KB static RAM of video memory from F800 - FFFF. The video display requires only 1920 bytes to render the 80\u00d724 text screen; the remaining memory holds the typeahead buffer and the code that accessed it. While this frees 3 KB of Z80 address space for programs, it is marginally slower than writing directly into video RAM. This banked keyboard/video address space is compatible with the external 32 KB memory banks; it is not necessary to switch in Bank 0, the Z80's upper 32KB of base memory, to access the keyboard or video memory. However, some third-party memory expansion kits do not allow this.\n\nThe monitor is significantly dimmer in 80\u00d724 mode than in 64\u00d716, as fewer scan lines draw each character.{{r|archer198310}} The video hardware supports characters in reverse video and Model I/III style block graphics. Due to the different screen resolution (640x240 pixels rather than 512x192 pixels), the block graphics characters are not of uniform height. The ten vertical pixels in each character cell are divided into three graphic blocks, the upper two of which were four pixels high, and the bottom graphics block takes the remaining two vertical pixels. These irregular graphic blocks make video games in Model 4 mode unattractive; game programmers prefer running in Model III video mode. A 40 character wide display mode is available using a double-width raster image. By manipulating the video hardware in machine code, the Model III video modes (64 and 32 character columns with 16 rows) are available as well. An alternate character set is available which included the entire Greek alphabet and special symbols. The TRSDOS 6 video driver (system device {{key press|\u2736DO}}) supports scroll protection up to seven video rows, and space compression codes. The user can change the system cursor character with the SYSTEM (BLINK) command, and user programs can change it dynamically. The system video driver provides a supervisor call, @VDCTL (video control), that permits direct manipulation of video RAM. The entire video screen, or any single row, can be copied into a buffer supplied by the caller, or the buffer can be transferred to video RAM. Though this bypasses the {{key press|\u2736DO}} display output device chain, the calling routine can fetch the SVC's address out of the SVC table and re-vector it to supply data to the display driver.\n\nOne peculiarity of the Model 4 video driver is the way ASCII carriage return characters (13 decimal or 0D hex) are handled. When this character code is sent to the {{key press|\u2736DO}} driver the system cursor is both returned to column zero and a linefeed is issued, which advances the cursor to the next line (causing the screen to scroll if the cursor was at the screen's bottom at row 23). This is contrary to other Z80 computers running the [[CP/M]] OS, and the industry-standard [[IBM PC DOS]] and [[MS-DOS]] OSes. These do not issue automatic linefeeds, which must be supplied by the software application separately. The result of this peculiarity of the Model 4 video driver is that files imported from these other OSes with single-spaced text will appear double-spaced on the Model 4 display. Many users processed text files like these with a utility that would strip out the redundant ASCII linefeed characters (10 decimal or 0A hex). In large text files this may save thousands of bytes, the reason LSI chose to handle carriage returns this way. This peculiarity also affects the way TRS-80 printers output single-spaced text imported from the other OSes. One convenience that Tandy/Radio Shack built into their own printers (DMP and DWP series) was a DIP switch to handle carriage returns either as standard TRS-80 CR+LF characters, or IBM standard carriage returns without the automatic linefeeds. Yet another effect is the display of text files with discrete CR+LF pairs received through the RS-232 serial port, usually from a remote host connected via a modem and a telephone line. Most Model 4 terminal programs have a provision for screening out redundant linefeeds before the text is sent to the {{key press|\u2736DO}} driver; for those that don't a simple filter program can be attached to the device chain to perform this task.\n\nAn optional expansion board permits the Model 4 to display 640\u00d7240 or 512\u00d7192 high-resolution monochrome graphics. The Radio Shack Model 4 hi-res graphics board sold for $249 and include a modified version of Microsoft BASIC (called BasicG) with commands for drawing basic geometric shapes and manipulating arrays in graphics RAM. The graphics screen memory is separate from the usual character screen, and the two can be displayed together or separately. Micro Labs of [[Richardson, Texas]] sold a popular compatible graphics board for $199. It comes with GBasic, its own BASIC with graphics commands. Whereas the Radio Shack board has 32KB of graphics RAM, the Micro Labs board has 20KB. Since only 19,200 bytes are required to render a 640 x 240 pixel screen, the additional RAM on the Radio Shack board is available for windowing the viewable screen around a larger virtual area. The graphics RAM is accessible through four Z80 I/O ports and is especially easy to access using the Z80 block I/O instructions for uses other than graphics. For example, the public domain utility Grafdisk adds the graphics memory to regular banked memory to create a larger TRSDOS ramdisk (96K on the Radio Shack board).\n\nThe keyboard adds {{key press|CTRL}}, {{key press|CAPS LOCK}}, and three function keys to the Model III keyboard.{{r|archer198310}} The system keyboard driver produces character codes for all the alphanumeric keys and function keys pressed in combination with the {{key press|CLEAR}} and {{key press|SHIFT|CLEAR}} keys. Though the keyboard lacks a {{key press|TAB}} key, tabbing is performed with {{key press|CLEAR|RIGHT-ARROW}}. Pausing a display, such as with {{key press|DIR}} or {{key press|LIST}}, is done with {{key press|SHIFT|@}}. As with previous TRS-80s, there is no {{key press|ESC}} key, but rather there is a dedicated {{key press|BREAK}} key which performs the same function. Special punctuation symbols such as {{key press|[}} or {{key press|{}} are entered with combinations of {{key press|CLEAR}} or {{key press|SHIFT|CLEAR}} and ordinary punctuation keys such as {{key press|(}} or {{key press|/}}. The video display can be dumped to the printer by pressing {{key press|CTRL|:}}. {{key press|CTRL|R}} repeats the last TRSDOS command. TRSDOS supports a typeahead feature with an 80 character key buffer. It uses the TRSDOS event tasker, so operations that disable Z80 interrupts (such as floppy disk access) can result in missed keystrokes.\n\n===== BASIC Programming =====\nBoth Model 4 BASIC and Model III BASIC are provided. Model 4 BASIC is largely compatible with the older language. All {{code|CMD\"A\"-\"Z\"}} functions were removed; most, not all, are available with different syntax. New features support variable names longer than two characters, {{code|WHILE...WEND}} loop structures, program chaining,{{r|archer198310}} and user defined functions ({{code|DEF FN}}). Some features from the Model III BASIC were dropped such as the ability to compress BASIC statements by omitting spaces (this feature, also found in Commodore BASIC, reduced the memory footprint of programs). It also lacks the commands for setting, resetting, and testing graphics blocks on the display.\n\nFor Model III BASIC programmers Model 4 BASIC has two disadvantages. First, variable names have to be separated from BASIC keywords with spaces, unlike Model III Disk BASIC which permits them to be run together; the Model 4 interpreter's variable names can be up to 40 characters in length, and the Model III interpreter's variable names have to be one or two characters (the interpreter accepts longer names but only the first two characters are significant for uniquely identifying the variable). The Model 4 version of BASIC therefore has to search for the delimiting space to find the end of the variable name. What this means for the programmer converting old Model III program into Model 4 BASIC is tedious editing, because Model III programmers, to save memory and speed execution, typically compact their code by using two-character variable names and eliminating spaces separating variables and keywords. The second disadvantage is that Model 4 BASIC lacks the command available in Model III BASIC for sorting arrays ({{code|CMD\"O\"}}). This is a problem for programmers maintaining code for business applications, and caused many BASIC coders to write a replacement capability or purchase third-party software. Another solution preferred by some is to continue running their programs in Model III mode under Model III BASIC, but activating the Model 4's faster speed, larger video display, and extra keys by manipulating its hardware with machine code. For those programming in languages never updated for the Model 4, this is their only option for accessing the new Model 4 features (Microsoft eventually updated its language products for the Model 4).\n\n===Reception===\nTandy sold 71,000 Model 4 computers in 1984.<ref name=\"bartimo19850311\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA28&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Tandy Revamps Product Line | work=InfoWorld | date=March 11, 1985 | accessdate=January 21, 2015 | author=Bartimo, Jim | pages=28\u201329}}</ref> ''BYTE'' in October 1983 noted the lack of native software, but praised the Model 4's backwards compatibility and TRSDOS 6's new features.

Starting from late 1984, a revised version was produced which came to be known as the Gate Array Model 4 (catalog number 26-1069A). This change greatly reduced the chip count and allows the circuitry for the Floppy Disk Controller and the RS-232 serial port to be included on the CPU board (making this new Model&nbsp;4 a single-board computer, unlike the original 26-1069). The upgrade to 128K does not require the special PAL chip available only from Radio Shack, allowing users to expand the memory themselves with third-party RAM chips. The Gate Array shipped with a green video screen instead of the black-and-white screen, and the arrow keys on the keyboard are grouped together into a single cluster (the old Model&nbsp;4 had two arrows on each side). Veteran TRS-80 game players were quite unhappy with the new arrangement of arrow keys.<ref>{{cite web |title=TRS-80 Home Page, The Model 4 \"info in Model 4 section pertains to Gate Array changes\" |url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/trs80/mirrors/kjsl/www.kjsl.com/trs80/model4info.html |website=classiccmp dot org |publisher=Pete Cervasio |accessdate=May 8, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe position of the RS-232C port's DB-25 connector was improved. On the non-gate version this points straight down at the surface on which the computer rested. The gate array's connector points directly to the computer's rear, making the cable connection much easier and reliable.\n\nAn improvement was made in the computer's speed of execution. The original Model&nbsp;4, though advertised as a 4&nbsp;MHz machine, actually performs at an effective speed of approximately 3.5&nbsp;MHz because Z80 wait states are inserted for bus transactions with the slower PAL support circuitry.<ref group=\"note\">This effective speed actually is dependent on the sort of CPU operations that are called for in the mix of machine instructions.</ref> The Gate Array CPU board allows the Tandy engineers to clock the Z80 at 4&nbsp;MHz without wait states. These make some third-party hardware modifications, particularly speedup kits, troublesome to install on the older Model 4. The support circuitry in the Gate Array version will run properly at up to 7&nbsp;MHz;<ref group=\"note\">The Model 4's Z80A is certified by Zilog for speeds up to 4&nbsp;MHz; the Z80B is recommended for speeds up to 6&nbsp;MHz (though most Z80 specimens can be overclocked some twenty percent). There was a company from the Netherlands called Seatronics that advertised an 8&nbsp;MHz upgrade using the Z80H; however very serious modifications to the Gate Array PCB, including many trace cuts, were called for.</ref> however the hardware component most affected by a faster clock rate was the keyboard. Some speedups like the XLR8er include a filter for the system \u2736KI device that inserts wait states for keyboard access only.\n\n==Model 4P==\n[[File:TRS-80 Model 4P Crop Delsener.jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model 4P]]\n\nThe Model 4P (September 1983, Radio Shack catalog number 26-1080), is a self-contained [[luggable]] unit. It has all the features of the desktop Model 4 except for the ability to add two outboard floppy disk drives and the interface for cassette tape storage (audio sent to the cassette port in Model&nbsp;III mode goes to the internal speaker). It was sold with the two internal single-sided 180KB drives. It was later made with the Gate Array technology (catalog number 26-1080A). ''80 Micro'' published an article describing a simple motherboard modification to enable the installation of two external floppy drives.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tam |first1=Tsun |title=original ''80 Micro'' article reprinted by The Misosys Quarterly Vol IV.iii Spring 1990, \"Upgrade Your 4P with External Floppy Drives\", page 27 |url=http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20IV.iii.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=80 Micro (reprinted by Roy Soltoff/Misosys Inc.) |accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 4P's CPU board lacks the Model III ROM chips containing the Model III Microsoft BASIC interpreter. Instead the computer is furnished with a floppy disk labelled \"Model&nbsp;III/A\". This is called the \"Model&nbsp;III ROM Image\" disk. If the operator wants to boot a Model&nbsp;III DOS, he inserts this disk into the boot drive after powering up. Once it is loaded, he replaces the ROM Image disk with his Model III DOS boot disk and presses reset. From then on the computer behaves exactly like a Model&nbsp;III.\n\nThe 4P's video monitor is 9\" in size compared to the Model 4's 12\". The smaller size, and sharper dots, produce better video output. The computer is compatible with popular internal Model 4 peripherals,{{r|daneliuk19831121}} and has a slot for an internal [[modem]] board. The Radio Shack modem uses its own proprietary command set and only supports communications at 300 baud. Teletrends produced a 1200 baud that uses the [[Hayes command set]].\n\nThe computer has an internal fan; its compact design does not permit it to use the Model&nbsp;4's [[passive cooling]].\n\nTandy discontinued the 4P by Spring 1985, stating that \"even though you won't find a more enthusiastic and devoted group of owners than our Model&nbsp;4P folks, transportables just weren't moving well for any company that also sold a desktop version\".<ref name=\"juge198510\">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n10/108_News_for_the_top_whats_.php | title=News for the top: what's really going on at Tandy. | work=Creative Computing | date=October 1985 | accessdate=14 October 2016 | author=Juge, Ed | pages=108}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n''[[InfoWorld]]''' in 1983 predicted that the 4P would be a \"smashing success\" as a \"substantial improvement\" on the Model 4's video and keyboard. The magazine said that it was \"truly a transportable computer\" and approved of the \"carefully thought-out mechanical design\", not too large or small. Although criticizing the computer's lack of advanced documentation or double-sided drives, ''InfoWorld'' concluded that the 4P \"is an outstanding product at an excellent price\".<ref name=\"daneliuk19831121\">{{Cite magazine |last=Daneliuk |first=Tim |date=1983-11-21 |title=Review: Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 4P |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA78&pg=PA82#v=onepage&q&f=true |magazine=InfoWorld |pages=82-83 |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Model 4D==\nThe final version of the Model 4 is the Model&nbsp;4D (Radio Shack catalog number 26-1070), first sold in 1985.

Rather than using a lever-style latch as had previous Model 4 drives, these drives use a twist-style latch that provides for more reliable clamping. They are half-height drives mounted with full-height faceplates. \n\nAn undocumented feature of these drives is that they can format 42 tracks. This technique increases the available storage on each disk to 378KB. To create such a floppy disk, the user specifies the (CYL=42) parameter on the command line when invoking {{code|FORMAT}}.<ref group=\"note\">Some of the single-sided drives built into the earlier Model 4s can also format more than 40 tracks. Since the earlier computers were sold using brands supplied by various manufacturers, this is a hit-or-miss proposition.</ref>\n\nThe [[DeskMate]] productivity suite was bundled with the 4D. It supplies simple applications including a word processor, filer, spreadsheet, calendar, and mail manager.\n\nModel 4Ds sold during 1987 and later shipped with an updated version of its operating system, now called LS-DOS 6.3 after its third-party developer Logical Systems.<ref group=\"note\">The Model 4's original TRSDOS 6.0 was progressively updated through to the definitive version 6.2. When introduced in 1985, the Model&nbsp;4D was distributed with version 6.2.1, which modified the FORMAT command to default to double-sided disks. Versions earlier than 6.2.1 can format double-sided drives using the paramter SIDES=2.{{cite web |title=1985 Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-12 page 28 |url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1985_rsc-12/h028.html |website=radioshackcatalogs dot com |publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack |accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> It provides many enhanced features, the most important of which is the ability to handle file dates through December 31, 1999.

Another useful feature modifies the BASIC interpreter to access LS-DOS Supervisor Calls using integer variables, without having to resort to high memory subroutines coded in Z80 assembler. BASIC commands like {{code|LIST}}, {{code|EDIT}}, and {{code|PRINT}} are accessible via single keystrokes. Also added in LS-DOS&nbsp;6.3 is the {{code|TED/CMD}} simple text editor. The TRSDOS non-interactive {{code|BUILD}} command had previously been the only method of creating plain text files. {{code|TED}} occupies only 3KB of disk space while offering full-screen cursor movement and block capabilities, as well as search-and-replace.<ref group=\"note\">In 1990 Misosys Inc, which had taken over maintenance from LSI, released the last version of LS-DOS, 6.3.1, which added a few enhanced features.{{cite web |title=Misosys Quarterly Vol IV.iii Spring 1990 front cover |url=http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20IV.iii.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=Roy Soltoff, Misosys Inc. |accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLater Misosys, Inc. updated LS-DOS 6.3 to support dates through December 31, 2011 (as well as a few other enhancements).

It is not branded as a Radio Shack product, however. The badge mounted on its front cover brands it as the \"Tandy TRS-80 Model 4D\". This change in marketing resulted from Tandy corporation's desire to enhance its stature in the marketplace, because it was perceived by some in the computer press that the old \"Radio Shack\" moniker connoted an image of inferior quality. The Model&nbsp;4D is the last computer to bear the \"TRS-80\" name. It retailed for $1199 at its introduction in 1985.

{"title_page": "Elective monarchy", "text_new": "{{short description|Monarchy ruled by an elected monarch}}\n{{more citations needed| date= April 2016}}\n{{Monarchism |expanded=types}}\nAn '''elective monarchy''' is a [[monarchy]] ruled by an [[election|elected]] monarch, in contrast to a [[hereditary monarchy]] in which the office is automatically passed down as a family inheritance. The manner of election, the nature of candidate qualifications, and the electors vary from case to case. Historically it is not uncommon for elective monarchies to transform into hereditary ones over time, or for hereditary ones to acquire at least occasional elective aspects.\n\nWELL THEN IM CRISTIANO RONALDO :/ I MEAN I TRY SO HARDS CUZ IM FKRI fgwEFEVF rghbfyusdf nEYMAR WILL NEVER DO THAT\n\n==Historical examples==\n===Europe===\n====Ancient Greece====\nThe kings of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] and of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] of the ''[[Athenian democracy#Etymology|Demos]]'', the assembly of all free [[classical Athens|Athenian]] citizens. Military service often was linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house.\n\n====Rome / Byzantium ====\nIn the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]], the kings were elected by the [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]]. Once the Roman kings were overthrown, there remained an absolute prohibition for royal establishment in the Roman constitution, a prohibition which formally remained in place during imperial times, both classical [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]. In practice, however, Imperial Rome was a monarchy.  During the [[Principate]] (27BCE to 284CE), which was the foundational stage of Roman emperorship, Roman monarchs would often take care to disguise their de facto position with the de jure apparatus of republicanism.  This was particularly the case for [[Augustus]], the first Emperor, who established the Principate.  Whilst given many titles (including \"Augustus\", i.e. \"majestic\") he described himself as \"princeps senatus\", or merely \"first among senators\".  The illusion of being elected from the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] continued when Tiberius succeeded to the purple.  Whilst over time the principle weakened as [[Roman Republic|republican government]] passed into distant history to the effect that the Empire became, functionally, an absolute monarchy the office of Roman and Byzantine emperor remained vaguely elective (albeit with the election procedure never strictly defined, but generally understood to be a matter for the Senate).  For instance, whilst the first five Emperors were all [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|descended from Julius Caesar]], in each case their position was proclaimed, not inherited as of right.  [[Claudius]], the fourth Emperor, in particular stands out, being \"elected\" to office once the [[Praetorian Guard]] had made it clear he was their candidate.\n\nAccordingly, heredity never was, and could never be, formally established in law. And whilst the later, more overtly authoritarian [[Dominate]] period further stripped the republican veneer from the constitution, Emperors succeeded by a mixture of proclamation by the Legions or Senate as much as by blood (though sons did succeed fathers).\n\nIn order to bypass the prohibition on heredity and ensure dynastic continuity, many reigning Byzantine emperors had their heirs crowned co-emperor so that the throne could not be considered vacant at their own death and thus the need for succession by election would not arise.\n\n====Holy Roman Empire====\n{{Further|Imperial election}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] is perhaps the best-known example of an elective monarchy. However, from 1440 to 1740, a Habsburg was always elected [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]], the throne becoming unofficially hereditary.<ref name=\"The Emperor: Qualifications\"/> During that period, the emperor was elected from within the [[House of Habsburg]] by a small council of nobles called [[prince-elector]]s. The secular electoral seats were hereditary.  However, spiritual electors (and other prince-(arch)bishops) were usually elected by the [[cathedral chapter]]s as religious leaders, but simultaneously ruled as monarch (prince) of a territory of [[imperial immediacy]] (which usually comprised a part of their diocesan territory). Thus the [[prince-bishopric]]s were elective monarchies too. The same holds true for prince-abbacies, whose princess-abbesses or [[prince-abbot]]s were elected by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of clerics and imperially appointed as princely rulers in a pertaining territory.\n\n====Kingdom of Jerusalem====\nIn the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the kingship was partially elected and partially hereditary. During the height of the kingdom in the mid-12th century there was a royal family and a relatively clear line of succession. Nevertheless, the king was elected, or at least recognized, by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]. Here the king was considered a ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (first among equals), and in his absence his duties were performed by his [[officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|seneschal]].\n\n====Scandinavia====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nOriginally, the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Kings of Sweden]] were elected by all free men at the [[Stones of Mora|Mora]] [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]. Elective monarchy continued until 1544, when the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] designated the [[House of Vasa|heirs]] of King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] as the heirs to the throne. The [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish monarchy]] was also officially elective, although the eldest son of the reigning monarch was usually elected. This continued until 1660, when a hereditary and [[absolute monarchy]] was instituted by [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]]. Though the [[monarchy of Norway]] was originally hereditary, it too became elective in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Candidates had to be of royal blood, but the kingship was elected by a council of noblemen, rather than automatically passing to the eldest son. In 1905 [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Carl]] was elected King of Norway, after the male population in an election decided Norway should still be a monarchy.\n\nThe Scandinavian kingdoms were united under the Danish crown by [[Margaret I of Denmark]] in 1389, but many of her successors had the united kingdoms split up as Sweden elected a different king than Denmark and Norway upon succession. The election was usually contested through a Danish invasion of Sweden until [[Christian II of Denmark]] after his reconquest of Sweden had all those voting against him executed in the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] (1520), which ended all support for the Danish king on the Swedish throne.\n\nIn 1810, the Swedish [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] elected the French Marshall [[Jean Bernadotte]] to be the new [[Crown Prince]], since it was apparent that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]]. Bernadotte eventually ascended the throne as [[Charles XIV John of Sweden]] and founded the still current [[House of Bernadotte]]. In this case the elective aspect in the choice of Monarch was especially prominent, since Bernadotte was a French commoner with no previous connection to Sweden and not the most remote of dynastic claims to the Swedish throne \u2013 his being chosen derived solely from urgent political and military considerations of the crisis time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n====Poland-Lithuania====\n{{main|Royal elections in Poland}}\n[[File:Potega Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu Zlota wolnosc Elekcja 1573.JPG|thumb|300px|right|''The Republic at the Zenith of Its Power. [[Golden Liberty]]. The [[Royal elections in Poland|Royal Election]] of 1573'', by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\nIn [[Poland]], after the death of the last [[Piast]] in 1370, Polish kings were initially elected by a small council; gradually, this privilege was granted to all members of the ''[[szlachta]]'' (Polish nobility). Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania during the times of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569\u20131795) were elected by gatherings of crowds of nobles at a field in [[Wola]], today a neighbourhood of [[Warsaw]]. Since in Poland all sons of a noble were nobles, and not only the eldest, every one of an estimated 500,000 nobles could potentially have participated in such elections in person \u2013 by far the widest franchise of any European country at the time. During the election period, the function of the king was performed by an [[Interrex (Poland)|interrex]] (usually in the person of the [[primate of Poland]]). This unique Polish election was termed the [[Free election (Polish throne)|free election]] (''wolna elekcja'').\n\n====Bohemia====\n\nSince medieval times, the [[King of Bohemia]] was elected by the [[Estate (land)|Estate]]s of [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. Since 1526, when the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] assumed the Bohemian Crown, it was always held by the [[Habsburg]]s, who expected this situation to go on indefinitely. In 1618 the Bohemians chose to exercise in practice their legal right to choose a King at their discretion, and bestowed the Bohemian Crown on [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] \u2013 \"The Winter King\". However, the Habsburgs regarded this as an act of rebellion, imposed their rule over Bohemia in the [[Battle of the White Mountain]] and in the aftermath abolished the Bohemian Elective Monarchy and made exclusive Habsburg rule the de jure as well as de facto situation. The attempt to make Frederick V King of Bohemia is regarded as a catalyst for the [[Thirty Years War]].\n\n====Venice====\nThe [[Republic of Venice]] was ruled from 697 to 1797 by a [[Doge of Venice|doge]], who normally ruled for life, though a few were forced from office. His powers were never those of an absolute monarch, but he was the Republic's [[Chief magistrate|highest official]] and powerful within restrictions and levels of oversight that varied in different periods. The election process began with the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] of more than 2000 Venetian aristocrats and employed an elaborate system designed to prevent one family or alliance from dominating the process. It used smaller nominating groups that were reduced in number by the drawing of lots and required a [[supermajority]] for election.\n\n====Dutch Republic====\n\nIn the [[Dutch Republic]] of the 17th and 18th centuries there was the office of the [[Stadtholder]], whose power fell short of those of a monarch, and which was elective. Each of the seven Dutch provinces could separately elect its own Stadtholder, and it did not have to be the same person in all of them. In theory anyone could be elected Stadtholder, though in practice it was restricted to members of the [[House of Orange]]. There was no obligation to elect a Stadtholder at all, and the leaders of the Dutch Republican faction, such as [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt|Oldenbarnevelt]] and [[Johan de Witt|De Witt]], repeatedly tried to abolish the office of Stadtholder or leave it vacant \u2013 which it was for several decades of Dutch history. Conversely, the House of Orange and its adherents tried to increase the powers of the Stadtholder to approximate those of a monarch, to make it officially hereditary (which it became in the later part of the 18th century) and finally to transform it into a full-fledged monarchy \u2013 as it was in 1815.\n\n====Sovereign Military Order of Malta====\nThe [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], formerly known as the [[Knights Hospitaller]] or the ''Knights of Malta'', remains a [[Sovereignty|sovereign subject]] of [[international law]] since it was exiled to Rome from Malta during the [[French occupation of Malta]] under the [[First French Republic]].<ref>http://www.theutenberg.se/pdf/the_holy_see_the_order_of_malta_and_international_law.pdf</ref> The Order is ruled by the [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Prince and Grand Master]], who is elected for life by the Council Complete of State. The Prince and Grand Master holds the rank of Prince, bestowed by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1607 and holds the precedence of a cardinal of the Church since 1630.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sire |first= H.J.A. |date=1994 | title =The Knights of Malta |publisher= Yale University Press | page= 221 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KhLJcYiV3YAC&pg=PA221 |isbn= 0300068859 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Noonan Jr. | first=James-Charles | date=1996 | title=The Church Visible: The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the Roman Catholic Church | publisher=Viking | page=[https://archive.org/details/churchvisiblecer0000noon/page/135 135] | isbn=0-670-86745-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/churchvisiblecer0000noon/page/135 }}</ref> The Council that elects the prince includes members of the Sovereign Council and other high-ranking office-holders and representatives of the Order's worldwide entities.

The English [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] effectively ended the all-island kingdom's rule.\n\n====Other examples====\nA system of elective monarchy existed in [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] (see [[Witenagemot]]), [[Visigothic kingdom|Visigothic Hispania]], medieval [[Scandinavia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] until 1687 and in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] which ''de iure'' continued to belong to the [[Lands of the Hungarian Crown]].  [[Medieval France]] was an elective monarchy at the time of the first [[House of Capet|Capet]]ian kings; the kings however took the habit of, during their reign, having their son elected as successor. The election soon became a mere formality and vanished after the reign of [[Philip II of France]]. In a much later period of its history, France briefly had again a kind of elective monarchy when [[Napoleon III]] was first elected President of France and then transformed himself into an Emperor \u2013 which, him being the nephew and heir of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]], was not entirely a surprise.\n\nIn late 17th and early 18th century England, the Parliament effectively asserted that Monarchy in England was elective \u2013 at least as between various contenders with some dynastic claim for the throne. During the [[Exclusion Crisis]], King Charles II strongly opposed any such idea \u2013 but following the [[Glorious Revolution]], Parliament did enact the [[Succession to the Crown Act 1707|Act of Succession]], whose effect was to disinherit in the Stuarts and replace them by the Hanoverians whose dynastic claim was far more remote. In later times, with Constitutional Monarchy well established, Parliament made no further interference in the succession to the British throne.\n\nDuring the 19th century, more precisely between 1870 and 1873, an attempt of such a system took place in Spain. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] and [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]'s subsequent deposition in 1868 a new parliament was constituted through direct male suffrage. It was then decided that a democratically elected monarch was needed in Spain. The debates regarding Isabella I's succession took place until October 1869, when [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] was finally chosen. Nevertheless, his reign lasted until 11 October 1873, when he abdicated citing his inability to solve the problems Spain was going through, after which the parliament proclaimed a [[First Spanish Republic|republic]].\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the first monarchs of several newly independent nations were elected by parliaments: [[Norway]] is the prime example. Previously, following precedent set in newly independent [[Greece]], new nations without a well-established hereditary [[royal family]] often chose their own monarchs from among the established [[:Category:European royal families|royal families of Europe]], rather than elevate a member of the local power establishment, in the hope that a stable [[hereditary monarchy]] would eventually emerge from the process. The first king of [[Belgium]], as well as the now-deposed royal families of Greece, [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]] (unsuccessfully) and [[Romania]], were originally appointed in this manner. On 9 October 1918  the Parliament of newly-independent [[Finland]] elected [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]], brother-in-law of the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]], as [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|King of Finland]] \u2013 but soon afterwards, this move was foiled by the German defeat in [[WWI]] and the demise of Monarchy in Germany itself, and Finland opted to become a Republic instead.\n\n===Africa===\nIn Africa, the [[Mali Empire]] functioned as both a constitutional and elective monarchy. The [[Mansa (title)|mansa]], or emperor, had to be approved by the Great Assembly known as the [[Gbara]], despite hereditary claims. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was a purer example of an elective monarchy, where blood claims had even less influence.  Nobles elected a king's successor, and it was common for the successor to be of a different family as his predecessor. This form of elective monarchy existed in the kingdom from its inception in around 1400 until its complete disintegration in the early 20th century.\nIn the pre-colonial period, a number of [[West Africa]]n rulers, such as the kings and chieftains of the [[Ashanti Empire]] and those of [[Ife]] and the [[Oyo Empire]], were elected from amongst the various [[royal family|royal families]] of their polities by colleges of noblemen known as [[kingmaker]]s. This practice has continued to the present day.\n\n===Asia and Oceania===\nThe [[Parthian Empire]] (248BCE-224CE), also known as the Arsacid Empire is considered to be the oldest elective monarchy in the Asia. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Rawlinson |first1=George |title=A Short History of Parthia |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=srJ4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT51&lpg=PT51&dq=Parthian+elective+monarchy&source=bl&ots=TClZ6ybHlG&sig=ACfU3U3e9TYU4CayLHt-0R2YM09LCl9DKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT2rPqrbzoAhWvgVwKHcrJDgUQ6AEwCXoECC0QAQ#v=onepage&q=Parthian%20elective%20monarchy&f=false}}</ref> The [[King of Kings]] have been required to undergo an assembly of the nobles called [[Parliament|Mahest\u0101n]], as vote of approval before being allowed to ascend to the imperial throne or to be removed from the power.\n\nThe ancient Korean kingdom of [[Silla]] elected its first king by a conference of tribal and village elders in 57 BC; later, the monarchy of Silla became hereditary in nature.\n\n[[Gopala]], the first emperor of the [[Pala Empire]] was chosen by independent regional warchiefs in the 8th century.\n\nIn the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Great Khan]] was chosen by the [[Kurultai]].\n\n\nOther monarchs, such as the former [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], have been required to undergo a parliamentary vote of approval before being allowed to ascend to the throne.\n\nIn 1858, the central tribes of [[North Island]] elected Potatau te Wherowhero as their monarch. The [[Tainui]] tribal elders have continued this tradition and the [[New Zealand]] [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] Kingitanga movement alive to the present.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] could be considered a de facto example. From 1864 until the monarchy was overthrown, it was constitutionally a [[hereditary monarchy]] utilizing [[male-preference primogeniture]]. However, the Constitutions of [[1864 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1864]] and [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1887]], and the draft constitution of 1893, all provided that, in the event of the extinction of the royal line, the Legislature would elect a \"native [[ali\u02bbi]]\" as the new monarch and stirps of a new dynasty. In actuality, however, during the entire time from 1864 until the overthrow of the monarchy, the throne was never passed from parent to child, as every Hawaiian monarch who reigned during that period died without leaving issue. Following the 1872 death of [[Kamehameha V|King Kamehameha V]], a non-binding referendum was held, which [[Lunalilo|William Charles Lunalilo]] won; he was subsequently elected king by the legislature in 1873. [[Kal\u0101kaua|King Kal\u0101kaua]] was elected by the legislature in 1874, after Lunalilo's death. However, when Kal\u0101kaua died in 1891, the crown demised to the collateral line of his sister, [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]]. Prior to 1864, the Hawaiian King-in-Council appointed the heir to the Hawaiian throne.\n\nIn 1971 seven individual Emirates in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] united to form the [[United Arab Emirates]] and became a federation. Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], ruler of Abu Dhabi, was elected as the head of the state and Ra'is (President) of the union by the rest of six rulers of the individual Emirates.<ref>\nhttps://www.cpc.gov.ae/en-us/TheUae/Pages/LateSheikhZayed.aspx</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\n\n====Mexico====\nThe [[Tlatoani]]meh of the [[Aztec Empire]] were chosen by a council of elders, nobles, and priests. He would be selected from a pool of four candidates.\n\n====Costa Rica====\nThe ''m\u00e1nkeme'' (king) of the [[Kingdom of Nicoya]] was elected by a council of elders known as the ''mon\u00e9xico''.\n\n====United States====\nAn attempt to create an elective monarchy in the [[United States]] failed. [[Alexander Hamilton]] argued in a long speech before the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] that the [[President of the United States]] should be an elective monarch, ruling for \"good behavior\" (i.e., [[President for life|for life]], unless [[impeachment|impeached]]) and with extensive powers. Hamilton believed that elective monarchs had sufficient power domestically to resist foreign corruption, yet there was enough domestic control over their behavior to prevent tyranny at home.<ref name=\"The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, Volume 9\"/> His proposal was resoundingly voted down in favor of a four-year term with the possibility of reelection. In his later defense of [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]] in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', he often hints that a lifetime executive might be better, even as he praises the system with the four-year term.\n\n====Haiti====\nThe [[Empire of Haiti (1804\u20131806)|Empire of Haiti]], established in 1804, was also elective.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== Election ==\nA hereditary monarchy may occasionally use election to fill a vacant throne. For example, the royal family may become extinct; depending on how precisely the succession to the throne is defined in law, several candidates with equally, or almost equally, strong claims could emerge, with an election being held to choose from among them. This differs from a formally elective monarchy in that it is an extraordinary measure, and with the new monarch the succession again becomes hereditary.\n\nAlternatively, the monarch may be deposed, as in a [[revolution]]. While sometimes a monarch may be forced to abdicate in favour of his or her heir, on other occasions the royal family as a whole has been rejected, the throne going to an elected candidate. Examples of extraordinary election include:\n* [[John of England]], chosen as King of England by a council of nobles and royal advisors at the death of his brother, [[Richard I]], in 1199 because the heir by strict primogeniture, [[Arthur of Brittany]], was a child at that time.\n* In Scotland, the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320 asserted the rights of the nobles to choose a King if required.\n* [[Henry IV of England]], chosen by Parliament in 1399 to replace [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. Richard was childless, and the [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Earl of March]], the next in line to the throne, was a young child at the time, so Parliament bypassed him in favour of Henry, who had led a revolt against Richard.\n* [[Michael of Russia]], chosen by a [[Zemsky Sobor]] (national assembly) in 1613 after the extinction of the [[Rurikid dynasty]] and the end of the [[Time of Troubles]]. The resulting [[Romanov dynasty]] was an old [[boyar]] house with close ties to the former royal family, and Michael's father, [[Patriarch Philaret of Moscow|Feodor Romanov]], was at the time a [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]] under the monastic name of Filaret, in effect holding a position of [[interrex]]. Later, Patriarch Filaret, a skilled politician in his own right, became effectively a co-ruler and sometimes a regent for his weak and not very healthy son.\n* [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England]], chosen by Parliament to replace [[James II of England|James II]]. (Mary was James' daughter, William was James' nephew, and William and Mary were succeeded by Mary's younger sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].) Parliament passed [[Act of Settlement 1701|laws]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries which explicitly excluded Catholics (and thus the male descendants of James II) in the [[succession to the British throne|order of succession]].\n* In Portugal, on 6 April 1385 in the aftermath of [[1383\u20131385 Crisis]], the [[Portuguese Cortes|Council of the Kingdom]] elected [[John I of Portugal|John I]], then Master of the [[Order of Aviz]], as [[King of Portugal]]. His half-brother [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] had died without a male heir in October 1383, and different factions made strenuous efforts to secure the throne for [[Beatrice of Portugal|Princess Beatrice]], Ferdinand's only daughter and [[Queen consort of Castile]] and [[Queen consort of Leon|Le\u00f3n]], or for either of her uncles [[Infante John, Duke of Valencia de Campos]] and [[Infante Denis, Lord of Cifuentes]]. The Council elected instead the younger (and illegitimate) son of [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter I]], thus avoiding a [[jure uxoris]] Castilian king.\n* [[Louis-Philippe of France]], chosen to become [[King of the French]] by the French Chamber of Deputies during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830.\n* In 1971 upon the formation of the [[United Arab Emirates]], a federation of seven Emirates, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] was elected as the head of the state and Ra'is (President) of the union by the rest of six ruling monarchs of the individual Emirates, while Zayed himself voted for [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], then ruler of Dubai.<ref>\nhttps://www.cpc.gov.ae/en-us/TheUae/Pages/LateSheikhZayed.aspx</ref><ref>https://m.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/when-sheikh-mohammed-met-his-second-father-sheikh-zayed</ref>\n\n== Invitation ==\nBefore republics became widespread or default form of modern government, back when many states operated as monarchies by default, new polities or countries in internal turmoil sometimes selected and invited some person to become their monarch. The selected person might have had little or nothing to do with his prospective kingdom; he might have had associations with a current great power or with a current regional power, or might appear as a true outsider, (hopefully) unbiased in matters of internal politics. (The concept of \"invitation\" may discreetly gloss over intense lobbying or diplomatic manoeuvring in some cases.) By selecting a foreign prince or aristocrat, nations could expect to gain diplomatic links and a figurehead accustomed to the trappings of courts and ceremonial duties. Newly established states in the 19th and early 20th centuries established trends in the selection and appointment of newly minted monarchs.\n\nExamples include:\n\n* 862: according to tradition, various tribes of northern [[Ruthenia|Rus']] invited [[Rurik]], a chief of their former Varangian foes, to re-establish order: his descendants ruled in Kiev, Muscovy and Russia until 1612. The legend of an invitation echoes the habit of later invitations to [[Rurikids]] and others to rule in Pskov<ref>\n{{cite book\n| editor1-last = Blockmans\n| editor1-first = Wim\n| editor1-link = Wim Blockmans\n| editor2-last = Krom\n| editor2-first = Mikhail\n| editor3-last = Wubs-Mrozewicz\n| editor3-first = Justyna\n| title = The Routledge Handbook of Maritime Trade around Europe 1300\u20131600: Commercial Networks and Urban Autonomy\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RUUlDgAAQBAJ\n| series = Routledge History Handbooks\n| publisher = Taylor & Francis\n| date = 2017\n| isbn = 9781315278551\n| access-date = 2017-07-18\n| quote = The Pskov men invited princes to Pskov whose professional armoured cavalry was very important for a city that had constant wars with the Livonian Order.

Nine hereditary rulers from the [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay States]] form a [[Council of Rulers]] who will determine the next ''Agong'' via a secret ballot. The position has to date been ''[[de facto]]'' rotated amongst the State rulers, originally based on seniority.\n** Additionally, the Malaysian [[States of Malaysia|state]] of [[Negeri Sembilan]] is ''itself'' an elective monarchy, where the ''[[Yamtuan Besar|Yang di-Pertuan Besar]]'' of Negeri Sembilan is selected by a council of ruling chiefs. The ruling chiefs themselves are elected by the chieftain. Male candidates are determined based on [[matrilineal]] clan. The system was partially the basis for the federal monarchy.\n** The [[Sultan of Perak]] is selected from amongst the most senior male princes descending from the 18th Sultan of Perak, Sultan Ahmadin. The Sultan, ''Raja Muda'' (Crown Prince), and ''Raja Di-Hilir'' (Deputy Crown Prince) are selected by the Dewan Negara of Perak. A son of the reigning Sultan cannot become ''Raja Muda'' if there is a more senior prince descended from the previous Sultan; this is possible should the senior prince relinquish his right to become ''Raja Muda''.\n*'''[[Samoa]]''' was established as an elective monarchy upon its independence in 1962. The [[Constitution of Samoa]] stipulates successors to the two original heads of state, [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] and [[Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole]], who were one of the four paramount chiefs (''Tama-a-Aiga''), are to be elected for five-year terms by the ''[[Fono]]'', the Samoan parliament. Articles 18 and 45 of the Constitution provide, respectively, that any Member of Parliament may be elected head of state, and that any Samoan citizen may be elected to Parliament, although 47 out of the 49 seats in the ''Fono'' are reserved for ''[[Fa'amatai|matai]]'', or chiefs (the other two are reserved for non-Samoans).<ref name=\"paclii\"/> Thus Samoa might possibly be considered a [[parliamentary republic]]; however, the head of state is still referred to as \"[[His Highness]]\",<ref name=\"head-of-state-samoa\"/> nor does the Constitution expressly declare that the form of government has been changed. The incumbent as of 2018, [[Va'aletoa Sualauvi II]], is also one of the four paramount chiefs.\n*'''[[United Arab Emirates]]''' has a [[President of the United Arab Emirates|president]] called ''Ra'is''. This is an elected position elected by the [[Federal Supreme Council]] with a term of 5 years.<ref>https://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302800701</ref> Since its formation, the position has been a ''de facto'' hereditary position to the Al Nahyan sheikhs of [[Abu Dhabi]] by consensus of the Federal Supreme Council. Likewise, the Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE is a position held by the Al Maktoum sheikhs of [[Dubai]]. Elections are held every 5 years. The position of the ruler of each emirate of the United Arab Emirates is determined by consensus of the respective ruling royal family of that emirate.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=UAE: How to Invest, Start and Run Profitable Business in the UAE |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=JldwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=uae+elective+monarchy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih6e-dxZ7mAhUUA2MBHQvZAZQQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=uae%20elective%20monarchy&f=false |location=Washington DC |publisher=International Business Publications |page=41 |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Countries and Territories of the World |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=TsoJhzc426cC&pg=PA456&dq=uae+elective+monarchy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtkJaUwp7mAhVh6uAKHa0ICCkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=uae%20elective%20monarchy&f=false |page=456}}</ref>\n===Similar forms===\n* [[Andorra]] could be considered a semi-elective [[principality]]. Andorra's two heads of state are [[Spain]]'s [[Bishop of La Seu d'Urgell]] and, since 1589, the king of [[France]]. As the [[French monarchy]] has long since been eliminated, the position of co-prince of Andorra falls to the democratically elected [[President of France]]. However, the Andorran authorities or people have no say in the election of the President of France, leaving Andorra in the unique position of having a monarch who is democratically elected by the citizenry of another state.\n* [[Eswatini|Swaziland/Eswatini]] has a form of quasi-elective monarchy. In the country, no king can appoint his successor. Instead, the royal family decides which of his wives shall be \" [[Great Wife]]\" and \"[[Indlovukazi]]\" (She-Elephant / Queen Mother). The son of this \"Great Wife\" will automatically become the next king. The eldest son is never appointed successor as he has other ceremonial roles.\n* [[Nigeria]] has a system whereby [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] (or \"royal fathers\", e.g., the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]s, [[Eze]]s and [[Emir]]s) are usually elected by councils of [[kingmaker]]s from almost endless pools of contending cousins who are eligible for the elections because they all claim descent from founding monarchs or other royals. Each title is therefore held for life by one of these dynastic cousins in turn, often through rotation.\n* The [[cacique]] of the [[Ng\u00f6be people]] of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] is appointed for life by a council of 13 elders.

Since 2007, the process of establishing the consensus of the House has been institutionalized in the form of the [[Allegiance Council]], comprising the most powerful senior princes, which has the power to disapprove the King's nominee for Crown Prince and substitute its own by simple majority vote.<ref name=\"allegiance\">{{cite web|title=The Allegiance Institution Law|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/archive/2006/transcript/Page4.aspx|publisher=Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Washington, DC|date=20 October 2006|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> In effect, this makes the Saudi monarchy elective within the House of Saud, as the king's eldest son has not become Crown Prince since the death of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in 1953.\n* The [[Maori King Movement]] in [[New Zealand]] chooses a Maori monarch, elected by the [[kaumatua]] of various New Zealand [[iwi]] (tribes).

The manner of election, the nature of candidate qualifications, and the electors vary from case to case. Historically it is not uncommon for elective monarchies to transform into hereditary ones over time, or for hereditary ones to acquire at least occasional elective aspects.\n\n==Evolution==\nMany, if not most, kingdoms were officially elective historically, though the candidates were typically only from the family of the deceased monarch. Eventually, however, most elected monarchies introduced [[hereditary succession]], guaranteeing that the title and office stayed within the royal family and specifying, more or less precisely, the order of succession.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nToday, almost all monarchies are hereditary monarchies in which the monarchs come from one [[royal family]] with the office of [[monarch|sovereign]] being passed from one family member to another upon the death or [[abdication]] of the incumbent.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Historical examples==\n===Europe===\n====Ancient Greece====\nThe kings of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] and of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] of the ''[[Athenian democracy#Etymology|Demos]]'', the assembly of all free [[classical Athens|Athenian]] citizens. Military service often was linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house.\n\n====Rome / Byzantium ====\nIn the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]], the kings were elected by the [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]]. Once the Roman kings were overthrown, there remained an absolute prohibition for royal establishment in the Roman constitution, a prohibition which formally remained in place during imperial times, both classical [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]. In practice, however, Imperial Rome was a monarchy.  During the [[Principate]] (27BCE to 284CE), which was the foundational stage of Roman emperorship, Roman monarchs would often take care to disguise their de facto position with the de jure apparatus of republicanism.  This was particularly the case for [[Augustus]], the first Emperor, who established the Principate.  Whilst given many titles (including \"Augustus\", i.e. \"majestic\") he described himself as \"princeps senatus\", or merely \"first among senators\".  The illusion of being elected from the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] continued when Tiberius succeeded to the purple.  Whilst over time the principle weakened as [[Roman Republic|republican government]] passed into distant history to the effect that the Empire became, functionally, an absolute monarchy the office of Roman and Byzantine emperor remained vaguely elective (albeit with the election procedure never strictly defined, but generally understood to be a matter for the Senate).  For instance, whilst the first five Emperors were all [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|descended from Julius Caesar]], in each case their position was proclaimed, not inherited as of right.  [[Claudius]], the fourth Emperor, in particular stands out, being \"elected\" to office once the [[Praetorian Guard]] had made it clear he was their candidate.\n\nAccordingly, heredity never was, and could never be, formally established in law. And whilst the later, more overtly authoritarian [[Dominate]] period further stripped the republican veneer from the constitution, Emperors succeeded by a mixture of proclamation by the Legions or Senate as much as by blood (though sons did succeed fathers).\n\nIn order to bypass the prohibition on heredity and ensure dynastic continuity, many reigning Byzantine emperors had their heirs crowned co-emperor so that the throne could not be considered vacant at their own death and thus the need for succession by election would not arise.\n\n====Holy Roman Empire====\n{{Further|Imperial election}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] is perhaps the best-known example of an elective monarchy. However, from 1440 to 1740, a Habsburg was always elected [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]], the throne becoming unofficially hereditary.<ref name=\"The Emperor: Qualifications\"/> During that period, the emperor was elected from within the [[House of Habsburg]] by a small council of nobles called [[prince-elector]]s. The secular electoral seats were hereditary.  However, spiritual electors (and other prince-(arch)bishops) were usually elected by the [[cathedral chapter]]s as religious leaders, but simultaneously ruled as monarch (prince) of a territory of [[imperial immediacy]] (which usually comprised a part of their diocesan territory). Thus the [[prince-bishopric]]s were elective monarchies too. The same holds true for prince-abbacies, whose princess-abbesses or [[prince-abbot]]s were elected by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of clerics and imperially appointed as princely rulers in a pertaining territory.\n\n====Kingdom of Jerusalem====\nIn the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the kingship was partially elected and partially hereditary. During the height of the kingdom in the mid-12th century there was a royal family and a relatively clear line of succession. Nevertheless, the king was elected, or at least recognized, by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]. Here the king was considered a ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (first among equals), and in his absence his duties were performed by his [[officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|seneschal]].\n\n====Scandinavia====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nOriginally, the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Kings of Sweden]] were elected by all free men at the [[Stones of Mora|Mora]] [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]. Elective monarchy continued until 1544, when the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] designated the [[House of Vasa|heirs]] of King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] as the heirs to the throne. The [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish monarchy]] was also officially elective, although the eldest son of the reigning monarch was usually elected. This continued until 1660, when a hereditary and [[absolute monarchy]] was instituted by [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]]. Though the [[monarchy of Norway]] was originally hereditary, it too became elective in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Candidates had to be of royal blood, but the kingship was elected by a council of noblemen, rather than automatically passing to the eldest son. In 1905 [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Carl]] was elected King of Norway, after the male population in an election decided Norway should still be a monarchy.\n\nThe Scandinavian kingdoms were united under the Danish crown by [[Margaret I of Denmark]] in 1389, but many of her successors had the united kingdoms split up as Sweden elected a different king than Denmark and Norway upon succession. The election was usually contested through a Danish invasion of Sweden until [[Christian II of Denmark]] after his reconquest of Sweden had all those voting against him executed in the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] (1520), which ended all support for the Danish king on the Swedish throne.\n\nIn 1810, the Swedish [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] elected the French Marshall [[Jean Bernadotte]] to be the new [[Crown Prince]], since it was apparent that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]]. Bernadotte eventually ascended the throne as [[Charles XIV John of Sweden]] and founded the still current [[House of Bernadotte]]. In this case the elective aspect in the choice of Monarch was especially prominent, since Bernadotte was a French commoner with no previous connection to Sweden and not the most remote of dynastic claims to the Swedish throne \u2013 his being chosen derived solely from urgent political and military considerations of the crisis time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n====Poland-Lithuania====\n{{main|Royal elections in Poland}}\n[[File:Potega Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu Zlota wolnosc Elekcja 1573.JPG|thumb|300px|right|''The Republic at the Zenith of Its Power. [[Golden Liberty]]. The [[Royal elections in Poland|Royal Election]] of 1573'', by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\nIn [[Poland]], after the death of the last [[Piast]] in 1370, Polish kings were initially elected by a small council; gradually, this privilege was granted to all members of the ''[[szlachta]]'' (Polish nobility). Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania during the times of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569\u20131795) were elected by gatherings of crowds of nobles at a field in [[Wola]], today a neighbourhood of [[Warsaw]]. Since in Poland all sons of a noble were nobles, and not only the eldest, every one of an estimated 500,000 nobles could potentially have participated in such elections in person \u2013 by far the widest franchise of any European country at the time. During the election period, the function of the king was performed by an [[Interrex (Poland)|interrex]] (usually in the person of the [[primate of Poland]]). This unique Polish election was termed the [[Free election (Polish throne)|free election]] (''wolna elekcja'').\n\n====Bohemia====\n\nSince medieval times, the [[King of Bohemia]] was elected by the [[Estate (land)|Estate]]s of [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. Since 1526, when the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] assumed the Bohemian Crown, it was always held by the [[Habsburg]]s, who expected this situation to go on indefinitely. In 1618 the Bohemians chose to exercise in practice their legal right to choose a King at their discretion, and bestowed the Bohemian Crown on [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] \u2013 \"The Winter King\". However, the Habsburgs regarded this as an act of rebellion, imposed their rule over Bohemia in the [[Battle of the White Mountain]] and in the aftermath abolished the Bohemian Elective Monarchy and made exclusive Habsburg rule the de jure as well as de facto situation. The attempt to make Frederick V King of Bohemia is regarded as a catalyst for the [[Thirty Years War]].\n\n====Venice====\nThe [[Republic of Venice]] was ruled from 697 to 1797 by a [[Doge of Venice|doge]], who normally ruled for life, though a few were forced from office. His powers were never those of an absolute monarch, but he was the Republic's [[Chief magistrate|highest official]] and powerful within restrictions and levels of oversight that varied in different periods. The election process began with the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] of more than 2000 Venetian aristocrats and employed an elaborate system designed to prevent one family or alliance from dominating the process. It used smaller nominating groups that were reduced in number by the drawing of lots and required a [[supermajority]] for election.\n\n====Dutch Republic====\n\nIn the [[Dutch Republic]] of the 17th and 18th centuries there was the office of the [[Stadtholder]], whose power fell short of those of a monarch, and which was elective. Each of the seven Dutch provinces could separately elect its own Stadtholder, and it did not have to be the same person in all of them. In theory anyone could be elected Stadtholder, though in practice it was restricted to members of the [[House of Orange]]. There was no obligation to elect a Stadtholder at all, and the leaders of the Dutch Republican faction, such as [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt|Oldenbarnevelt]] and [[Johan de Witt|De Witt]], repeatedly tried to abolish the office of Stadtholder or leave it vacant \u2013 which it was for several decades of Dutch history. Conversely, the House of Orange and its adherents tried to increase the powers of the Stadtholder to approximate those of a monarch, to make it officially hereditary (which it became in the later part of the 18th century) and finally to transform it into a full-fledged monarchy \u2013 as it was in 1815.\n\n====Sovereign Military Order of Malta====\nThe [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], formerly known as the [[Knights Hospitaller]] or the ''Knights of Malta'', remains a [[Sovereignty|sovereign subject]] of [[international law]] since it was exiled to Rome from Malta during the [[French occupation of Malta]] under the [[First French Republic]].<ref>http://www.theutenberg.se/pdf/the_holy_see_the_order_of_malta_and_international_law.pdf</ref> The Order is ruled by the [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Prince and Grand Master]], who is elected for life by the Council Complete of State. The Prince and Grand Master holds the rank of Prince, bestowed by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1607 and holds the precedence of a cardinal of the Church since 1630.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sire |first= H.J.A. |date=1994 | title =The Knights of Malta |publisher= Yale University Press | page= 221 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KhLJcYiV3YAC&pg=PA221 |isbn= 0300068859 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Noonan Jr. | first=James-Charles | date=1996 | title=The Church Visible: The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the Roman Catholic Church | publisher=Viking | page=[https://archive.org/details/churchvisiblecer0000noon/page/135 135] | isbn=0-670-86745-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/churchvisiblecer0000noon/page/135 }}</ref> The Council that elects the prince includes members of the Sovereign Council and other high-ranking office-holders and representatives of the Order's worldwide entities.

The English [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] effectively ended the all-island kingdom's rule.\n\n====Other examples====\nA system of elective monarchy existed in [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] (see [[Witenagemot]]), [[Visigothic kingdom|Visigothic Hispania]], medieval [[Scandinavia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] until 1687 and in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] which ''de iure'' continued to belong to the [[Lands of the Hungarian Crown]].  [[Medieval France]] was an elective monarchy at the time of the first [[House of Capet|Capet]]ian kings; the kings however took the habit of, during their reign, having their son elected as successor. The election soon became a mere formality and vanished after the reign of [[Philip II of France]]. In a much later period of its history, France briefly had again a kind of elective monarchy when [[Napoleon III]] was first elected President of France and then transformed himself into an Emperor \u2013 which, him being the nephew and heir of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]], was not entirely a surprise.\n\nIn late 17th and early 18th century England, the Parliament effectively asserted that Monarchy in England was elective \u2013 at least as between various contenders with some dynastic claim for the throne. During the [[Exclusion Crisis]], King Charles II strongly opposed any such idea \u2013 but following the [[Glorious Revolution]], Parliament did enact the [[Succession to the Crown Act 1707|Act of Succession]], whose effect was to disinherit in the Stuarts and replace them by the Hanoverians whose dynastic claim was far more remote. In later times, with Constitutional Monarchy well established, Parliament made no further interference in the succession to the British throne.\n\nDuring the 19th century, more precisely between 1870 and 1873, an attempt of such a system took place in Spain. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] and [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]'s subsequent deposition in 1868 a new parliament was constituted through direct male suffrage. It was then decided that a democratically elected monarch was needed in Spain. The debates regarding Isabella I's succession took place until October 1869, when [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] was finally chosen. Nevertheless, his reign lasted until 11 October 1873, when he abdicated citing his inability to solve the problems Spain was going through, after which the parliament proclaimed a [[First Spanish Republic|republic]].\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the first monarchs of several newly independent nations were elected by parliaments: [[Norway]] is the prime example. Previously, following precedent set in newly independent [[Greece]], new nations without a well-established hereditary [[royal family]] often chose their own monarchs from among the established [[:Category:European royal families|royal families of Europe]], rather than elevate a member of the local power establishment, in the hope that a stable [[hereditary monarchy]] would eventually emerge from the process. The first king of [[Belgium]], as well as the now-deposed royal families of Greece, [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]] (unsuccessfully) and [[Romania]], were originally appointed in this manner. On 9 October 1918  the Parliament of newly-independent [[Finland]] elected [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]], brother-in-law of the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]], as [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|King of Finland]] \u2013 but soon afterwards, this move was foiled by the German defeat in [[WWI]] and the demise of Monarchy in Germany itself, and Finland opted to become a Republic instead.\n\n===Africa===\nIn Africa, the [[Mali Empire]] functioned as both a constitutional and elective monarchy. The [[Mansa (title)|mansa]], or emperor, had to be approved by the Great Assembly known as the [[Gbara]], despite hereditary claims. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was a purer example of an elective monarchy, where blood claims had even less influence.  Nobles elected a king's successor, and it was common for the successor to be of a different family as his predecessor. This form of elective monarchy existed in the kingdom from its inception in around 1400 until its complete disintegration in the early 20th century.\nIn the pre-colonial period, a number of [[West Africa]]n rulers, such as the kings and chieftains of the [[Ashanti Empire]] and those of [[Ife]] and the [[Oyo Empire]], were elected from amongst the various [[royal family|royal families]] of their polities by colleges of noblemen known as [[kingmaker]]s. This practice has continued to the present day.\n\n===Asia and Oceania===\nThe [[Parthian Empire]] (248BCE-224CE), also known as the Arsacid Empire is considered to be the oldest elective monarchy in the Asia. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Rawlinson |first1=George |title=A Short History of Parthia |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=srJ4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT51&lpg=PT51&dq=Parthian+elective+monarchy&source=bl&ots=TClZ6ybHlG&sig=ACfU3U3e9TYU4CayLHt-0R2YM09LCl9DKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT2rPqrbzoAhWvgVwKHcrJDgUQ6AEwCXoECC0QAQ#v=onepage&q=Parthian%20elective%20monarchy&f=false}}</ref> The [[King of Kings]] have been required to undergo an assembly of the nobles called [[Parliament|Mahest\u0101n]], as vote of approval before being allowed to ascend to the imperial throne or to be removed from the power.\n\nThe ancient Korean kingdom of [[Silla]] elected its first king by a conference of tribal and village elders in 57 BC; later, the monarchy of Silla became hereditary in nature.\n\n[[Gopala]], the first emperor of the [[Pala Empire]] was chosen by independent regional warchiefs in the 8th century.\n\nIn the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Great Khan]] was chosen by the [[Kurultai]].\n\n\nOther monarchs, such as the former [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], have been required to undergo a parliamentary vote of approval before being allowed to ascend to the throne.\n\nIn 1858, the central tribes of [[North Island]] elected Potatau te Wherowhero as their monarch. The [[Tainui]] tribal elders have continued this tradition and the [[New Zealand]] [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] Kingitanga movement alive to the present.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] could be considered a de facto example. From 1864 until the monarchy was overthrown, it was constitutionally a [[hereditary monarchy]] utilizing [[male-preference primogeniture]]. However, the Constitutions of [[1864 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1864]] and [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1887]], and the draft constitution of 1893, all provided that, in the event of the extinction of the royal line, the Legislature would elect a \"native [[ali\u02bbi]]\" as the new monarch and stirps of a new dynasty. In actuality, however, during the entire time from 1864 until the overthrow of the monarchy, the throne was never passed from parent to child, as every Hawaiian monarch who reigned during that period died without leaving issue. Following the 1872 death of [[Kamehameha V|King Kamehameha V]], a non-binding referendum was held, which [[Lunalilo|William Charles Lunalilo]] won; he was subsequently elected king by the legislature in 1873. [[Kal\u0101kaua|King Kal\u0101kaua]] was elected by the legislature in 1874, after Lunalilo's death. However, when Kal\u0101kaua died in 1891, the crown demised to the collateral line of his sister, [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]]. Prior to 1864, the Hawaiian King-in-Council appointed the heir to the Hawaiian throne.\n\nIn 1971 seven individual Emirates in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] united to form the [[United Arab Emirates]] and became a federation. Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], ruler of Abu Dhabi, was elected as the head of the state and Ra'is (President) of the union by the rest of six rulers of the individual Emirates.<ref>\nhttps://www.cpc.gov.ae/en-us/TheUae/Pages/LateSheikhZayed.aspx</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\n\n====Mexico====\nThe [[Tlatoani]]meh of the [[Aztec Empire]] were chosen by a council of elders, nobles, and priests. He would be selected from a pool of four candidates.\n\n====Costa Rica====\nThe ''m\u00e1nkeme'' (king) of the [[Kingdom of Nicoya]] was elected by a council of elders known as the ''mon\u00e9xico''.\n\n====United States====\nAn attempt to create an elective monarchy in the [[United States]] failed. [[Alexander Hamilton]] argued in a long speech before the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] that the [[President of the United States]] should be an elective monarch, ruling for \"good behavior\" (i.e., [[President for life|for life]], unless [[impeachment|impeached]]) and with extensive powers. Hamilton believed that elective monarchs had sufficient power domestically to resist foreign corruption, yet there was enough domestic control over their behavior to prevent tyranny at home.<ref name=\"The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, Volume 9\"/> His proposal was resoundingly voted down in favor of a four-year term with the possibility of reelection. In his later defense of [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]] in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', he often hints that a lifetime executive might be better, even as he praises the system with the four-year term.\n\n====Haiti====\nThe [[Empire of Haiti (1804\u20131806)|Empire of Haiti]], established in 1804, was also elective.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== Election ==\nA hereditary monarchy may occasionally use election to fill a vacant throne. For example, the royal family may become extinct; depending on how precisely the succession to the throne is defined in law, several candidates with equally, or almost equally, strong claims could emerge, with an election being held to choose from among them. This differs from a formally elective monarchy in that it is an extraordinary measure, and with the new monarch the succession again becomes hereditary.\n\nAlternatively, the monarch may be deposed, as in a [[revolution]]. While sometimes a monarch may be forced to abdicate in favour of his or her heir, on other occasions the royal family as a whole has been rejected, the throne going to an elected candidate. Examples of extraordinary election include:\n* [[John of England]], chosen as King of England by a council of nobles and royal advisors at the death of his brother, [[Richard I]], in 1199 because the heir by strict primogeniture, [[Arthur of Brittany]], was a child at that time.\n* In Scotland, the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320 asserted the rights of the nobles to choose a King if required.\n* [[Henry IV of England]], chosen by Parliament in 1399 to replace [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. Richard was childless, and the [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Earl of March]], the next in line to the throne, was a young child at the time, so Parliament bypassed him in favour of Henry, who had led a revolt against Richard.\n* [[Michael of Russia]], chosen by a [[Zemsky Sobor]] (national assembly) in 1613 after the extinction of the [[Rurikid dynasty]] and the end of the [[Time of Troubles]]. The resulting [[Romanov dynasty]] was an old [[boyar]] house with close ties to the former royal family, and Michael's father, [[Patriarch Philaret of Moscow|Feodor Romanov]], was at the time a [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]] under the monastic name of Filaret, in effect holding a position of [[interrex]]. Later, Patriarch Filaret, a skilled politician in his own right, became effectively a co-ruler and sometimes a regent for his weak and not very healthy son.\n* [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England]], chosen by Parliament to replace [[James II of England|James II]]. (Mary was James' daughter, William was James' nephew, and William and Mary were succeeded by Mary's younger sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].) Parliament passed [[Act of Settlement 1701|laws]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries which explicitly excluded Catholics (and thus the male descendants of James II) in the [[succession to the British throne|order of succession]].\n* In Portugal, on 6 April 1385 in the aftermath of [[1383\u20131385 Crisis]], the [[Portuguese Cortes|Council of the Kingdom]] elected [[John I of Portugal|John I]], then Master of the [[Order of Aviz]], as [[King of Portugal]]. His half-brother [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] had died without a male heir in October 1383, and different factions made strenuous efforts to secure the throne for [[Beatrice of Portugal|Princess Beatrice]], Ferdinand's only daughter and [[Queen consort of Castile]] and [[Queen consort of Leon|Le\u00f3n]], or for either of her uncles [[Infante John, Duke of Valencia de Campos]] and [[Infante Denis, Lord of Cifuentes]]. The Council elected instead the younger (and illegitimate) son of [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter I]], thus avoiding a [[jure uxoris]] Castilian king.\n* [[Louis-Philippe of France]], chosen to become [[King of the French]] by the French Chamber of Deputies during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830.\n* In 1971 upon the formation of the [[United Arab Emirates]], a federation of seven Emirates, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] was elected as the head of the state and Ra'is (President) of the union by the rest of six ruling monarchs of the individual Emirates, while Zayed himself voted for [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], then ruler of Dubai.<ref>\nhttps://www.cpc.gov.ae/en-us/TheUae/Pages/LateSheikhZayed.aspx</ref><ref>https://m.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/when-sheikh-mohammed-met-his-second-father-sheikh-zayed</ref>\n\n== Invitation ==\nBefore republics became widespread or default form of modern government, back when many states operated as monarchies by default, new polities or countries in internal turmoil sometimes selected and invited some person to become their monarch. The selected person might have had little or nothing to do with his prospective kingdom; he might have had associations with a current great power or with a current regional power, or might appear as a true outsider, (hopefully) unbiased in matters of internal politics. (The concept of \"invitation\" may discreetly gloss over intense lobbying or diplomatic manoeuvring in some cases.) By selecting a foreign prince or aristocrat, nations could expect to gain diplomatic links and a figurehead accustomed to the trappings of courts and ceremonial duties. Newly established states in the 19th and early 20th centuries established trends in the selection and appointment of newly minted monarchs.\n\nExamples include:\n\n* 862: according to tradition, various tribes of northern [[Ruthenia|Rus']] invited [[Rurik]], a chief of their former Varangian foes, to re-establish order: his descendants ruled in Kiev, Muscovy and Russia until 1612. The legend of an invitation echoes the habit of later invitations to [[Rurikids]] and others to rule in Pskov<ref>\n{{cite book\n| editor1-last = Blockmans\n| editor1-first = Wim\n| editor1-link = Wim Blockmans\n| editor2-last = Krom\n| editor2-first = Mikhail\n| editor3-last = Wubs-Mrozewicz\n| editor3-first = Justyna\n| title = The Routledge Handbook of Maritime Trade around Europe 1300\u20131600: Commercial Networks and Urban Autonomy\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RUUlDgAAQBAJ\n| series = Routledge History Handbooks\n| publisher = Taylor & Francis\n| date = 2017\n| isbn = 9781315278551\n| access-date = 2017-07-18\n| quote = The Pskov men invited princes to Pskov whose professional armoured cavalry was very important for a city that had constant wars with the Livonian Order.

Nine hereditary rulers from the [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay States]] form a [[Council of Rulers]] who will determine the next ''Agong'' via a secret ballot. The position has to date been ''[[de facto]]'' rotated amongst the State rulers, originally based on seniority.\n** Additionally, the Malaysian [[States of Malaysia|state]] of [[Negeri Sembilan]] is ''itself'' an elective monarchy, where the ''[[Yamtuan Besar|Yang di-Pertuan Besar]]'' of Negeri Sembilan is selected by a council of ruling chiefs. The ruling chiefs themselves are elected by the chieftain. Male candidates are determined based on [[matrilineal]] clan. The system was partially the basis for the federal monarchy.\n** The [[Sultan of Perak]] is selected from amongst the most senior male princes descending from the 18th Sultan of Perak, Sultan Ahmadin. The Sultan, ''Raja Muda'' (Crown Prince), and ''Raja Di-Hilir'' (Deputy Crown Prince) are selected by the Dewan Negara of Perak. A son of the reigning Sultan cannot become ''Raja Muda'' if there is a more senior prince descended from the previous Sultan; this is possible should the senior prince relinquish his right to become ''Raja Muda''.\n*'''[[Samoa]]''' was established as an elective monarchy upon its independence in 1962. The [[Constitution of Samoa]] stipulates successors to the two original heads of state, [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] and [[Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole]], who were one of the four paramount chiefs (''Tama-a-Aiga''), are to be elected for five-year terms by the ''[[Fono]]'', the Samoan parliament. Articles 18 and 45 of the Constitution provide, respectively, that any Member of Parliament may be elected head of state, and that any Samoan citizen may be elected to Parliament, although 47 out of the 49 seats in the ''Fono'' are reserved for ''[[Fa'amatai|matai]]'', or chiefs (the other two are reserved for non-Samoans).<ref name=\"paclii\"/> Thus Samoa might possibly be considered a [[parliamentary republic]]; however, the head of state is still referred to as \"[[His Highness]]\",<ref name=\"head-of-state-samoa\"/> nor does the Constitution expressly declare that the form of government has been changed. The incumbent as of 2018, [[Va'aletoa Sualauvi II]], is also one of the four paramount chiefs.\n*'''[[United Arab Emirates]]''' has a [[President of the United Arab Emirates|president]] called ''Ra'is''. This is an elected position elected by the [[Federal Supreme Council]] with a term of 5 years.<ref>https://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302800701</ref> Since its formation, the position has been a ''de facto'' hereditary position to the Al Nahyan sheikhs of [[Abu Dhabi]] by consensus of the Federal Supreme Council. Likewise, the Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE is a position held by the Al Maktoum sheikhs of [[Dubai]]. Elections are held every 5 years. The position of the ruler of each emirate of the United Arab Emirates is determined by consensus of the respective ruling royal family of that emirate.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=UAE: How to Invest, Start and Run Profitable Business in the UAE |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=JldwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=uae+elective+monarchy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih6e-dxZ7mAhUUA2MBHQvZAZQQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=uae%20elective%20monarchy&f=false |location=Washington DC |publisher=International Business Publications |page=41 |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Countries and Territories of the World |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=TsoJhzc426cC&pg=PA456&dq=uae+elective+monarchy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtkJaUwp7mAhVh6uAKHa0ICCkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=uae%20elective%20monarchy&f=false |page=456}}</ref>\n===Similar forms===\n* [[Andorra]] could be considered a semi-elective [[principality]]. Andorra's two heads of state are [[Spain]]'s [[Bishop of La Seu d'Urgell]] and, since 1589, the king of [[France]]. As the [[French monarchy]] has long since been eliminated, the position of co-prince of Andorra falls to the democratically elected [[President of France]]. However, the Andorran authorities or people have no say in the election of the President of France, leaving Andorra in the unique position of having a monarch who is democratically elected by the citizenry of another state.\n* [[Eswatini|Swaziland/Eswatini]] has a form of quasi-elective monarchy. In the country, no king can appoint his successor. Instead, the royal family decides which of his wives shall be \" [[Great Wife]]\" and \"[[Indlovukazi]]\" (She-Elephant / Queen Mother). The son of this \"Great Wife\" will automatically become the next king. The eldest son is never appointed successor as he has other ceremonial roles.\n* [[Nigeria]] has a system whereby [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] (or \"royal fathers\", e.g., the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]s, [[Eze]]s and [[Emir]]s) are usually elected by councils of [[kingmaker]]s from almost endless pools of contending cousins who are eligible for the elections because they all claim descent from founding monarchs or other royals. Each title is therefore held for life by one of these dynastic cousins in turn, often through rotation.\n* The [[cacique]] of the [[Ng\u00f6be people]] of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] is appointed for life by a council of 13 elders. The latest election was in 2013 after the death of the previous cacique at around 100 years old.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elecci\u00f3n de un cacique en tiempos modernos|url=http://www.diarioextra.com/Dnew/noticiaDetalle/40815|agency=Diario Extra}}</ref> Current cacique is Costa Rican-born Pedro Palacios, son of the previous cacique Pedro Bejarano.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brus malis se viste de fiesta tras elecci\u00f3n de nuevo l\u00edder ind\u00edgena|url=http://actualidadcr.com/index.php/nacionales/739-brus-malis-se-viste-de-fiesta-tras-eleccion-de-nuevo-lider-indigena|agency=Actualidad CR}}</ref>\n* [[Saudi Arabia]]'s throne, while hereditary, is not determined by a succession law but rather by consensus of the [[House of Saud]] as to who will be [[Succession to the Saudi Arabian throne|Crown Prince]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]; consensus may change depending on the Crown Prince's actions. Since 2007, the process of establishing the consensus of the House has been institutionalized in the form of the [[Allegiance Council]], comprising the most powerful senior princes, which has the power to disapprove the King's nominee for Crown Prince and substitute its own by simple majority vote.<ref name=\"allegiance\">{{cite web|title=The Allegiance Institution Law|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/archive/2006/transcript/Page4.aspx|publisher=Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Washington, DC|date=20 October 2006|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> In effect, this makes the Saudi monarchy elective within the House of Saud, as the king's eldest son has not become Crown Prince since the death of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in 1953.\n* The [[Maori King Movement]] in [[New Zealand]] chooses a Maori monarch, elected by the [[kaumatua]] of various New Zealand [[iwi]] (tribes). However, every Maori monarch to date has been succeeded by his/her son or daughter, making the position hereditary in effect.\n* [[Wallis and Futuna]] (territories of the [[France|French Republic]]) have traditional heads of the three regions who are elected.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[President for life]]\n* [[Tanistry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!--unused<ref name=\"Fortress Malta: An Island Under Siege, 1940\u20131943\">{{cite book|last=Holland|first=James|title=Fortress Malta: An Island Under Siege, 1940\u20131943|publisher=Miramax Books|year=2003|isbn=1-4013-5186-7}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=\"head-of-state-samoa\">[http://www.head-of-state-samoa.ws/pages/welcome.html Official website of the head of state of Samoa]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"paclii\">[http://www.paclii.org/ws/legis/consol_act/cotisows1960535/ Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708171858/http://www.paclii.org/ws/legis/consol_act/cotisows1960535/ |date=July 8, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"The Emperor: Qualifications\">{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/hre.htm#Qualifications |title=The Emperor: Qualifications |work=The Holy Roman Empire |publisher=Heraldica}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, Volume 9\">{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|title=The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, Volume 9|year=1962|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-08903-1}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web\n    |title=Official Denmark \u2013 The Royal House\n    |url=http://www.um.dk/publikationer/um/english/denmark/kap1/1-1.asp\n    |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227145937/http://www.um.dk/publikationer/um/english/denmark/kap1/1-1.asp\n    |archivedate=2009-02-27\n    |last=Wors\u00f8e\n    |first=Hans H.\n    |publisher=The Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n    |accessdate=2008-01-02\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |title       = The Noble Republic, 1572\u20131795\n |work        = Poland \u2013 The Historical Setting\n |url         = http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/longhist3.html\n |publisher   = Polish Academic Information Center, [[University at Buffalo]]\n |accessdate  = 2008-01-02\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604230420/http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/longhist3.html\n |archivedate = 2011-06-04\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title       = Constitutions, Elections and Legislatures of Poland, 1493\u20131993\n |last        = J\u0119druch\n |first       = Jacek\n |year        = 1998\n |publisher   = EJJ Books\n |isbn        = 0-7818-0637-2\n |url         = http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/JJ.html\n |accessdate  = 2008-01-02\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505194332/http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/JJ.html\n |archivedate = 2006-05-05\n}}\n* {{cite news\n    |title=Norway's elective monarchy\n    |work=The New York Times\n    |date=November 16, 1905\n    |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802EFDD143DE733A25755C1A9679D946497D6CF#\n    |accessdate=2008-01-03\n}}\n\n{{Monarchies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elective Monarchy}}\n[[Category:Elective monarchy| ]]\n[[Category:Monarchy]]\n", "name_user": "2601:646:8882:3c40:9104:2355:2649:fa4", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEvolution)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy"}

Nitzsche produced the band's 1971 [[Crazy Horse (album)|self-titled debut album]] and sang lead vocal on \"Crow Jane Lady\". He left Crazy Horse after the album's commercial failure.\n\nWhile remaining prolific throughout the 1970s, he began to suffer from depression and problems connected to substance abuse. His relationship with Young began to deteriorate during the 1973 support tour for ''Harvest'' that yielded ''Time Fades Away''. During rehearsals, drummer [[Kenneth Buttrey]] demanded a salary of $100,000 to compensate for lost session work, leading Nitzsche (with support from bassist [[Tim Drummond]]) to prevail upon the singer to extend this salary to the other band members. Although Young reluctantly agreed, Nitzsche thought Young never got over it. He frequently spewed obscenities into his vocal mike (leading Young's sound engineers to disconnect it) and often quarreled with [[David Crosby]], who joined the tour's final dates to assist with vocal harmonies. After he publicly castigated Young in a 1974 interview, the two men became estranged for several years and collaborated only sporadically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spectropop.com/JackNitzsche/crawdaddy.htm|title=CRAWDADDY interview|website=Spectropop.com|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Later that year, he was dropped from the [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] roster after recording a song criticizing executive [[Mo Ostin]].

It was released on July 11, 2003, in the United States, and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was directed by [[Stephen Norrington]] and starred [[Sean Connery]] (in his final live-action role before retiring), [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Peta Wilson]], [[Tony Curran]], [[Stuart Townsend]], [[Shane West]], [[Jason Flemyng]] and [[Richard Roxburgh]].\n\nAs with the comic book source material, the film features prominent [[pastiche]] and [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] themes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-v281053|work=Allmovie|title=The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|author=Tobey, Matthew|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref> set in the late 19th century.  It features an assortment of fictional literary characters appropriate to the period who act as [[Victorian era]] [[superhero]]es. It draws on the works of [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Gaston Leroux]] and [[Mark Twain]], albeit all adapted for the film.\n\nThe film grossed over $175&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office, rental revenue of $48.6&nbsp;million, and DVD sales as of 2003 at $36.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1899, a [[Terrorism|terrorist group]] led by the [[Fant\u00f4mas|Fantom]] break into the [[Bank of England]] to steal [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s blueprints of [[Venice]]'s foundations and kidnap several [[German Empire|German]] scientists. The [[British Empire]] sends Sanderson Reed to [[Kenya Colony]] to recruit adventurer and hunter [[Allan Quatermain]], who had retired following the death of his son. Quatermain at first refuses until a group of assassins are sent to kill him, resulting in the death of his longtime friend, Nigel. In [[London]], Quatermain meets \"[[M (James Bond)|M]]\", who reveals that the Fantom plans to start a [[World War I|world war]] by bombing a secret meeting of world leaders in Venice. To prevent this, M is forming the latest generation of the [[History of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], consisting of Quatermain, [[Captain Nemo]], [[Vampire|vampiric]] chemist [[Mina Harker]], and [[The Invisible Man|invisible thief Rodney Skinner]].\n\nThe League travel to the [[London Docklands|London docks]] to recruit [[Dorian Gray]], Mina's former lover who is immortal due to a missing portrait. The Fantom's assassins attack, but the League fend them off, aided by [[U.S. Secret Service]] Agent [[Tom Sawyer]]. Dorian and Sawyer join the League. They then capture [[Edward Hyde (fictional character)|Edward Hyde]] in [[Paris]], who transforms back into his alter ego [[Dr. Jekyll]] and joins the League after being offered [[amnesty]]. The League travel to Venice in Nemo's [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', but it soon becomes clear there may be a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] on board: a camera's [[flash powder]] residue is found in the wheelhouse, and one of Jekyll's transformation formulas disappears. Suspicion falls on the missing Skinner.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' arrives in Venice just as the bombs go off, causing the city to start collapsing in a [[domino effect]]. Sawyer uses Nemo's automobile to stop the destruction, while Quatermain confronts the Fantom, who is unmasked as M. Dorian is also revealed to be the traitor, who then murders Nemo's [[Chief mate|first mate]] [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]] and steals the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} exploration pod. M and Dorian leave a [[phonograph]] recording for the League revealing that their true goal is to ignite the world war, and that Dorian has been collecting physical elements of the League to create Nautiloid, heavily armed version of the ''Nautilus'', invisible spies, army of Hyde, vampire assassins and to sell the superhuman formulas off to the highest bidder. The ''Nautilus'' is damaged by bombs hidden on board, but Hyde saves it by draining the flooded engine rooms. Skinner sends a message to the League, revealing he has snuck aboard the exploration pod and telling them to follow his heading.\n\nThe League reach northern [[Mongolia]], where they reunite with Skinner and plot to destroy M's factory with explosives. Nemo and Hyde rescue the scientists, Skinner sets the explosive charges, and Mina battles and eventually kills Dorian by exposing him to his portrait. Quatermain and Sawyer confront M, identifying him as [[Professor James Moriarty]], [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s archenemy who had taken on a new alias following his [[The Final Problem|alleged death]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed; Quatermain shoots the latter, only to be fatally stabbed by Moriarty. Moriarty flees outside, but Sawyer successfully shoots him, and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies.\n\nQuatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members recall how a [[witch doctor]] had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that [[Africa]] would never let him die. The remaining League members depart, agreeing to continue using their powers for good in the [[20th century|new century]]. Following this, the witch doctor arrives and performs a ritual that summons an unnatural storm, with a bolt of lightning striking the rifle Sawyer left on Quatermain's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Allan Quatermain]]\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as [[Captain Nemo]]\n* [[Peta Wilson]] as [[Mina Harker]]\n* [[Tony Curran]] as [[Rodney Skinner]]\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as [[Dorian Gray]]\n* [[Shane West]] as [[Tom Sawyer]]\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as [[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Edward Hyde]]\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as [[Phantom of the Opera|The Fantom]] / \"[[M (James Bond)|M\"]] / [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]]\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Dante\n* [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Sanderson Reed\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Nigel\n* [[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]] as [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]]\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nFor the script, the character \"The Invisible Man\" was changed to \"An Invisible Man\" since Fox was unable to obtain the rights to the title character of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', and his name was changed from \"Hawley Griffin\" to \"Rodney Skinner\". The [[Fu Manchu]] character was also dropped from the script. At Fox's request, the character of [[Tom Sawyer]] was added for [[United States|American]] audiences and to give the movie some \"youth appeal\". Producer [[Don Murphy]], who described the request as a \"stupid studio note\", later said that the move to add Sawyer was \"brilliant\".<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter Sean Connery previously declined the roles of the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]] in ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' trilogy and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy, the latter of which would have reportedly earned him $450 million, he agreed to appear as Quatermain despite not understanding the script.<ref>Norrington, Stephen (Director) (December 16, 2003).

It features an assortment of fictional literary characters appropriate to the period who act as [[Victorian era]] [[superhero]]es. It draws on the works of [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Gaston Leroux]] and [[Mark Twain]], albeit all adapted for the film.\n\nThe film grossed over $175&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office, rental revenue of $48.6&nbsp;million, and DVD sales as of 2003 at $36.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1899, a [[Terrorism|terrorist group]] led by the [[Fant\u00f4mas|Fantom]] break into the [[Bank of England]] to steal [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s blueprints of [[Venice]]'s foundations and kidnap several [[German Empire|German]] scientists. The [[British Empire]] sends Sanderson Reed to [[Kenya Colony]] to recruit adventurer and hunter [[Allan Quatermain]], who had retired following the death of his son. Quatermain at first refuses until a group of assassins are sent to kill him, resulting in the death of his longtime friend, Nigel. In [[London]], Quatermain meets \"[[M (James Bond)|M]]\", who reveals that the Fantom plans to start a [[World War I|world war]] by bombing a secret meeting of world leaders in Venice. To prevent this, M is forming the latest generation of the [[History of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], consisting of Quatermain, [[Captain Nemo]], [[Vampire|vampiric]] chemist [[Mina Harker]], and [[The Invisible Man|invisible thief Rodney Skinner]].\n\nThe League travel to the [[London Docklands|London docks]] to recruit [[Dorian Gray]], Mina's former lover who is immortal due to a missing portrait. The Fantom's assassins attack, but the League fend them off, aided by [[U.S. Secret Service]] Agent [[Tom Sawyer]]. Dorian and Sawyer join the League. They then capture [[Edward Hyde (fictional character)|Edward Hyde]] in [[Paris]], who transforms back into his alter ego [[Dr. Jekyll]] and joins the League after being offered [[amnesty]]. The League travel to Venice in Nemo's [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', but it soon becomes clear there may be a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] on board: a camera's [[flash powder]] residue is found in the wheelhouse, and one of Jekyll's transformation formulas disappears. Suspicion falls on the missing Skinner.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' arrives in Venice just as the bombs go off, causing the city to start collapsing in a [[domino effect]]. Sawyer uses Nemo's automobile to stop the destruction, while Quatermain confronts the Fantom, who is unmasked as M. Dorian is also revealed to be the traitor, who then murders Nemo's [[Chief mate|first mate]] [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]] and steals the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} exploration pod. M and Dorian leave a [[phonograph]] recording for the League revealing that their true goal is to ignite the world war, and that Dorian has been collecting physical elements of the League to create a heavily armed version of the ''Nautilus'', invisible spies, vampire assassins, and Hyde-like soldiers, and to sell the superhuman formulas off to the highest bidder. The ''Nautilus'' is damaged by bombs hidden on board, but Hyde saves it by draining the flooded engine rooms. Skinner sends a message to the League, revealing he has snuck aboard the exploration pod and telling them to follow his heading.\n\nThe League reach northern [[Mongolia]], where they reunite with Skinner and plot to destroy M's factory with explosives. Nemo and Hyde rescue the scientists, Skinner sets the explosive charges, and Mina battles and eventually kills Dorian by exposing him to his portrait. Quatermain and Sawyer confront M, identifying him as [[Professor James Moriarty]], [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s archenemy who had taken on a new alias following his [[The Final Problem|alleged death]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed; Quatermain shoots the latter, only to be fatally stabbed by Moriarty. Moriarty flees outside, but Sawyer successfully shoots him, and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies.\n\nQuatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members recall how a [[witch doctor]] had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that [[Africa]] would never let him die. The remaining League members depart, agreeing to continue using their powers for good in the [[20th century|new century]]. Following this, the witch doctor arrives and performs a ritual that summons an unnatural storm, with a bolt of lightning striking the rifle Sawyer left on Quatermain's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Allan Quatermain]]\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as [[Captain Nemo]]\n* [[Peta Wilson]] as [[Mina Harker]]\n* [[Tony Curran]] as [[Rodney Skinner]]\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as [[Dorian Gray]]\n* [[Shane West]] as [[Tom Sawyer]]\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as [[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Edward Hyde]]\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as [[Phantom of the Opera|The Fantom]] / \"[[M (James Bond)|M\"]] / [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]]\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Dante\n* [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Sanderson Reed\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Nigel\n* [[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]] as [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]]\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nFor the script, the character \"The Invisible Man\" was changed to \"An Invisible Man\" since Fox was unable to obtain the rights to the title character of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', and his name was changed from \"Hawley Griffin\" to \"Rodney Skinner\". The [[Fu Manchu]] character was also dropped from the script. At Fox's request, the character of [[Tom Sawyer]] was added for [[United States|American]] audiences and to give the movie some \"youth appeal\". Producer [[Don Murphy]], who described the request as a \"stupid studio note\", later said that the move to add Sawyer was \"brilliant\".<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter Sean Connery previously declined the roles of the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]] in ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' trilogy and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy, the latter of which would have reportedly earned him $450 million, he agreed to appear as Quatermain despite not understanding the script.<ref>Norrington, Stephen (Director) (December 16, 2003).

He often mourns over his status as a Taboo Child, feeling responsible for the amasogi that are born around him and feeling greatly distressed upon seeing someone suffer from a severe Curse Backlash. He's quite brave, often stepping up and selflessly throwing himself into the fray to accomplish his mission as Kamioka's exorcist, as well as frequently prioritizing the safety of the host's and the others above everything else. Over the series, Kazuya comes to hold a very strong sentimental value for those he met upon becoming an exorcist, like Kukuri, Kokuyou and Kiriha. He becomes exceedingly concerned for their well-being to the point of being thrown into a great rage if he feels they are endangered.\n;{{nihongo|Kiriha|\u6850\u8449}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naomi \u014czora]]<ref name=\"Cast1\"/>|[[Sarah Wiedenheft]]<ref name=\"Simuldub\"/>}}\n:Kiriha is a tsukumogami who used to be in a form of a white cherry blossom obi that Kazuya carries around, in a human form she appears as a teenager who is very powerful and is capable of taking down amoasogies and other tsukumogami. She has a malevolent side where she enjoys roughing up others especially Kazuya and Kukuri, when in her chibi form, she is basically arrogant, brash, boastful, possessive, lazy, ill tempered and curses a lot, as an obi she use to belong to kazuya's mother where the scent serves as a memento to Kazuya. She also has a perverted side where she occasionally enjoys sexually harassing Kazuya when they are alone and Kukuri as well though the former is due to her infatuation with him.\n;{{nihongo|Ky\u014dka|\u97ff\u83ef}}\n:Ky\u014dka is a flute tsukumogami who was originally a member of Mayoiga. She first appeared as part of a radical group who would wait for Kukuri to weaken and attacked Kazuya and Kukuri's other defenders. However, Kazuya defeats her and she exhausts her spirit powers, turning back into a flute. Kazuya spares her because he understood that she attacked Kukuri to protect her fellow tsukumogami at Mayoiga, who were running out of spirit power and returning to their original forms. For this reason, Kukuri returns Ky\u014dka's flute form to Kazuya believing that Ky\u014dka can be revived. Kazuya carries the flute with him until Kazuya is imprisoned at Tsuzura Temple along other tsukumogami users who viewed their tsukumogami as partners rather than tools. Ky\u014dka awakens and helps the group escape from their prison and later partners with Kazuya since Kiriha had been destroyed in a previous confrontation with a resurrected Kanaka Kagami. After she partners with Kazuya she acts as a typical tsundere until she comes to understand him and starts to like him.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n;{{nihongo|Chisato Chikaishi|\u8fd1\u77f3 \u5343\u91cc|Chikaishi Chisato}}\n:{{voiced by|Noriko Shibasaki<ref name=\"Cast1\"/>|Megan Shipman<ref name=\"Simuldub\"/>}}\n: She is Kazuya's childhood friend who has a crush on him unbeknownst to Kazuya also she is the Class Representative of Kamioka East Middle School's Class 2-2.\n;{{nihongo|Kukuri|\u304f\u304f\u308a}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yurika Kubo]]<ref name=\"Cast1\"/>|[[Apphia Yu]]<ref name=\"Simuldub\"/>}}\n:[[Kukurihime no Kami]] is the god of the land (''ubusunagami''), protecting Kazuya's city. she specializes in using water spells and attacks, in her adult form she is very powerful where she can even beat Kiriha, she would always be on a Noh Mask that enhances her power.

She and her familiar Kokuyo used to live in a shrine but after suffering from financial difficulties, they both lived in a park, then in Kazuya's house after their temporary home was demolished, unlike Kiriha who bums around, she is very helpful with household chores, which pleases Kazuya's sister, Kasumi.

He often mourns over his status as a Taboo Child, feeling responsible for the amasogi that are born around him and feeling greatly distressed upon seeing someone suffer from a severe Curse Backlash. He's quite brave, often stepping up and selflessly throwing himself into the fray to accomplish his mission as Kamioka's exorcist, as well as frequently prioritizing the safety of the host's and the others above everything else. Over the series, Kazuya comes to hold a very strong sentimental value for those he met upon becoming an exorcist, like Kukuri, Kokuyou and Kiriha. He becomes exceedingly concerned for their well-being to the point of being thrown into a great rage if he feels they are endangered.\n;{{nihongo|Kiriha|\u6850\u8449}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naomi \u014czora]]<ref name=\"Cast1\"/>|[[Sarah Wiedenheft]]<ref name=\"Simuldub\"/>}}\n:Kiriha is a tsukumogami who used to be in a form of a white cherry blossom obi that Kazuya carries around, in a human form she appears as a teenager who is very powerful and is capable of taking down amoasogies and other tsukumogami. She has a malevolent side where she enjoys roughing up others especially Kazuya and Kukuri, when in her chibi form, she is basically arrogant, brash, boastful, possessive, lazy, ill tempered and curses a lot, as an obi she use to belong to kazuya's mother where the scent serves as a memento to Kazuya. She also has a perverted side where she occasionally enjoys sexually harassing Kazuya when they are alone and Kukuri as well though the former is due to her infatuation with him.\n;{{nihongo|Ky\u014dka|\u97ff\u83ef}}\n:Ky\u014dka is a flute tsukumogami who was originally a member of Mayoiga. She first appeared as part of a radical group who would wait for Kukuri to weaken and attacked Kazuya and Kukuri's other defenders. However, Kazuya defeats her and she exhausts her spirit powers, turning back into a flute. Kazuya spares her because he understood that she attacked Kukuri to protect her fellow tsukumogami at Mayoiga, who were running out of spirit power and returning to their original forms. For this reason, Kukuri returns Ky\u014dka's flute form to Kazuya believing that Ky\u014dka can be revived. Kazuya carries the flute with him until Kazuya is imprisoned at Tsuzura Temple along other tsukumogami users who viewed their tsukumogami as partners rather than tools. Ky\u014dka awakens and helps the group escape from their prison and later partners with Kazuya since Kiriha had been destroyed in a previous confrontation with a resurrected Kanaka Kagami. After she partners with Kazuya she acts as a typical tsundere until she comes to understand him and starts to like him.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n;{{nihongo|Chisato Chikaishi|\u8fd1\u77f3 \u5343\u91cc|Chikaishi Chisato}}\n:{{voiced by|Noriko Shibasaki<ref name=\"Cast1\"/>|Megan Shipman<ref name=\"Simuldub\"/>}}\n: She is Kazuya's childhood friend who has a crush on him unbeknownst to Kazuya also she is the Class Representative of Kamioka East Middle School's Class 2-2.\n;{{nihongo|Kukuri|\u304f\u304f\u308a}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yurika Kubo]]<ref name=\"Cast1\"/>|[[Apphia Yu]]<ref name=\"Simuldub\"/>}}\n:[[Kukurihime no Kami]] is the god of the land (''ubusunagami''), protecting Kazuya's city. she specializes in using water spells and attacks, in her adult form she is very powerful where she can even beat Kiriha, she would always be on a Noh Mask that enhances her power. But in her chibi form, she is basically too weak and is no match for Kiriha even in her chibi form, she would often find herself being on the receiving end of Kiriha's bullying where she would end up screaming in agony. She and her familiar Kokuyo used to live in a shrine but after suffering from financial difficulties, they both lived in a park, then in Kazuya's house after their temporary home was demolished, unlike Kiriha who bums around, she is very helpful with household chores, which pleases Kazuya's sister, Kasumi.
