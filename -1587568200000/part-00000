Dawidowicz|url=http://digifindingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109169|publisher=[[American Jewish Historical Society]]|accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDawidowicz's first interests were poetry and literature. She attended Hunter College from 1932 to 1936 and obtained a B.A. in English. She went on to study for a M.A. at Columbia University, but abandoned her studies because of concerns over events in Europe. At the encouragement of her mentor, the historian [[Jacob Shatzky]], Dawidowicz decided to focus on history, especially Jewish history. Dawidowicz made the decision to learn Yiddish, and at Shatzky's urging, she relocated to [[Wilno]], Poland (present-day [[Vilnius]], Lithuania) in 1938 to work at the Yiddish Scientific Institute (known by its Yiddish acronym as the [[YIVO]]). With the help of Shatzky she became a research fellow there.<ref name=\"LD\"/>\n\nDawidowicz lived in Wilno until August 1939 when she returned to the United States just weeks before the war broke out. During her time at the YIVO, she became close to three of the leading scholars there, namely [[Zelig Kalmanovich]], [[Max Weinreich]] and [[Zalman Reisen|Zalmen Reisen]]. Weinreich escaped [[the Holocaust]] because he went to New York to establish a branch of the YIVO there before World War II, but Kalmanovich and Reisen perished. Dawidowicz had been close to Kalmanovich and his family, whom she reportedly described as being her real parents.<ref name=\"LD\"/> From 1940 until 1946, Dawidowicz worked as an assistant to a research director at the New York City office of the YIVO. During the war, like most Americans, she was aware of the Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Europe, although it was not until after the war that she became aware of the full extent of the Holocaust.<ref name=\"LD\"/>\n\n===Following World War II===\nIn 1946, Dawidowicz traveled back to Europe, where she worked for the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] as an aid worker among the [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Jewish survivors]] in the [[Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe|Displaced Persons (DP) camps]]. She helped the survivors to re-create schools and libraries.<ref name=nyt-article/> Over a period of months in Frankfurt, she examined books that had been looted from Jewish institutions by the Nazis and identified those to be returned to the YIVO headquarters in New York,<ref name=\"LD\"/> recovering in this way vast collections of books.<ref name=nyt-article/>\n\nIn 1947, she returned to the U.S. and on January 3, 1948, she married a Polish Jew, Szymon Dawidowicz. Upon her return to the U.S. she worked as a researcher for the novelist [[John Hersey]]'s book ''The Wall'', a dramatization of the 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. From 1948 until 1960, Dawidowicz worked as a historical researcher for the [[American Jewish Committee]]. During the same period, Dawidowicz wrote frequently for ''Commentary'', the ''New York Times'' and the ''New York Times Book Review''.<ref name=\"LD\"/>\n\nAn enthusiastic fan of the [[New York Mets]], Dawidowicz lived the rest of her life in New York. In 1985, she founded the Fund for the Translation of Jewish Literature from Yiddish and Hebrew into English.

Dawidowicz maintained that from the Middle Ages onward, German Christian society and culture were suffused with antisemitism and there was a direct link from medieval [[pogroms]] to the [[Extermination camp|Nazi death camps]] of the 1940s.<ref name=\"LD\"/>\n\nCiting [[Fritz Fischer]], Dawidowicz argued that there were powerful lines of continuity in German history and there was a ''[[Sonderweg]]'' (Special Path), which inevitably led Germany to [[Nazism]].<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy ''The Holocaust and the Historians'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1981, pgs. 63-65</ref>\n\nDawidowicz criticized what she considered to be revisionist historians as incorrect and/or sympathetic to the Nazis, as well as German historians who sought to minimize German complicity in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] attempt to annihilate Europe's Jews.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nFor Dawidowicz, Nazism was the essence of ''total evil,'' and she wrote that the Nazi movement was the \"... daemon let loose in society, Cain in corporate embodiment.\"<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy ''The Holocaust and Historians'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1981, pgs. 20-1</ref>\nRegarding foreign policy questions, she sharply disagreed with [[A.J.P. Taylor]] over his book ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]''. In even stronger terms, she condemned the American [[neo-Nazi]] historian [[David Hoggan]] for his book ''War Forced on Germany'' as well as [[David Irving]]'s revisionist ''[[Hitler's War]]'', which suggested Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust.\n\nIn her view, historians who took a functionalist line on the origins of the Holocaust question were guilty of ignoring their responsibility to historical truth.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''The Holocaust and Historians'', ibid., pg. 146</ref>\n\n===Disputes with Arno Mayer===\nDawidowicz was a leading critic of the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]]'s account of the Holocaust in his 1988 book ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' arguing that Mayer played up anti-communism at the expense of antisemitism as an explanation for the Holocaust.<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992, pgs. 123-4</ref>\n\nDawidowicz titled her review of ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' in the October 1989 edition of ''Commentary'' as \"Perversions of the Holocaust\".<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pg. vii</ref> Dawidowicz argued against Mayer that the historical evidence shows that Hitler was not convinced that the war was lost as early as December 1941 and that Mayer's theory is anachronistic.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pgs. 127-8</ref>\n\nDawidowicz commented that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' had been massacring Jews since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and that Mayer's claim that the Jews were only surrogate victims due to Germany's inability to defeat the Soviet Union was, in her opinion, rubbish.<ref>Dawidowicz, ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pg. 128</ref>\n\nDawidowicz attacked Mayer for saying that more Jews died at Auschwitz from disease than from mass gassing and for supporting [[Holocaust denial]] by writing that Holocaust survivor testimony was highly unreliable as a historical source.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pgs. 129-30</ref>\n\nDawidowicz questioned Mayer's motives in listing the works of [[Arthur Butz]] and [[Paul Rassinier]] in his bibliography.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid. pg. 130</ref>\n\nDawidowicz ended her review of ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' by accusing Mayer of excusing German racism, rationalizing the Nazi dictatorship, of portraying Soviet Jews as better off than they were under the Soviet dictatorship, and by presenting the Holocaust as due to reasonable political goals instead of, as she believed, being an ideological decision fueled by fanatical antisemitism.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pgs. 131-2</ref>\n\n===Other===\nShe criticized the British historian [[Norman Davies]], the author of ''[[God's Playground|God's Playground: A History of Poland]]'', for \"his virtuosity in erasing Polish antisemitism from the history books he writes\" and for peppering some of his writing \"with anti-Semitic tidbits.\"<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/us/scholar-says-his-views-on-jews-cost-him-a-post-at-stanford.html</ref><ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy. \"The Curious Case of Marek Edelman\", pages 66-69 from ''Commentary'', March 1987.</ref> [[Ronald Hilton]], professor emeritus at Stanford University replied: \"Davies is not anti-Semitic, his reputation for fairness is recognized internationally.\" He also added: \"People are frightened to speak up about this.\" Davies \"absolutely\" denied being antisemitic.<ref name=\"Lindsey\">{{cite web |work=A lawsuit by a British scholar who contends he was denied a professorship because Jewish faculty members considered his work insensitive toward Jews and unacceptably defensive of Polish gentiles in World War II has raised unusual issues of academic freedom at Stanford University |author=Robert Lindsey |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 13, 1987 |title=Scholar says his views on Jews cost him a post at Stanford |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/us/scholar-says-his-views-on-jews-cost-him-a-post-at-stanford.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same period, Dawidowicz denounced the work of the philosopher [[Ernst Nolte]], whom she accused of seeking to justify the Holocaust. In her ''[[The War Against the Jews|The War Against the Jews 1933-1945]]'' (1975), she writes that antisemitism has had a long history within [[Christianity]].<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy ''The War Against the Jews 1933-1945''. Bantam: 1986, pg. 23; {{ISBN|0-553-34532-X}}.</ref>\n\nIn her opinion, the line of \"anti-Semitic descent\" from [[Martin Luther]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] was \"easy to draw\". She wrote that Hitler and Luther were both obsessed by the \"demonologized universe\" inhabited by Jews and that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence because they derived from a common history of [[Antisemitism|Judenhass]].\n\n===Criticism of Dawidowicz===\n[[Raul Hilberg]] criticized Dawidowicz for her work ''The War Against the Jews'', stating that it builds \"largely on secondary sources and conveying nothing whatever that could be called new,\" and then going on to say in regards to Dawidowicz's portrayal of Jewish resistance and resisters that she included \"soup ladlers and all others in the ghettos who staved off starvation and despair.\" Hilberg suggests that \"nostalgic Jewish readers [would find here] vaguely consoling words, [which] could be easily clutched by all those who did not wish to look deeper.\" He then lists over 20 key authors on the subjects that Dawidowicz covers, that she did not use as references in her own work. Hilberg ends on the subject of Dawidowicz stating \"To be sure, Dawidowicz has not been taken all that seriously by historians\".<ref>The Politics of Memory: The Journey of a Holocaust Historian page 142 to 147</ref>\n\n==Books by Dawidowicz==\nHer books include ''[[The War Against the Jews|The War Against the Jews 1933-1945]]'', her best-selling 1975 history of the Holocaust, and ''The Holocaust and the Historians'', a study of Holocaust [[historiography]].\n\nA collection of her essays relating to Jewish history, ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', was published posthumously in 1992. Dawidowicz wrote ''The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe'' to document Jewish civilization in Eastern Europe before its destruction during the Holocaust.<ref name=jwa>{{cite web|last=Adler|first=Eliyana|title=LUCY S.

Mayer]]'s account of the Holocaust in his 1988 book ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' arguing that Mayer played up anti-communism at the expense of antisemitism as an explanation for the Holocaust.<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992, pgs. 123-4</ref>\n\nDawidowicz titled her review of ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' in the October 1989 edition of ''Commentary'' as \"Perversions of the Holocaust\".<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pg. vii</ref> Dawidowicz argued against Mayer that the historical evidence shows that Hitler was not convinced that the war was lost as early as December 1941 and that Mayer's theory is anachronistic.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pgs. 127-8</ref>\n\nDawidowicz commented that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' had been massacring Jews since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and that Mayer's claim that the Jews were only surrogate victims due to Germany's inability to defeat the Soviet Union was, in her opinion, rubbish.<ref>Dawidowicz, ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pg. 128</ref>\n\nDawidowicz attacked Mayer for saying that more Jews died at Auschwitz from disease than from mass gassing and for supporting [[Holocaust denial]] by writing that Holocaust survivor testimony was highly unreliable as a historical source.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pgs. 129-30</ref>\n\nDawidowicz questioned Mayer's motives in listing the works of [[Arthur Butz]] and [[Paul Rassinier]] in his bibliography.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid. pg. 130</ref>\n\nDawidowicz ended her review of ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' by accusing Mayer of excusing German racism, rationalizing the Nazi dictatorship, of portraying Soviet Jews as better off than they were under the Soviet dictatorship, and by presenting the Holocaust as due to reasonable political goals instead of, as she believed, being an ideological decision fueled by fanatical antisemitism.<ref>Dawidowicz. ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', ibid., pgs. 131-2</ref>\n\n===Other===\nShe criticized the British historian [[Norman Davies]], the author of ''[[God's Playground|God's Playground: A History of Poland]]'', for \"his virtuosity in erasing Polish antisemitism from the history books he writes\" and for peppering some of his writing \"with anti-Semitic tidbits.\"<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/us/scholar-says-his-views-on-jews-cost-him-a-post-at-stanford.html</ref><ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy. \"The Curious Case of Marek Edelman\", pages 66-69 from ''Commentary'', March 1987.</ref> [[Ronald Hilton]], professor emeritus at Stanford University replied: \"Davies is not anti-Semitic, his reputation for fairness is recognized internationally.\" He also added: \"People are frightened to speak up about this.\" Davies \"absolutely\" denied being antisemitic.<ref name=\"Lindsey\">{{cite web |work=A lawsuit by a British scholar who contends he was denied a professorship because Jewish faculty members considered his work insensitive toward Jews and unacceptably defensive of Polish gentiles in World War II has raised unusual issues of academic freedom at Stanford University |author=Robert Lindsey |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 13, 1987 |title=Scholar says his views on Jews cost him a post at Stanford |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/us/scholar-says-his-views-on-jews-cost-him-a-post-at-stanford.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same period, Dawidowicz denounced the work of the philosopher [[Ernst Nolte]], whom she accused of seeking to justify the Holocaust. In her ''[[The War Against the Jews|The War Against the Jews 1933-1945]]'' (1975), she writes that antisemitism has had a long history within [[Christianity]].<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy ''The War Against the Jews 1933-1945''. Bantam: 1986, pg. 23; {{ISBN|0-553-34532-X}}.</ref>\n\nIn her opinion, the line of \"anti-Semitic descent\" from [[Martin Luther]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] was \"easy to draw\". She wrote that Hitler and Luther were both obsessed by the \"demonologized universe\" inhabited by Jews and that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence because they derived from a common history of [[Antisemitism|Judenhass]].\n\n===Criticism of Dawidowicz===\n[[Raul Hilberg]] criticized Dawidowicz for her work ''The War Against the Jews'', stating that it builds \"largely on secondary sources and conveying nothing whatever that could be called new,\" and then going on to say in regards to Dawidowicz's portrayal of Jewish resistance and resisters that she included \"soup ladlers and all others in the ghettos who staved off starvation and despair.\" Hilberg suggests that \"nostalgic Jewish readers [would find here] vaguely consoling words, [which] could be easily clutched by all those who did not wish to look deeper.\" He then lists over 20 key authors on the subjects that Dawidowicz covers, that she did not use as references in her own work. Hilberg ends on the subject of Dawidowicz stating \"To be sure, Dawidowicz has not been taken all that seriously by historians\".<ref>The Politics of Memory: The Journey of a Holocaust Historian page 142 to 147</ref>\n\n==Books by Dawidowicz==\nHer books include ''[[The War Against the Jews|The War Against the Jews 1933-1945]]'', her best-selling 1975 history of the Holocaust, and ''The Holocaust and the Historians'', a study of Holocaust [[historiography]].\n\nA collection of her essays relating to Jewish history, ''What Is the Use of Jewish History?'', was published posthumously in 1992. Dawidowicz wrote ''The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe'' to document Jewish civilization in Eastern Europe before its destruction during the Holocaust.<ref name=jwa>{{cite web|last=Adler|first=Eliyana|title=LUCY S.

It lies among the northern ranges of the [[Karancs Hills]] in its valley. Karancsalja is bordered by [[Karancsber\u00e9ny]] in the north, [[Karancslapujt\u0151]] in the west, [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] in the east and [[Etes]] in the south. It lies near the border between Hungary and Slovakia. \n\nKarancsalja must have been inhabited since the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]], since its area - the northern side of the valley - is slightly raised from its surroundings, thus providing a suitable place for settlement.\n\nLike the settlements of the Karancs region, Karancsalja was a typical village on a highway at the beginning of its history, and it was established along the road connecting the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] and the [[North Hungarian Mountains|Highlands]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, this was an important route for the county and even for the country. The traffic here had considerable economic power.\n\nDespite its favorable geographical conditions, Karancsalja did not become a large settlement, although in the second half of the 19th century, with the emergence and rapid development of mining, the village began to grow. More than 1500 people live in Karancsalja today.\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located in the northeastern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, in the valley of the Dobroda stream, in the valley of the Karancs Hills, five kilometers northwest of Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Karancsalja is by road 2206 between [[Litke, Hungary|Litke]] and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, it is the first settlement from the county capital.\n\nIt is also accessible from the main road 22, from where one has to turn east-northeast in [[S\u00e1g\u00fajfalu]], to the 7 km-long side road 22109 through Etes.\n\nFootpaths and forest tracks are available from the village to the [[Karancs Hills]].\u00a0\n\n== History==\nKarancsalja is a settlement of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian age]] in the valley of the Dobroda stream.\n\nIt was named after the 727 meters high [[Karancs]] peak, which is situated a few kilometers northeast of the village, on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, is also called \"[[Pal\u00f3c]] Olympus\".\n\nThe village already existed in the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian period]]. According to legend, in 1241 King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|Bela IV]] found refuge there one night when he had to flee after bloody [[battle of Mohi]] against the [[Tat\u00e1rj\u00e1r\u00e1s (disambiguation)|Tatars]]. Tradition holds that the King's daughter, [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|St. Margaret]], built the Margaret Chapel on the summit of Karancs to commemorate this famous event.\n\nThe history of the village during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] and in the late medieval period is rather unexamined.\n\nIn 1548 it was owned by Ferenc Bebek.\n\nIn 1715, the census recorded 8, and in 1720, 14 Hungarian households.\n\nIn 1770 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Jankovich, at the beginning of the 19th century Antal Jankovics, and in the early 1900s G\u00e9za Balla were the most important landowners of the village.\n\nThe mansion in the village was built by Mikl\u00f3s Jankovich at the beginning of the 19th century, but was rebuilt by it\u2019s new owner in 1909.\n\nIn 1873 a large cholera epidemic devastated the settlement.\n\nThe coal mines on the outskirts of Karancsalja were of great importance to the life of the population, providing a livelihood for many people in the 19th and 20th centuries. At the end of 1944, the Karancslejt\u0151s mine at Etes, a few kilometers from the village, was a scene of a \u00a0tragic event when seven of the miners who refused to work, in order to get better conditions, were shot dead.\u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karancsalja.hu/telepulesunk/ismerteto|title=Official website of the village Karancsalja|last=|first=|date=|website=www.karancsalja.hu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2001, 99% of the population of the settlement declared themselves to be Hungarian and 1% Romani.\n\nAt the 2011 census, 88.5% of the population said they were Hungarian, 2.9% Romani, 0.3% German, 0.3% Slovak (11.5% did not answer; due to dual identities, the total may be more than 100%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/apps/hntr.telepules?p_lang=EN&p_id=18625|title=Detailed Gazetteer of Hungary|website=www.ksh.hu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe distribution of religion was as follows: Roman Catholic 47.4%, Reformed 1.9%, Lutheran 0.8%, non-denominational 22.3% (25.6% did not answer). \n\n== The village today ==\nThe infrastructure (water, gas, drainage, telephone, cable TV) is fully developed, the roads have been renovated. A pavement was built on an 800 m long section in the center of the village.\n\nThe flag and coat of arms of the village were consecrated in 2000, and a memorial erected in honor of the victims of World War I & II was completed that year, and an ornamental park was established soon after. In 2003, the sports field was renovated.\n\nA popular excursion destination is the \"Tavas\" recreation park, where cultural and sports programs are organized on public holidays. The most visited events in the village are the Village Day on the last Saturday of July, as well as the harvest parade and ball in early October.\n\nIn 2015, the Village Library opened in a new location. The bookstore, the children\u2019s corner, the furniture and the internet browsing places create opportunities for everyone from young to old. The installed internet creates a direct connection with the Balassi B\u00e1lint County Library.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=18625 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County]]\n\n== References ==\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n| subdivision_type                = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n| subdivision_name                = {{HUN}}\n| timezone                        = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset                      = +1\n| timezone_DST                    = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST                  = +2\n| official_name                   = Karancsalja\n| map                             = [[Image:NogradMegye.png|center|thumb|275px|Location of N\u00f3gr\u00e1d county in Hungary]]\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Counties of Hungary|County]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d (county)|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]]\n| area_total_km2                  = 12.54\n| population_total                = 1454\n| population_as_of                = 2019\n| population_density_km2          = 115.9\n| postal_code_type                = [[Postal code]]\n| postal_code                     = 3181\n| area_code                       = 32\n| pushpin_map                     = Hungary\n| pushpin_label_position          = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location of Karancsalja\n| pushpin_mapsize                 = \n| coordinates                     = {{coord|48.13194|19.75614|region:HU|display=inline,title}}\n| name                            = \n| image_shield                    = [[Image:HUN Karancsalja C\u00edmer.svg|center||275px]]\n}}\n\n'''Karancsalja''' is a village in [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d (county)|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, [[Hungary]], in [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n District]].\n\nIt is located in the northern part of N\u00f3gr\u00e1d county, in the heart of the former [[Pal\u00f3c|Pal\u00f3cf\u00f6ld]] region.

Tradition holds that the King's daughter, [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|St. Margaret]], built the Margaret Chapel on the summit of Karancs to commemorate this famous event.\n\nThe history of the village during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] and in the late medieval period is rather unexamined.\n\nIn 1548 it was owned by Ferenc Bebek.\n\nIn 1715, the census recorded 8, and in 1720, 14 Hungarian households.\n\nIn 1770 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Jankovich, at the beginning of the 19th century Antal Jankovics, and in the early 1900s G\u00e9za Balla were the most important landowners of the village.\n\nThe mansion in the village was built by Mikl\u00f3s Jankovich at the beginning of the 19th century, but was rebuilt by it\u2019s new owner in 1909.\n\nIn 1873 a large cholera epidemic devastated the settlement.\n\nThe coal mines on the outskirts of Karancsalja were of great importance to the life of the population, providing a livelihood for many people in the 19th and 20th centuries. At the end of 1944, the Karancslejt\u0151s mine at Etes, a few kilometers from the village, was a scene of a \u00a0tragic event when seven of the miners who refused to work, in order to get better conditions, were shot dead.\u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karancsalja.hu/telepulesunk/ismerteto|title=Official website of the village Karancsalja|last=|first=|date=|website=www.karancsalja.hu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2001, 99% of the population of the settlement declared themselves to be Hungarian and 1% Romani.\n\nAt the 2011 census, 88.5% of the population said they were Hungarian, 2.9% Romani, 0.3% German, 0.3% Slovak (11.5% did not answer; due to dual identities, the total may be more than 100%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/apps/hntr.telepules?p_lang=EN&p_id=18625|title=Detailed Gazetteer of Hungary|website=www.ksh.hu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe distribution of religion was as follows: Roman Catholic 47.4%, Reformed 1.9%, Lutheran 0.8%, non-denominational 22.3% (25.6% did not answer). \n\n== The village today ==\nThe infrastructure (water, gas, drainage, telephone, cable TV) is fully developed, the roads have been renovated. A pavement was built on an 800 m long section in the center of the village.\n\nThe flag and coat of arms of the village were consecrated in 2000, and a memorial erected in honor of the victims of World War I & II was completed that year, and an ornamental park was established soon after. In 2003, the sports field was renovated.\n\nA popular excursion destination is the \"Tavas\" recreation park, where cultural and sports programs are organized on public holidays. The most visited events in the village are the Village Day on the last Saturday of July, as well as the harvest parade and ball in early October.\n\nIn 2015, the Village Library opened in a new location. The bookstore, the children\u2019s corner, the furniture and the internet browsing places create opportunities for everyone from young to old. The installed internet creates a direct connection with the Balassi B\u00e1lint County Library.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=18625 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County]]\n\n== References ==\n", "name_user": "Znagy88", "label": "safe", "comment": "adding pronunciation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karancsalja"}

Surface waves decay more slowly with distance than body waves, which travel in three dimensions.\n* Particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so surface waves tend to cause more damage.\n\n=== Body waves ===\nBody waves travel through the interior of the Earth along paths controlled by the material properties in terms of [[density]] and [[Young's modulus|modulus]] (stiffness). The density and modulus, in turn, vary according to temperature, composition, and material phase.  This effect resembles the [[refraction]] of [[light wave]]s. Two types of particle motion result in two types of body waves: '''''Primary''''' and '''''Secondary''''' waves.\n\n==== Primary waves ====\n{{Main|P-wave}}\nPrimary waves (P-waves) are compressional waves that are [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] in nature.  [[P-waves]] are pressure waves that travel faster than other waves through the earth to arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name \"Primary\". These waves can travel through any type of material, including fluids, and can travel nearly 1.7 times faster than the [[S-waves]]. In air, they take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the [[speed of sound]]. Typical speeds are 330&nbsp;m/s in air, 1450&nbsp;m/s in water and about 5000&nbsp;m/s in [[granite]].\n\n==== Secondary waves ====\n{{Main|S-wave}}\nSecondary waves (S-waves) are shear waves that are [[transverse wave|transverse]] in nature. Following an earthquake event, S-waves arrive at seismograph stations after the faster-moving P-waves and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Depending on the propagational direction, the wave can take on different surface characteristics; for example, in the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S-waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses. S-waves are slower than P-waves, and speeds are typically around 60% of that of P-waves in any given material. Shear waves can't travel through any liquid medium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/static/earthquakes/cur-seismic.html|title=Seismic Waves|publisher=[[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]]|accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref> so the absence of S-wave in earth's outer core suggests a liquid state.\n\n=== Surface waves ===\nSeismic surface waves travel along the Earth's surface. They can be classified as a form of [[Surface wave#Mechanical waves|mechanical surface wave]]s. They are called surface waves, as they diminish as they get further from the surface. They travel more slowly than seismic body waves (P and S). In large earthquakes, surface waves can have an amplitude of several centimeters.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sammis, C.G.|author2=Henyey, T.L.|title=Geophysics Field Measurements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOaUVakFYwkC&pg=PA12|date=1987|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-086012-1|page=12}}</ref>\n\n==== Rayleigh waves ====\n{{Main|Rayleigh wave}} \nRayleigh waves, also called ground roll, are surface waves that travel as ripples with motions that are similar to those of waves on the surface of water (note, however, that the associated particle motion at shallow depths is retrograde, and that the restoring force in Rayleigh and in other seismic waves is elastic, not gravitational as for water waves). The existence of these waves was predicted by John William Strutt, [[Lord Rayleigh]], in 1885. They are slower than body waves, roughly 90% of the velocity of S waves for typical homogeneous elastic media. In a layered medium (like the crust and [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]]) the velocity of the Rayleigh waves depends on their frequency and wavelength. See also [[Lamb waves]].\n\n==== Love waves ====\n{{Main|Love wave}}\nLove waves are horizontally [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] [[shear wave]]s (SH waves), existing only in the presence of a [[semi-infinite]] medium overlain by an upper layer of finite thickness.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Sheriff, R. E., Geldart, L. P. | year=1995 | title=Exploration Seismology |edition=2nd | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-46826-4 |page= 52}}</ref>  They are named after [[A.E.H. Love]], a British mathematician who created a mathematical model of the waves in 1911.  They usually travel slightly faster than Rayleigh waves, about 90% of the S wave velocity, and have the largest amplitude.\n\n==== Stoneley waves ====\n{{Main|Stoneley wave}}\nA Stoneley wave is a type of boundary wave (or interface wave) that propagates along a solid-fluid boundary or, under specific conditions, also along a solid-solid boundary. Amplitudes of Stoneley waves have their maximum values at the boundary between the two contacting media and decay exponentially towards the depth of each of them. These waves can be generated along the walls of a fluid-filled [[borehole]], being an important source of coherent noise in [[Vertical seismic profile|VSPs]] and making up the low frequency component of the source in [[sonic logging]].<ref>[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=Stoneley%20wave Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Stoneley wave.]</ref>\nThe equation for Stoneley waves was first given by Dr. Robert Stoneley (1894\u20131976), Emeritus Professor of Seismology, Cambridge.<ref>[http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/pid/5825;jsessionid=B80DF900AFFC974028AEFB7138FB1BDF Robert Stoneley, 1929 \u2013 2008.. Obituary of his son with reference to discovery of Stoneley waves.]</ref>\n\n==== Normal modes ====\n[[File:Fundametal toroidal oscillation Earth.gif|thumb|right|The sense of motion for toroidal <sub>0</sub>T<sub>1</sub> oscillation for two moments of time.]]\n[[File:Fundamental spheroidal oscillation Earth.gif|thumb|right|The scheme of motion for spheroidal <sub>0</sub>S<sub>2</sub> oscillation.Dashed lines give nodal (zero) lines. Arrows give the sense of motion.]]\nFree oscillations of the Earth are [[standing wave]]s, the result of interference between two surface waves traveling in opposite directions. Interference of Rayleigh waves results in ''spheroidal oscillation S'' while interference of Love waves gives ''toroidal oscillation T''. The modes of oscillations are specified by three numbers, e.g.,  <sub>n</sub>S<sub>l</sub><sup>m</sup>, where ''l'' is the angular order number (or ''spherical harmonic degree'', see [[Spherical harmonics]] for more details). The number ''m'' is the azimuthal order number. It may take on 2''l''+1 values from -''l'' to +''l''. The number ''n'' is the ''radial order number''. It means the wave with ''n'' zero crossings in radius. For spherically symmetric Earth the period for given ''n'' and ''l'' does not depend on ''m''.\n\nSome examples of spheroidal oscillations are the  \"breathing\" mode <sub>0</sub>S<sub>0</sub>, which involves an expansion and contraction of the whole Earth, and has a period of about 20 minutes; and the \"rugby\" mode <sub>0</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, which involves expansions along two alternating directions, and has a period of about 54 minutes. The mode <sub>0</sub>S<sub>1</sub> does not exist because it would require a change in the center of gravity, which would require an external force.<ref name=Shearer2009ch8/>\n\nOf the fundamental toroidal modes, <sub>0</sub>T<sub>1</sub> represents changes in Earth's rotation rate; although this occurs, it is much too slow to be useful in seismology. The mode <sub>0</sub>T<sub>2</sub> describes a twisting of the northern and southern hemispheres relative to each other; it has a period of about 44 minutes.<ref name=Shearer2009ch8/>\n\nThe first observations of free oscillations of the Earth were done during the great [[Chile earthquake 1960|1960 earthquake in Chile]]. Presently periods of thousands of modes are known. These data are used for determining some large scale structures of the Earth interior.\n\n=== P and S waves in Earth's mantle and core ===\nWhen an earthquake occurs, seismographs near the [[epicenter]] are able to record both P and S waves, but those at a greater distance no longer detect the high frequencies of the first S wave.  Since shear waves cannot pass through liquids, this phenomenon was original evidence for the now well-established observation that the Earth has a liquid [[outer core]], as demonstrated by [[Richard Dixon Oldham]].  This kind of observation has also been used to argue, by [[Exploration geophysics|seismic testing]], that the [[Moon]] has a solid core, although recent geodetic studies suggest the core is still molten{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.\n\n== Notation ==\n[[File:Earthquake wave paths.svg|right|thumb|250px|Earthquake wave paths]]\nThe path that a wave takes between the focus and the observation point is often drawn as a ray diagram.  An example of this is shown in a figure above.  When reflections are taken into account there are an infinite number of paths that a wave can take.  Each path is denoted by a set of letters that describe the trajectory and phase through the Earth.  In general an upper case denotes a transmitted wave and a lower case denotes a reflected wave.  The two exceptions to this seem to be \"g\" and \"n\".<ref>The notation is taken from {{cite book|last1=Bullen|first1=K.E.|last2=Bolt|first2=Bruce A.|title=An introduction to the theory of seismology|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521283892|edition=4th}} and {{cite book|editor-last1=Lee|editor-first1=William H.K.|editor-first2=Paul |editor-last2=Jennings |editor-first3=Carl |editor-last3=Kisslinger |editor-first4=Hiroo |display-editors = 3 |editor-last4=Kanamori |title=International handbook of earthquake and engineering seismology.|date=2002|publisher=Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080489223}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=<!-- Staff writer --> |title=IASPEI standard phase list |url=http://www.isc.ac.uk/standards/phases/ |publisher=International Seismological Centre |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| c || the wave reflects off the outer core\n|-\n| d || a wave that has been reflected off a discontinuity at depth d\n|-\n| g || a wave that only travels through the crust\n|-\n| i || a wave that reflects off the inner core\n|-\n| I || a P-wave in the inner core\n|-\n| h || a reflection off a discontinuity in the inner core\n|-\n| J || an S wave in the inner core\n|-\n| K || a P-wave in the outer core\n|-\n| L || a Love wave sometimes called LT-Wave (Both caps, while an Lt is different)\n|-\n| n || a wave that travels along the boundary between the crust and mantle\n|-\n| P || a P wave in the mantle\n|-\n| p || a P wave ascending to the surface from the focus\n|-\n| R || a Rayleigh wave\n|-\n| S || an S wave in the mantle\n|-\n| s || an S wave ascending to the surface from the focus\n|-\n| w || the wave reflects off the bottom of the ocean\n|-\n| || No letter is used when the wave reflects off of the surfaces\n|}\n\nFor example:\n* '''ScP''' is a wave that begins traveling towards the center of the Earth as an S wave.  Upon reaching the outer core the wave reflects as a P wave.\n* '''sPKIKP''' is a wave path that begins traveling towards the surface as an S-wave.  At the surface it reflects as a P-wave. The P-wave then travels through the outer core, the inner core, the outer core, and the mantle.\n\n== Usefulness of P and S waves in locating an event ==\n[[File:Hypocenter Calculation.png|thumb|The Hypocenter/Epicenter of an earthquake is calculated by using the seismic data of that earthquake from at least three different locations.]]\nIn the case of local or nearby earthquakes, the difference in the [[arrival time]]s of the P and S waves can be used to determine the distance to the event. In the case of earthquakes that have occurred at global distances, three or more geographically diverse observing stations (using a common [[clock]]) recording P-wave arrivals permits the computation of a unique time and location on the planet for the event. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of P-wave arrivals are used to calculate [[hypocenter]]s. The misfit generated by a hypocenter calculation is known as \"the residual\". Residuals of 0.5 second or less are typical for distant events, residuals of 0.1\u20130.2 s typical for local events, meaning most reported P arrivals fit the computed hypocenter that well. Typically a location program will start by assuming the event occurred at a depth of about 33&nbsp;km; then it minimizes the residual by adjusting depth. Most events occur at depths shallower than about 40&nbsp;km, but some occur as deep as 700&nbsp;km.\n[[Image:Ondes P et S 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|P- and S-waves sharing with the propagation]]\nA quick way to determine the distance from a location to the origin of a seismic wave less than 200&nbsp;km away is to take the difference in arrival time of the P wave and the S wave in [[second]]s and multiply by 8&nbsp;kilometers per second.  Modern seismic arrays use more complicated [[earthquake location]] techniques.\n\nAt teleseismic distances, the first arriving P waves have necessarily travelled deep into the mantle, and perhaps have even refracted into the outer core of the planet, before travelling back up to the Earth's surface where the seismographic stations are located. The waves travel more quickly than if they had traveled in a straight line from the earthquake.  This is due to the appreciably increased [[Speed of sound#Three-dimensional solids|velocities]] within the planet, and is termed [[Huygens' Principle]]. [[Density]] in the planet increases with depth, which would slow the waves, but the [[Young's modulus|modulus]] of the rock increases much more, so deeper means faster. Therefore, a longer route can take a shorter time.\n\nThe travel time must be calculated very accurately in order to compute a precise hypocenter. Since P waves move at many kilometers per second, being off on travel-time calculation by even a half second can mean an error of many kilometers in terms of distance.  In practice, P arrivals from many stations are used and the errors cancel out, so the computed epicenter is likely to be quite accurate, on the order of 10\u201350&nbsp;km or so around the world.  Dense arrays of nearby sensors such as those that exist in California can provide accuracy of roughly a kilometer, and much greater accuracy is possible when timing is measured directly by [[cross-correlation]] of [[seismogram]] waveforms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adams\u2013Williamson equation]]\n*[[Helioseismology]]\n*[[Reflection seismology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|first1=Peter M. |last1=Shearer|title=Introduction to Seismology|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88210-1 |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikibooks |Historical Geology|Seismic waves}}\n*[http://www.kuleuven.be/bwm/edt EDT: A MATLAB Website for seismic wave propagation]\n\n{{Geophysics navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seismic Wave}}\n[[Category:Seismology]]\n[[Category:Surface waves]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Waves of energy that travel through the Earth's layers, and are a result of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, magma movement, large landslides and large man-made explosions}}\n{{about|waves that travel through the Earth|ocean waves sometimes called \"seismic sea waves\"|Tsunami}}\n{{Earthquakes}}\n[[Image:Pswaves.jpg|right|thumb|Body waves and surface waves]]\n\n[[Image:Seismogram.gif|thumb|p-wave and s-wave from seismograph]]\n\n[[File:Speeds of seismic waves.PNG|thumb|Velocity of seismic waves in the Earth versus depth.<ref name=Helffrich>{{cite journal |journal=Nature |year=2002 |volume=412 |issue=2 August |title=The Earth's mantle |author1=G.

[[P-waves]] are pressure waves that travel faster than other waves through the earth to arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name \"Primary\".

Following an earthquake event, S-waves arrive at seismograph stations after the faster-moving P-waves and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Depending on the propagational direction, the wave can take on different surface characteristics; for example, in the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other.

S-waves are slower than P-waves, and speeds are typically around 60% of that of P-waves in any given material. Shear waves can't travel through any liquid medium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/static/earthquakes/cur-seismic.html|title=Seismic Waves|publisher=[[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]]|accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref> so the absence of S-wave in earth's outer core suggests a liquid state.\n\n=== Surface waves ===\nSeismic surface waves travel along the Earth's surface. They can be classified as a form of [[Surface wave#Mechanical waves|mechanical surface wave]]s. They are called surface waves, as they diminish as they get further from the surface. They travel more slowly than seismic body waves (P and S). In large earthquakes, surface waves can have an amplitude of several centimeters.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sammis, C.G.|author2=Henyey, T.L.|title=Geophysics Field Measurements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOaUVakFYwkC&pg=PA12|date=1987|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-086012-1|page=12}}</ref>\n\n==== Rayleigh waves ====\n{{Main|Rayleigh wave}} \nRayleigh waves, also called ground roll, are surface waves that travel as ripples with motions that are similar to those of waves on the surface of water (note, however, that the associated particle motion at shallow depths is retrograde, and that the restoring force in Rayleigh and in other seismic waves is elastic, not gravitational as for water waves). The existence of these waves was predicted by John William Strutt, [[Lord Rayleigh]], in 1885. They are slower than body waves, roughly 90% of the velocity of S waves for typical homogeneous elastic media. In a layered medium (like the crust and [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]]) the velocity of the Rayleigh waves depends on their frequency and wavelength. See also [[Lamb waves]].\n\n==== Love waves ====\n{{Main|Love wave}}\nLove waves are horizontally [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] [[shear wave]]s (SH waves), existing only in the presence of a [[semi-infinite]] medium overlain by an upper layer of finite thickness.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Sheriff, R. E., Geldart, L. P. | year=1995 | title=Exploration Seismology |edition=2nd | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-46826-4 |page= 52}}</ref>  They are named after [[A.E.H. Love]], a British mathematician who created a mathematical model of the waves in 1911.  They usually travel slightly faster than Rayleigh waves, about 90% of the S wave velocity, and have the largest amplitude.\n\n==== Stoneley waves ====\n{{Main|Stoneley wave}}\nA Stoneley wave is a type of boundary wave (or interface wave) that propagates along a solid-fluid boundary or, under specific conditions, also along a solid-solid boundary. Amplitudes of Stoneley waves have their maximum values at the boundary between the two contacting media and decay exponentially towards the depth of each of them. These waves can be generated along the walls of a fluid-filled [[borehole]], being an important source of coherent noise in [[Vertical seismic profile|VSPs]] and making up the low frequency component of the source in [[sonic logging]].<ref>[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=Stoneley%20wave Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Stoneley wave.]</ref>\nThe equation for Stoneley waves was first given by Dr. Robert Stoneley (1894\u20131976), Emeritus Professor of Seismology, Cambridge.<ref>[http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/pid/5825;jsessionid=B80DF900AFFC974028AEFB7138FB1BDF Robert Stoneley, 1929 \u2013 2008.. Obituary of his son with reference to discovery of Stoneley waves.]</ref>\n\n==== Normal modes ====\n[[File:Fundametal toroidal oscillation Earth.gif|thumb|right|The sense of motion for toroidal <sub>0</sub>T<sub>1</sub> oscillation for two moments of time.]]\n[[File:Fundamental spheroidal oscillation Earth.gif|thumb|right|The scheme of motion for spheroidal <sub>0</sub>S<sub>2</sub> oscillation.Dashed lines give nodal (zero) lines. Arrows give the sense of motion.]]\nFree oscillations of the Earth are [[standing wave]]s, the result of interference between two surface waves traveling in opposite directions. Interference of Rayleigh waves results in ''spheroidal oscillation S'' while interference of Love waves gives ''toroidal oscillation T''. The modes of oscillations are specified by three numbers, e.g.,  <sub>n</sub>S<sub>l</sub><sup>m</sup>, where ''l'' is the angular order number (or ''spherical harmonic degree'', see [[Spherical harmonics]] for more details). The number ''m'' is the azimuthal order number. It may take on 2''l''+1 values from -''l'' to +''l''. The number ''n'' is the ''radial order number''. It means the wave with ''n'' zero crossings in radius. For spherically symmetric Earth the period for given ''n'' and ''l'' does not depend on ''m''.\n\nSome examples of spheroidal oscillations are the  \"breathing\" mode <sub>0</sub>S<sub>0</sub>, which involves an expansion and contraction of the whole Earth, and has a period of about 20 minutes; and the \"rugby\" mode <sub>0</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, which involves expansions along two alternating directions, and has a period of about 54 minutes. The mode <sub>0</sub>S<sub>1</sub> does not exist because it would require a change in the center of gravity, which would require an external force.<ref name=Shearer2009ch8/>\n\nOf the fundamental toroidal modes, <sub>0</sub>T<sub>1</sub> represents changes in Earth's rotation rate; although this occurs, it is much too slow to be useful in seismology. The mode <sub>0</sub>T<sub>2</sub> describes a twisting of the northern and southern hemispheres relative to each other; it has a period of about 44 minutes.<ref name=Shearer2009ch8/>\n\nThe first observations of free oscillations of the Earth were done during the great [[Chile earthquake 1960|1960 earthquake in Chile]]. Presently periods of thousands of modes are known. These data are used for determining some large scale structures of the Earth interior.\n\n=== P and S waves in Earth's mantle and core ===\nWhen an earthquake occurs, seismographs near the [[epicenter]] are able to record both P and S waves, but those at a greater distance no longer detect the high frequencies of the first S wave.  Since shear waves cannot pass through liquids, this phenomenon was original evidence for the now well-established observation that the Earth has a liquid [[outer core]], as demonstrated by [[Richard Dixon Oldham]].  This kind of observation has also been used to argue, by [[Exploration geophysics|seismic testing]], that the [[Moon]] has a solid core, although recent geodetic studies suggest the core is still molten{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.\n\n== Notation ==\n[[File:Earthquake wave paths.svg|right|thumb|250px|Earthquake wave paths]]\nThe path that a wave takes between the focus and the observation point is often drawn as a ray diagram.  An example of this is shown in a figure above.  When reflections are taken into account there are an infinite number of paths that a wave can take.  Each path is denoted by a set of letters that describe the trajectory and phase through the Earth.  In general an upper case denotes a transmitted wave and a lower case denotes a reflected wave.  The two exceptions to this seem to be \"g\" and \"n\".<ref>The notation is taken from {{cite book|last1=Bullen|first1=K.E.|last2=Bolt|first2=Bruce A.|title=An introduction to the theory of seismology|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521283892|edition=4th}} and {{cite book|editor-last1=Lee|editor-first1=William H.K.|editor-first2=Paul |editor-last2=Jennings |editor-first3=Carl |editor-last3=Kisslinger |editor-first4=Hiroo |display-editors = 3 |editor-last4=Kanamori |title=International handbook of earthquake and engineering seismology.|date=2002|publisher=Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080489223}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=<!-- Staff writer --> |title=IASPEI standard phase list |url=http://www.isc.ac.uk/standards/phases/ |publisher=International Seismological Centre |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| c || the wave reflects off the outer core\n|-\n| d || a wave that has been reflected off a discontinuity at depth d\n|-\n| g || a wave that only travels through the crust\n|-\n| i || a wave that reflects off the inner core\n|-\n| I || a P-wave in the inner core\n|-\n| h || a reflection off a discontinuity in the inner core\n|-\n| J || an S wave in the inner core\n|-\n| K || a P-wave in the outer core\n|-\n| L || a Love wave sometimes called LT-Wave (Both caps, while an Lt is different)\n|-\n| n || a wave that travels along the boundary between the crust and mantle\n|-\n| P || a P wave in the mantle\n|-\n| p || a P wave ascending to the surface from the focus\n|-\n| R || a Rayleigh wave\n|-\n| S || an S wave in the mantle\n|-\n| s || an S wave ascending to the surface from the focus\n|-\n| w || the wave reflects off the bottom of the ocean\n|-\n| || No letter is used when the wave reflects off of the surfaces\n|}\n\nFor example:\n* '''ScP''' is a wave that begins traveling towards the center of the Earth as an S wave.  Upon reaching the outer core the wave reflects as a P wave.\n* '''sPKIKP''' is a wave path that begins traveling towards the surface as an S-wave.  At the surface it reflects as a P-wave. The P-wave then travels through the outer core, the inner core, the outer core, and the mantle.\n\n== Usefulness of P and S waves in locating an event ==\n[[File:Hypocenter Calculation.png|thumb|The Hypocenter/Epicenter of an earthquake is calculated by using the seismic data of that earthquake from at least three different locations.]]\nIn the case of local or nearby earthquakes, the difference in the [[arrival time]]s of the P and S waves can be used to determine the distance to the event. In the case of earthquakes that have occurred at global distances, three or more geographically diverse observing stations (using a common [[clock]]) recording P-wave arrivals permits the computation of a unique time and location on the planet for the event. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of P-wave arrivals are used to calculate [[hypocenter]]s. The misfit generated by a hypocenter calculation is known as \"the residual\". Residuals of 0.5 second or less are typical for distant events, residuals of 0.1\u20130.2 s typical for local events, meaning most reported P arrivals fit the computed hypocenter that well. Typically a location program will start by assuming the event occurred at a depth of about 33&nbsp;km; then it minimizes the residual by adjusting depth. Most events occur at depths shallower than about 40&nbsp;km, but some occur as deep as 700&nbsp;km.\n[[Image:Ondes P et S 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|P- and S-waves sharing with the propagation]]\nA quick way to determine the distance from a location to the origin of a seismic wave less than 200&nbsp;km away is to take the difference in arrival time of the P wave and the S wave in [[second]]s and multiply by 8&nbsp;kilometers per second.  Modern seismic arrays use more complicated [[earthquake location]] techniques.\n\nAt teleseismic distances, the first arriving P waves have necessarily travelled deep into the mantle, and perhaps have even refracted into the outer core of the planet, before travelling back up to the Earth's surface where the seismographic stations are located. The waves travel more quickly than if they had traveled in a straight line from the earthquake.  This is due to the appreciably increased [[Speed of sound#Three-dimensional solids|velocities]] within the planet, and is termed [[Huygens' Principle]]. [[Density]] in the planet increases with depth, which would slow the waves, but the [[Young's modulus|modulus]] of the rock increases much more, so deeper means faster. Therefore, a longer route can take a shorter time.\n\nThe travel time must be calculated very accurately in order to compute a precise hypocenter. Since P waves move at many kilometers per second, being off on travel-time calculation by even a half second can mean an error of many kilometers in terms of distance.  In practice, P arrivals from many stations are used and the errors cancel out, so the computed epicenter is likely to be quite accurate, on the order of 10\u201350&nbsp;km or so around the world.  Dense arrays of nearby sensors such as those that exist in California can provide accuracy of roughly a kilometer, and much greater accuracy is possible when timing is measured directly by [[cross-correlation]] of [[seismogram]] waveforms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adams\u2013Williamson equation]]\n*[[Helioseismology]]\n*[[Reflection seismology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|first1=Peter M. |last1=Shearer|title=Introduction to Seismology|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88210-1 |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikibooks |Historical Geology|Seismic waves}}\n*[http://www.kuleuven.be/bwm/edt EDT: A MATLAB Website for seismic wave propagation]\n\n{{Geophysics navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seismic Wave}}\n[[Category:Seismology]]\n[[Category:Surface waves]]\n", "name_user": "50.123.189.91", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave"}

Every Asian civilization is represented in the Met's Asian department, and the pieces on display include every type of decorative art, from painting and printmaking to sculpture and metalworking. The department is well known for its comprehensive collection of [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]], as well as for its Indian sculptures, [[Nepal]]ese and [[Tibet]]an works, and the arts of Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia and Thailand.

These models depict, in unparalleled detail, a cross-section of Egyptian life in the early [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]: boats, gardens, and scenes of daily life are represented in miniature. [[William the Faience Hippopotamus]] is a miniature shown at right.\n\nHowever, the popular centerpiece of the Egyptian Art department continues to be the [[Temple of Dendur]]. Dismantled by the Egyptian government to save it from rising waters caused by the building of the [[Aswan High Dam]], the large [[sandstone]] temple was given to the United States in 1965 and assembled in the Met's Sackler Wing in 1978. Situated in a large room and partially surrounded by a reflecting pool and illuminated by a wall of windows opening onto Central Park, the Temple of Dendur has been one of the Met's most enduring attractions.

While a great deal of European medieval art is on display in these galleries, most of the European pieces are concentrated at the Cloisters (see below). However, this allows the main galleries to display much of the Met's Byzantine art side by side with European pieces. The main gallery is host to a wide range of tapestries and church and funerary statuary, while side galleries display smaller works of precious metals and ivory, including [[reliquary]] pieces and secular items. The main gallery, with its high arched ceiling, also serves double duty as the annual site of the Met's elaborately decorated Christmas tree.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===== The Cloisters museum and gardens =====\n{{Main|The Cloisters}}\n[[File:The Cloisters Hudson River crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[The Cloisters]] from the Hudson River]]\n[[File:The Cloisters - The MET Cloisters - Joy of Museums - 2.jpg|thumb|Photo of the interior of the Cloisters]]\nThe Cloisters was a principal project of [[John D.

By the time she died, the collection had 3,600 instruments that she had donated and the collection was housed in five galleries. Instruments were (and continue to be) included in the collection not only on aesthetic grounds, but also insofar as they embodied technical and social aspects of their cultures of origin. The modern Musical Instruments collection is encyclopedic in scope; every continent is represented at virtually every stage of its musical life. Highlights of the department's collection include several [[Antonio Stradivari|Stradivari]] [[violin]]s, a collection of [[Asia]]n instruments made from precious metals, and the oldest surviving [[piano]], a 1720 model by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]].

[[Alfred Stieglitz]], a famous photographer himself, donated the first major collection of photographs to the museum, which included a comprehensive survey of [[Pictorialism|Photo-Secessionist]] works, a rich set of master prints by [[Edward Steichen]], and an outstanding collection of Stieglitz's photographs from his own studio. The Met supplemented Stieglitz's gift with the 8,500-piece [[Gilman Paper Company Collection]], the Rubel Collection, and the Ford Motor Company Collection, which respectively provided the collection with early French and American photography, early British photography, and post-[[World War I|WWI]] American and European photography. The museum also acquired [[Walker Evans]]'s personal collection of photographs, a particular coup considering the high demand for his works. The department of photography was founded in 1992. Though the department gained a permanent gallery in 1997, not all of the department's holdings are on display at any given time, due to the sensitive materials represented in the photography collection. However, the Photographs department has produced some of the best-received temporary exhibits in the Met's recent past, including a [[Diane Arbus]] retrospective and an extensive show devoted to spirit photography.

The Met supplemented Stieglitz's gift with the 8,500-piece [[Gilman Paper Company Collection]], the Rubel Collection, and the Ford Motor Company Collection, which respectively provided the collection with early French and American photography, early British photography, and post-[[World War I|WWI]] American and European photography. The museum also acquired [[Walker Evans]]'s personal collection of photographs, a particular coup considering the high demand for his works. The department of photography was founded in 1992. Though the department gained a permanent gallery in 1997, not all of the department's holdings are on display at any given time, due to the sensitive materials represented in the photography collection. However, the Photographs department has produced some of the best-received temporary exhibits in the Met's recent past, including a [[Diane Arbus]] retrospective and an extensive show devoted to spirit photography.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Musically, ''Artpop'' is an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[synth-pop]] album, with influences from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Techno|techno]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and [[dubstep]], among other genres. The themes of the album revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. In 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]'', Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions and new vinyl and CD pressings of the album.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Musically, ''Artpop''is an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[synth-pop]] album, with influences from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Techno|techno]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and [[dubstep]], among other genres. The themes of the album revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. In 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]'', Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions and new vinyl and CD pressings of the album.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

To do this, she has utilised the genetic diversity of Australian animals (specifically the kangaroo, platypus, Tasmanian devils and dragons (lizards)). Her work had led to significant and influential new theories on the origin and evolution of the human sex chromosomes and sex determination, including the controversial prediction that the human Y chromosome is disappearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/02/23/3437874.htm|title=Many years of life left in Y chromosome|last=Thursday|first=23 February 2012 ABC/AFP|date=2012-02-23|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref> She also made the critical discovery that the epigenetic silencing of mammalian X chromosomes occurs by transcriptional inhibition, and that this is mediated by DNA methylation. In the mid-1980s, Graves became involved in international comparative gene mapping and sequencing projects, where she promoted the value of including distantly related species in comparative genomics analyses and initiated projects to sequence the genomes of Australian marsupials and the platypus.

[[Sex-determination system|Sex determination]] in placental mammals (including marsupials) results from a testis-determining gene on the Y chromosome. Via comparative genomics, Graves and Sinclair showed that ''ZFY'' is found on chromosome 5 in [[kangaroo]]<nowiki/>s and chromosome 3 in the [[fat-tailed dunnart]] rather than the Y chromosome, and therefore could not be involved in determining sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Andrew H.|last2=Foster|first2=Jamie W.|last3=Spencer|first3=James A.|last4=Page|first4=David C.|last5=Palmer|first5=Mark|last6=Goodfellow|first6=Peter N.|last7=Graves|first7=Jennifer A.

Owing to this work, the emergence of mammalian sex chromosomes could be dated back to between 160-190 million years ago, between the divergence of therian mammals from monotremes and the divergence of the marsupial-eutherian species.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nGraves' work on sex determination led to the discovery that the Australian reptile the [[Agamidae|dragon lizard]] exhibits both genetic and temperature dependent sex determination. At normal temperatures, the sex of offspring is determined via genetic factors (ZZ male, ZY female) as two copies of this Z-borne gene (ZZ) are required to induce testis formation. At higher temperatures, however, all hatchlings are female. It is proposed that this occurs due to heat inactivation of a dose sensitive Z-borne gene, resulting in ZZ hatchlings with insufficient sex determination product. Due to this reduced dose, ZZ hatchlings develop into sex-reversed females.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Jennifer A.

To do this, she has utilised the genetic diversity of Australian animals (specifically the kangaroo, platypus, Tasmanian devils and dragons (lizards)). Her work had led to significant and influential new theories on the origin and evolution of the human sex chromosomes and sex determination, including the controversial prediction that the human Y chromosome is disappearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/02/23/3437874.htm|title=Many years of life left in Y chromosome|last=Thursday|first=23 February 2012 ABC/AFP|date=2012-02-23|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref> She also made the critical discovery that the epigenetic silencing of mammalian X chromosomes occurs by transcriptional inhibition, and that this is mediated by DNA methylation. In the mid-1980s, Graves became involved in international comparative gene mapping and sequencing projects, where she promoted the value of including distantly related species in comparative genomics analyses and initiated projects to sequence the genomes of Australian marsupials and the platypus. In 2001 she became head of the Comparative Genomics Research Unit and Director of the ARC Centre for Excellence in Kangaroo Genomics, based at the Research School of Biological Sciences at the [[Australian National University]].<ref name=\":0\" /> During this time she worked extensively with Associate Professor [[Janine Deakin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/deakin-j|title=Ms Janine Deakin - Researchers - ANU|date=2014-08-19|access-date=2019-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819092511/https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/deakin-j|archive-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Graves was elected as Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of Science]].

[[Sex-determination system|Sex determination]] in placental mammals (including marsupials) results from a testis-determining gene on the Y chromosome. Via comparative genomics, Graves and Sinclair showed that ''ZFY'' is found on chromosome 5 in [[kangaroo]]<nowiki/>s and chromosome 3 in the [[fat-tailed dunnart]] rather than the Y chromosome, and therefore could not be involved in determining sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Andrew H.|last2=Foster|first2=Jamie W.|last3=Spencer|first3=James A.|last4=Page|first4=David C.|last5=Palmer|first5=Mark|last6=Goodfellow|first6=Peter N.|last7=Graves|first7=Jennifer A.

Owing to this work, the emergence of mammalian sex chromosomes could be dated back to between 160-190 million years ago, between the divergence of therian mammals from monotremes and the divergence of the marsupial-eutherian species.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nGraves' work on sex determination led to the discovery that the Australian reptile the [[Agamidae|dragon lizard]] exhibits both genetic and temperature dependent sex determination. At normal temperatures, the sex of offspring is determined via genetic factors (ZZ male, ZY female) as two copies of this Z-borne gene (ZZ) are required to induce testis formation. At higher temperatures, however, all hatchlings are female. It is proposed that this occurs due to heat inactivation of a dose sensitive Z-borne gene, resulting in ZZ hatchlings with insufficient sex determination product. Due to this reduced dose, ZZ hatchlings develop into sex-reversed females.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Jennifer A.

Scrope was tricked into disbanding his army on 29 May, and he and his allies were arrested. Henry IV denied them trial by their peers, and Willoughby was among the commissioners<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=662}}.</ref> who sat in judgment on Scrope in his own hall at his manor of Bishopthorpe, some three miles south of [[York]]. The Chief Justice, [[William Gascoigne|Sir William Gascoigne]], refused to participate in such irregular proceedings and to pronounce judgment on a prelate, and it was thus left to the lawyer Sir William Fulthorpe to condemn Scrope to death for treason. Scrope was beheaded under the walls of York before a great crowd on 8 June 1405, 'the first English prelate to suffer judicial execution'.<ref>{{Harvnb|McNiven|2004}}.</ref> On 12 July 1405 Willoughby was granted lands forfeited by the rebel Earl of Northumberland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=662}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1406 Willoughby was again appointed to the Council.
