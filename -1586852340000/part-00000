The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the [[rachis]]. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or '''barbs'''; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the '''barbules'''. These barbules have minute hooks called '''barbicels''' for cross-attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular ''calamus'' (or [[quill]]) which inserts into a [[Hair follicle|follicle]] in the [[skin]]. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes. This part is embedded within the skin follicle and has an opening at the base (proximal umbilicus) and a small opening on the side (distal umbilicus).<ref name=atlas>{{Cite book|title=A color atlas of avian anatomy|last= McLelland| first=J.|publisher=W.B.

The individual feathers in the wings and tail play important roles in controlling flight.<ref name=\"Wang 2016 1600360\"/> Some species have a [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] of feathers on their heads. Although feathers are light, a bird's plumage weighs two or three times more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as [[camouflage]] against [[predator]]s for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different, in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the [[sexual dimorphism]] of many bird species and are particularly important in selection of mating pairs. In some cases there are differences in the UV reflectivity of feathers across sexes even though no differences in color are noted in the visible range.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The ubiquity of avian ultraviolet plumage reflectance|first1= Muir D. |last1= Eaton |first2= Scott M. |last2= Lanyon|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences| volume= 270| issue= 1525| year= 2003| pages=1721\u20131726|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2431|pmid=12965000|pmc=1691429}}</ref> The wing feathers of male [[club-winged manakin]]s ''Machaeropterus deliciosus'' have special structures that are used to produce sounds by [[stridulation]].<ref>{{Cite journal| title= Courting Bird Sings with Stridulating Wing Feathers| last1= Bostwick| first1= Kimberly S.| last2= Richard O.| first2= Prum| year= 2005| journal= Science| volume= 309| issue= 5735| pages= 736| doi= 10.1126/science.1111701| pmid= 16051789| url= http://cumv.bio.cornell.edu/pdf/Bostwick_Prum_2005_manuscript.pdf| access-date= 19 July 2010| url-status= live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100707152805/http://cumv.bio.cornell.edu/pdf/Bostwick_Prum_2005_manuscript.pdf| archive-date= 7 July 2010| df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:GuineaFeather.jpg|thumb|left|A contour feather from a [[Guinea fowl]]]]\nSome birds have a supply of [[powder down]] feathers which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from the ends of the barbules. These particles produce a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather [[conditioner (chemistry)|conditioner]]. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder.<ref name=delhey/> Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to [[emulsion|emulsifying agents]] due to human pollution.

New studies are suggesting that the unique feathers of birds is also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which a different species build their nests. Since females are the prime care givers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colored down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds' plumage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = T.

Since the female is the main care giver in some species of birds, evolution has helped select traits that make her feathers dull and often allow her to blend into the surroundings. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten.

However, a 2018 study of two small, well-preserved pterosaur fossils from the [[Jurassic]] of [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]] indicated that pterosaurs were covered in an array of differently-structured pycnofibres (rather than just filamentous ones), with several of these structures displaying diagnostic features of feathers, such as non-veined grouped filaments and bilaterally branched filaments, both of which were originally thought to be exclusive to birds and other maniraptoran dinosaurs. Given these findings, it is possible that feathers have deep evolutionary origins in ancestral [[archosaur]]s, though there is also a possibility that these structures independently evolved to resemble bird feathers via [[convergent evolution]]. Mike Benton, the study's senior author, lent credence to the former theory, stating \"We couldn\u2019t find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|last2=Xu|first2=Xing|last3=Orr|first3=Patrick J.|last4=Kaye|first4=Thomas G.|last5=Pittman|first5=Michael|last6=Kearns|first6=Stuart L.|last7=McNamara|first7=Maria E.|last8=Jiang|first8=Baoyu|last9=Yang|first9=Zixiao|date=January 2019|title=Pterosaur integumentary structures with complex feather-like branching|journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24\u201330|doi=10.1038/s41559-018-0728-7|pmid=30568282|issn=2397-334X|hdl=1983/1f7893a1-924d-4cb3-a4bf-c4b1592356e9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/paleontology/pterosaur-feathers-06733.html|title=Pterosaurs Had Four Types of Feathers, New Study Shows {{!}} Paleontology {{!}} Sci-News.com|website=Breaking Science News {{!}} Sci-News.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20181217\">{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Feathers and Fur Fly Over Pterosaur Fossil Finding - An analysis of two fossils would push back the origins of feathers by about 70 million years, but more specimens may be needed for confirmation. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/pterosaur-feathers-fur.html |date=17 December 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 December 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46572782|title=Fur flies over new pterosaur fossils|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2018-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-12-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n</div>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Feather development]]\n* [[Delayed feathering in chickens]]\n* [[Hen feathering in cocks]]\n* [[List of poultry feathers]]\n* [[Pinioning]]\n* [[Plumage]]\n* [[White feather]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|title=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle|last=Hanson|first=Thor|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=9780465020133|location=New York|oclc=727106416|title-link=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Feather|Feather}}\n{{Wiktionary|pluma|calamus}}\n* {{cite journal| year=1916|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924000147953#page/n41/mode/1up/ |last= Chandler|first= Asa C.| title=A study of the structure of feathers, with reference to their taxonomic significance|journal=University of California Publications in Zoology| volume=13| issue=1| pages=243\u2013446 |ref=harv}}\n* McGraw, K.

A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the [[rachis]]. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or '''barbs'''; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the '''barbules'''. These barbules have minute hooks called '''barbicels''' for cross-attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular ''calamus'' (or [[quill]]) which inserts into a [[Hair follicle|follicle]] in the [[skin]]. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes. This part is embedded within the skin follicle and has an opening at the base (proximal umbilicus) and a small opening on the side (distal umbilicus).<ref name=atlas>{{Cite book|title=A color atlas of avian anatomy|last= McLelland| first=J.|publisher=W.B.

Although feathers are light, a bird's plumage weighs two or three times more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as [[camouflage]] against [[predator]]s for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different, in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the [[sexual dimorphism]] of many bird species and are particularly important in selection of mating pairs.

New studies are suggesting that the unique feathers of birds is also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which a different species build their nests. Since females are the prime care givers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colored down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds' plumage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = T.

Since the female is the main care giver in some species of birds, evolution has helped select traits that make her feathers dull and often allow her to blend into the surroundings. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten.

Norman]] and Paul Barrett (2017) found that [[Theropoda]] is actually more closely related to [[Ornithischia]], to which it formed the [[sister group]] within the [[clade]] [[Ornithoscelida]]. The study also suggested that if the feather-like structures of theropods and ornithischians are of common evolutionary origin then it would be possible that feathers were restricted to Ornithoscelida.

Foth re-interpreted stage 2 feathers as crushed or misidentified feathers of at least stage 3, and stage 5 feathers as crushed stage 6 feathers.<ref name=\"foth2011\">Foth, C.

However, a 2018 study of two small, well-preserved pterosaur fossils from the [[Jurassic]] of [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]] indicated that pterosaurs were covered in an array of differently-structured pycnofibres (rather than just filamentous ones), with several of these structures displaying diagnostic features of feathers, such as non-veined grouped filaments and bilaterally branched filaments, both of which were originally thought to be exclusive to birds and other maniraptoran dinosaurs. Given these findings, it is possible that feathers have deep evolutionary origins in ancestral [[archosaur]]s, though there is also a possibility that these structures independently evolved to resemble bird feathers via [[convergent evolution]]. Mike Benton, the study's senior author, lent credence to the former theory, stating \"We couldn\u2019t find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|last2=Xu|first2=Xing|last3=Orr|first3=Patrick J.|last4=Kaye|first4=Thomas G.|last5=Pittman|first5=Michael|last6=Kearns|first6=Stuart L.|last7=McNamara|first7=Maria E.|last8=Jiang|first8=Baoyu|last9=Yang|first9=Zixiao|date=January 2019|title=Pterosaur integumentary structures with complex feather-like branching|journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24\u201330|doi=10.1038/s41559-018-0728-7|pmid=30568282|issn=2397-334X|hdl=1983/1f7893a1-924d-4cb3-a4bf-c4b1592356e9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/paleontology/pterosaur-feathers-06733.html|title=Pterosaurs Had Four Types of Feathers, New Study Shows {{!}} Paleontology {{!}} Sci-News.com|website=Breaking Science News {{!}} Sci-News.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20181217\">{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Feathers and Fur Fly Over Pterosaur Fossil Finding - An analysis of two fossils would push back the origins of feathers by about 70 million years, but more specimens may be needed for confirmation. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/pterosaur-feathers-fur.html |date=17 December 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 December 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46572782|title=Fur flies over new pterosaur fossils|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2018-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-12-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n</div>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Feather development]]\n* [[Delayed feathering in chickens]]\n* [[Hen feathering in cocks]]\n* [[List of poultry feathers]]\n* [[Pinioning]]\n* [[Plumage]]\n* [[White feather]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|title=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle|last=Hanson|first=Thor|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=9780465020133|location=New York|oclc=727106416|title-link=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Feather|Feather}}\n{{Wiktionary|pluma|calamus}}\n* {{cite journal| year=1916|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924000147953#page/n41/mode/1up/ |last= Chandler|first= Asa C.| title=A study of the structure of feathers, with reference to their taxonomic significance|journal=University of California Publications in Zoology| volume=13| issue=1| pages=243\u2013446 |ref=harv}}\n* McGraw, K.

It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The film stars [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Raf Vallone]], [[Eleonora Brown]], [[Carlo Ninchi]], and [[Andrea Checchi]]. The film was adapted by De Sica and [[Cesare Zavattini]] from the [[Two women (novel)|novel of the same name]] written by [[Alberto Moravia]]. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of 1944 in Rome and rural [[Lazio]], during what Italians call the ''[[Marocchinate]]''.<ref>[http://www.cassino2000.com/cdsc/studi/archivio/n07/n07p09.html 1952: Il caso delle \u201cmarocchinate\u201d al Parlamento] Accessed 9 December 2017</ref>\n\nLoren's performance received critical acclaim, winning her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nCesira (Loren) is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta (Brown), in Rome during [[World War II]]. Following the bombing of Rome, mother and daughter flee to Cesira's native [[Ciociaria]], a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira sleeps with Giovanni (Vallone), a coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence.\n\nAfter they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele (Belmondo), a young local intellectual with [[communist]] sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by [[Wehrmacht|German soldiers]], who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain.\n\nAfter the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of ''[[Moroccan Goumier]]s'' &ndash; soldiers attached to the invading [[Allied Armies in Italy]]. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child.\n\nWhen the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Cesira\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Michele Di Libero\n* [[Eleonora Brown]] as Rosetta\n* [[Carlo Ninchi]] as Filippo, Michele's father\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Giovanni\n* [[Andrea Checchi]] as A fascist\n* [[Pupella Maggio]] as Peasant\n* Bruna Cealti as Refugee\n* Antonella Della Porta as A crazy mother\n* Mario Frera\n* [[Franco Balducci]] as German in the haystack\n* Luciana Cortellesi\n* [[Curt Lowens]]\n* Tony Calio\n* Remo Galavotti\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a 1957 novel by [[Alberto Moravia]], ''La ciociara'' (''The Woman From Ciociaria''). It was inspired by Moravia's experiences during World War II.\n\n[[Carlo Ponti]] bought the film rights along with Marcello Girosi for a reported US$100,000. Sophia Loren was always meant to star and there was some talk that the film might be financed by Paramount, with whom Loren had made a number of movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=JAPANESE MOVIE WILL BE ADAPTED: Alciona, U.

It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The film stars [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Raf Vallone]], [[Eleonora Brown]], [[Carlo Ninchi]], and [[Andrea Checchi]]. The film was adapted by De Sica and [[Cesare Zavattini]] from the [[Two women (novel)|novel of the same name]] written by [[Alberto Moravia]]. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of 1944 in Rome and rural [[Lazio]], during what Italians call the ''[[Marocchinate]]''.<ref>[http://www.cassino2000.com/cdsc/studi/archivio/n07/n07p09.html 1952: Il caso delle \u201cmarocchinate\u201d al Parlamento] Accessed 9 December 2017</ref>\n\nLoren's performance received critical acclaim, winning her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nCesira (Loren) is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta (Brown), in Rome during [[World War II]]. Following the bombing of Romw, mother and daughter flee to Cesira's native [[Ciociaria]], a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira sleeps with Giovanni (Vallone), a coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence.\n\nAfter they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele (Belmondo), a young local intellectual with [[communist]] sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by [[Wehrmacht|German soldiers]], who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain.\n\nAfter the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of ''[[Moroccan Goumier]]s'' &ndash; soldiers attached to the invading [[Allied Armies in Italy]]. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child.\n\nWhen the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Cesira\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Michele Di Libero\n* [[Eleonora Brown]] as Rosetta\n* [[Carlo Ninchi]] as Filippo, Michele's father\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Giovanni\n* [[Andrea Checchi]] as A fascist\n* [[Pupella Maggio]] as Peasant\n* Bruna Cealti as Refugee\n* Antonella Della Porta as A crazy mother\n* Mario Frera\n* [[Franco Balducci]] as German in the haystack\n* Luciana Cortellesi\n* [[Curt Lowens]]\n* Tony Calio\n* Remo Galavotti\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a 1957 novel by [[Alberto Moravia]], ''La ciociara'' (''The Woman From Ciociaria''). It was inspired by Moravia's experiences during World War II.\n\n[[Carlo Ponti]] bought the film rights along with Marcello Girosi for a reported US$100,000. Sophia Loren was always meant to star and there was some talk that the film might be financed by Paramount, with whom Loren had made a number of movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=JAPANESE MOVIE WILL BE ADAPTED: Alciona, U.
